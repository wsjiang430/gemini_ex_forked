ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
​
Unless the context otherwise requires, “G-III,” “us,” “we” and “our” refer to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries. References to fiscal years refer to the year ended or ending on January 31 of that year. For example, our fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 is referred to as “fiscal 2023.”
​
G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. is a Delaware corporation that was formed in 1989. We and our predecessors have conducted our business since 1974.
​
Overview
​
We design, source and market an extensive range of apparel, including outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women’s suits and women’s performance wear, as well as women’s handbags, footwear, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. G-III has a substantial portfolio of more than 30 licensed and proprietary brands, anchored by our global power brands: DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. We are brand owners and licensees, and we distribute our products through multiple channels.
​
Our own proprietary brands include DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Eliza J, Jessica Howard, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Wilsons Leather and Sonia Rykiel. We sell products under an extensive portfolio of well-known licensed brands, including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Levi’s, Guess?, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan, Vince Camuto and Dockers. Beginning in January 2024, we will also sell products under the Nautica brand. Through our team sports business, we have licenses with the National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League and over 150 U.S. colleges and universities. We also source and sell products to major retailers under their private retail labels.
​
Our products are sold through a cross section of leading retailers such as Macy’s, including its Bloomingdale’s division, Dillard’s, Hudson’s Bay Company, including its Saks Fifth Avenue division, Nordstrom, Kohl’s, TJX Companies, Ross Stores and Burlington. We also sell our products using digital channels through retail partners such as macys.com, nordstrom.com and dillards.com, each of which has a substantial online business. In addition, we sell to leading online retail partners such as Amazon, Fanatics, Zalando and Zappos and have made minority investments in two e-commerce retailers.
​
We also distribute apparel and other products directly to consumers through our own DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Karl Lagerfeld Paris and Vilebrequin retail stores, as well as through our digital channels for the DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc, Wilsons Leather and Sonia Rykiel businesses.
​
We operate in fashion markets that are intensely competitive. Our ability to continuously evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes, across multiple market segments, distribution channels and geographic areas is critical to our success. Although our portfolio of brands is aimed at diversifying our risks in this regard, misjudging shifts in consumer preferences could have a negative effect on our business. Our success in the future will depend on our ability to design products that are accepted in the marketplace, source the manufacture of our products on a competitive basis, and continue to diversify our product portfolio and the markets we serve.
​
Segments
​
We report based on two segments: wholesale operations and retail operations.
​
Our wholesale operations segment includes sales of products to retailers under owned, licensed and private label brands, as well as sales related to the Vilebrequin and Karl Lagerfeld businesses, other than sales of product under the Karl Lagerfeld Paris brand from our retail stores and digital outlets. Wholesale revenues also include royalty revenues from license agreements related to our owned trademarks including DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, Sonia Rykiel, G.H. Bass and Andrew Marc.
​

Our retail operations segment consists primarily of direct sales to consumers through our company-operated stores and through digital channels. Our company-operated retail channels consist primarily of DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores, as well as the digital channels for DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc and Wilsons Leather. Substantially all DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores are operated as outlet stores.
​
Recent Developments
​
Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger License Extensions
​
In November 2022, we announced the extension of the licenses for Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger products. The amendments to the license agreements for these products provide for staggered extensions by category that expire beginning December 31, 2024 and continuing through December 31, 2027. See the table in “Wholesale Operations-Licensed Products” below for information with respect to the new extension term, any potential renewal term or the existing current term for the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger license agreements. 
​
PVH Corp., the owner of these two brands, has indicated that it intends to produce these products itself once the license agreements expire. Unless we are able to increase the sales of our other products, acquire new businesses and/or enter into other license agreements covering different products, the inability to renew the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger license agreements would cause a significant decrease in our net sales and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
​
We continue to strategize near-term growth initiatives across our current owned and licensed brands including category, geographical and digital expansion. Additionally, we are directing resources toward new growth areas, including building our own brands, broadening our European business, developing new licensing opportunities and continuing to seek to acquire new businesses. 
​
Karl Lagerfeld Acquisition
​
In May 2022, we acquired from a group of investors the remaining 81% in interests in the parent entity of the Karl Lagerfeld business that we did not already own, for an aggregate consideration of €202.0 million ($216.8 million) in cash, after taking into account certain adjustments. We funded the purchase price from cash on hand. See Note 15 – Karl Lagerfeld Acquisition in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.
​
The addition of the Karl Lagerfeld fashion brand to the G-III portfolio of owned brands advances several of our strategic initiatives, including increasing the direct ownership of brands, capitalizing on their licensing opportunities and further diversifying our global presence. This acquisition represents a significant opportunity to expand our international growth by further developing our European-based brands, which also include Vilebrequin and Sonia Rykiel. We believe that Karl Lagerfeld’s existing digital channel presence could enable us to enhance our omni-channel business and further accelerate our digital initiatives. The influential legacy of the Karl Lagerfeld brand embodies a creative expression that aligns with our goal to provide innovative products for our customers.
​
License Agreement with Nautica
​
In March 2023, we announced the signing of a long-term license with Authentic Brands Group for the Nautica brand in North America. Since being acquired in 2018 by Authentic Brands Group, Nautica’s relevance has expanded globally, and it has become one of their marquee brands. Celebrating its 40-year anniversary, Nautica is available in approximately 1,300 freestanding stores and shop-in-shops globally, along with a strong digital presence across more than 30 countries. 
​
We will produce across a number of categories starting with a full women’s jeanswear collection and then expanding in a phased approach into additional categories including sportswear, suit separates and dresses. The new five-year license agreement, effective beginning in January 2024, includes three extensions, for five years each. First deliveries are expected to hit the floor in January 2024. The product is expected to be distributed in better department stores, digital channels and Nautica’s stores and website in North America and franchised stores globally. We believe that significant opportunity

exists in the better women’s apparel space in categories where we have strong expertise. The Nautica brand joins our portfolio of some of the largest American brands in the world. 
​
Repositioning and Expansion of Donna Karan
​
We acquired the DKNY and Donna Karan brands, two of the most iconic American fashion brands, in December 2016. We initially repositioned and relaunched DKNY and have successfully grown the brand to approximately $600.0 million in annual net sales. We are now focused on the repositioning and expansion of the Donna Karan brand for Spring 2024. The new Donna Karan will be a modern system of dressing created to appeal to a woman’s senses on every level, addressing the full lifestyle needs of a new customer. Our Donna Karan product is expected to be distributed in better department stores, digital channels and our own Donna Karan website in North America and internationally. Donna Karan is widely considered a top fashion brand and is recognized as one of the most famous designer names in American fashion. We believe that the strength of the Donna Karan brand, along with our success with the DKNY brand, demonstrates the potential for our new Donna Karan products.
​
Strategic Initiatives 
​
We are focused on the following strategic initiatives, which we believe are critical to our long-term success: 
​

● | Owning brands: We own a portfolio of proprietary brands including DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, Eliza J, Jessica Howard, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc and Sonia Rykiel. Owning our own brands is advantageous to us for several reasons:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

- | We can realize significantly higher operating margins because we are not required to pay licensing fees on sales by us of our proprietary products and can also generate licensing revenues (which have no related cost of goods sold) for classes of products not manufactured by us.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | There are no channel restrictions, permitting us to market our products internationally, and to utilize a variety of different distribution channels, including online and off-price channels.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | We are able to license our proprietary brands in new categories and geographies to carefully selected licensees.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | We are able to build equity in these brands to benefit the long-term interests of our stockholders.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Continue to develop and expand our DKNY business and re-position and expand the Donna Karan business: We believe that DKNY and Donna Karan are two of the most iconic and recognizable power brands and that we are well positioned to unlock their potential and expand the reach of these brands. We are leveraging our demonstrated ability to drive organic growth and develop talent within our Company to maximize the potential of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands. Our strategy is for DKNY and Donna Karan to be more accessible brands, both designed and priced to reach a wider range of customers. We are focused on the re-positioning and expansion of the Donna Karan brand for Spring 2024. The new Donna Karan will be a modern system of dressing created to appeal to a woman’s senses on every level, addressing the full lifestyle needs of a new consumer. We believe there is untapped global licensing and distribution potential for these brands and aim to grow royalty streams in the DKNY and Donna Karan businesses through expansion of additional categories with existing licensees, as well as new categories with new licensees. We are committed to making DKNY and Donna Karan fashion and lifestyle brands of choice.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Continued focus on our global power brands: While we sell products under more than 30 licensed and proprietary brands, our global power brands anchor our business: DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld. Each of these brands has substantial name recognition and is well-known in the marketplace. We believe each brand also provides us with significant growth opportunities. We have leveraged the strength of our power brands to become a supplier of choice in a diversified range of product categories.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Expanding our international business: We continue to expand our international business and enter into new markets worldwide. In fiscal 2023, we acquired the remaining interests in the Karl Lagerfeld fashion brand which grew our European business and added new international expertise. In fiscal 2022, we purchased European luxury
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fashion brand Sonia Rykiel. We own Vilebrequin, a premier provider of status swimwear, resort wear and related accessories that was founded in Europe. We believe these brands can enable us to expand in the international space and that there is untapped potential for these brands. In addition, we believe that the international sales and profit opportunity is quite significant for our DKNY and Donna Karan businesses and, as a result, we are expanding our DKNY and Donna Karan businesses globally. Continued growth, brand development and marketing in overseas markets is critical to driving global brand recognition.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Increasing digital channel business opportunities: We are continuing to make changes to our business to address the additional challenges and opportunities created by the evolving role of the digital marketplace in the retail sector and expect to increase the sale of our products in an omni-channel environment. We are investing in digital personnel, marketing, logistics, planning, distribution and other strategic opportunities to expand our digital footprint. Consumers are increasingly engaging with brands through digital channels, and we believe that this trend will continue to grow in the coming years. Our global power brands serve as the anchor of our business and position us to be the direct beneficiaries of this trend, whether by continuing to leverage our partnerships with the digital channel businesses operated by our licensors and major retailers to facilitate customer engagement or by building out our own digital capabilities.

​
Our Strengths 
​
Broad portfolio of globally recognized brands.  In an environment of rapidly changing consumer fashion trends, we benefit from a balanced mix of more than 30 licensed and proprietary brands anchored by our global power brands: DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, which have strong brand equity and long-standing consumer appeal. Our overall brand portfolio includes other complementary brands that are diversified across product categories, price points, demographics, occasions, fits and sizes, and styles and genres. Our proprietary brands include DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, Sonia Rykiel, G.H. Bass, Eliza J, Jessica Howard, Andrew Marc, Marc New York and Wilsons Leather. We are a licensee of choice for well-known brands, consisting of fashion brands including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Levi’s, Guess?, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan, Vince Camuto, Dockers. Beginning in January 2024, we will also sell products under the Nautica brand. We also license team sports oriented brands, including the National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League and over 150 U.S. colleges and universities. We believe that our well-diversified brand portfolio with power brands and complementary brands is well positioned to satisfy ongoing consumer needs and preferences. Additionally, our experience in developing and acquiring licensed brands and proprietary labels, as well as our reputation for producing high quality, well-designed apparel, has led major customers to select us as a partner of choice for their own private label programs.

​
Long-standing relationships forged with retailers and license partners through emphasis on design, sourcing and quality control. We believe our core strengths provide a foundation that drives our partnerships with retailers and licensors. Our in-house design and merchandising teams design substantially all of our licensed, proprietary and private label products, and our designers work closely with our licensors and private label customers to create designs and styles that represent the look they seek to project. We believe that we have developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry as a result of our design capabilities, sourcing expertise, on-time delivery and high standards of quality control. Our service, brand stewardship and industry expertise have allowed us to continue to deliver as a go-to preferred partner for many of our customers.
​
Well-developed supply chain infrastructure is a key core competency that leverages strong vendor relationships developed over the past 40 years. We have long-standing, trust-based relationships with our vendors that form the foundation of our global supply chain that has been built upon over the last 40 years. We have a network of worldwide suppliers that allows us to access the highest quality products, negotiate competitive terms without relying on any single vendor, access new technology and design insights, and enhance our market intelligence. We support and cultivate these relationships by continuously investing management time while also maintaining a physical presence in key jurisdictions. We employ a quality control team and a sourcing group to ensure the quality of our products, as well as local teams that operate on the ground with a hands-on approach and a deep-rooted knowledge base with respect to our manufacturers. By working closely with our global partners on all aspects of the supply chain, we aim to safeguard against potential disruptions. We believe that we have a long-standing competitive advantage with our current supply chain partners and we continue to focus on broadening the breadth and depth of our inventory sourcing capabilities. We continue to focus on methods aimed at bolstering production and devising and implementing strategies to further diversify our production base and expand sourcing capabilities across the globe while leveraging best practices and strong vendor relationships.

Diversified business mix across customers, price points, products, and distribution channels.  We market our products at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution, allowing us to provide products to a broad range of consumers. Our products are sold to approximately 1,700 customers, including a cross section of retailers such as Macy’s, including its Bloomingdale’s division, Dillard’s, Hudson’s Bay Company, including its Saks Fifth Avenue division, Nordstrom, Kohl’s, TJX Companies, Ross Stores and Burlington, as well as membership clubs such as Costco and Sam’s Club. We also sell to leading online retail partners such as Amazon, Fanatics, Zalando and Zappos and have made minority investments in two e-commerce retailers. Our strong relationships with retailers have been established through many years of personal customer service and our objective of meeting or exceeding retailer expectations. In addition, we continue to make changes to our business to address the additional challenges and opportunities created by the evolving role of the online marketplace in the retail sector and expect to expand the sale of our products in an omni-channel environment. As economic conditions waver and consumer trends change, we believe that our deep-rooted relationships across the retail landscape, diversified brands serving all types of consumers and our product portfolio mix that covers all price points allow us to operate on a flexible and advantageous basis.
​
Experienced management team.  Our executive management team has worked together for a significant period of time and has extensive experience in the apparel industry. Morris Goldfarb, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has been with us for over 45 years. Sammy Aaron, our Vice Chairman and President, joined us in 2005 when we acquired Marvin Richards, Neal S. Nackman, our Chief Financial Officer, has been with us for almost 20 years and Jeffrey Goldfarb, our Executive Vice President, has been with us for over 20 years. Our leadership team has demonstrated experience in successfully acquiring, managing, integrating and positioning new businesses having completed ten acquisitions and several joint ventures over the last 20 years, while also adding numerous new licenses and licensed products to our portfolio.
​
Wholesale Operations
​
Licensed Products
​
The sale of licensed products is a key element of our strategy and we have continually expanded our offerings of licensed products for over 25 years. Sales of licensed products accounted for 58.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2023, 67.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and 68.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2021. Net sales of products under the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands constituted approximately 48.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2023 and approximately 50.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2022.
​
In November 2022, we announced the extension of licenses for Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger products. The amendments to the license agreements for these products provide for staggered extensions by category that expire beginning December 31, 2024 and continuing through December 31, 2027. The table below reflects these extensions and also provides similar information for other license agreements.
​
PVH Corp., the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, has indicated that it intends to produce these products itself once the license agreements expire. Unless we are able to increase the sales of our other products, acquire new businesses and/or enter into other license agreements covering different products, the inability to renew the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger license agreements would cause a significant decrease in our net sales and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

In March 2023, we announced the signing of a long-term license with Authentic Brands Group for the Nautica brand in North America. We will produce across a number of categories, starting with jeans then expanding in a phased approach into additional categories including sportswear, suit separates and dresses. The new five-year license agreement, effective beginning in January 2024, includes three extensions, for five years each. First deliveries are expected to hit the floor in January 2024.

​
We have continually sought to increase our portfolio of name brands, product offerings and tiers of distribution because we believe that consumers prefer to buy brands they know and brand owners prefer to engage licensees who have a successful track record of developing brands.
​
Under our license agreements, we are generally required to achieve minimum net sales of licensed products, pay guaranteed minimum royalties, make specified royalty and advertising payments (usually based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products), and receive prior approval of the licensor as to all design and other elements of a product prior to production. License agreements may also restrict our ability to enter into other license agreements for competing products or acquire businesses that produce competing products without the consent of the licensor. If we do not satisfy 

9



any of these requirements or otherwise fail to meet our material obligations under a license agreement, a licensor usually will have the right to terminate our license. License agreements also typically restrict our ability to assign or transfer the agreement without the prior written consent of a licensor and generally provide that a change in control, including as a result of the acquisition of us by another company, is considered to be a transfer of the license agreement that would give a licensor the right to terminate the license unless it has approved the transaction. Our ability to renew a license agreement may be subject to the discretion of the licensor or to attaining minimum sales and/or royalty levels and to our compliance with the provisions of the agreement.
​
Proprietary Brands
​
Dating back to the beginning of our company, G-III has sold apparel under its own proprietary brands. Over the years, we developed or acquired brands such as G-III Sports by Carl Banks, Eliza J and Jessica Howard. We also acquired Andrew Marc, an aspirational luxury outerwear brand, G.H. Bass, a well-known heritage brand, and Vilebrequin, a premier swimwear and resort wear brand. In our most significant acquisition, we acquired Donna Karan International, which owns DKNY and Donna Karan, two of the world’s most iconic and recognizable power brands. In October 2021, we acquired European luxury fashion brand Sonia Rykiel and in May 2022, we acquired the remaining interests that we did not own in the iconic Karl Lagerfeld fashion brand. We currently design, manufacture, distribute and sell products under our own proprietary brands, as well as license our proprietary brands in a variety of categories. We continue to seek new licensing opportunities to broaden the reach of these brands. 
​
DKNY and Donna Karan
​
We own two of the world’s most iconic fashion brands: DKNY and Donna Karan. First launched in 1984, DKNY and Donna Karan design, source, market, retail and distribute collections of women’s and men’s clothing, sportswear, handbags, accessories and shoes under the DKNY and Donna Karan brand names.
​
Based on DKNY’s and Donna Karan’s significant brand equity, we believe there are opportunities to expand existing categories, launch new initiatives and develop an even stronger licensing and distribution base. We believe that both the DKNY and Donna Karan brands have the potential for significant growth. In addition, we expect increased revenues from licensing and from sales growth across many categories of the business.
​
After acquiring the brands in December 2016, we initially focused on re-positioning and re-launching the DKNY brand. Our DKNY products are designed to provide a total wardrobe for a woman’s active, modern lifestyle. Products developed reflect the DNA of the DKNY brand and emphasize a strong price-value relationship. We believe that DKNY is a premier fashion and lifestyle brand. DKNY products produced by us or by our various licensees are sold through department stores, specialty retailers and online retailers worldwide, as well as through company-operated retail stores, digital sites and international brand partners and distributors. 
​
We believe that the Donna Karan brand also offers significant growth potential. Donna Karan has been a small business for us to date. We are now focused on the re-positioning and expansion of the brand for Spring 2024. The new Donna Karan will be a modern system of dressing created to appeal to a woman’s senses on every level, addressing the full lifestyle needs of a new consumer. Donna Karan product is expected to be distributed in better department stores, digital channels and our own Donna Karan website in North America and internationally. Donna Karan is widely considered a top fashion brand and is recognized as one of the most famous designer names in American fashion. We believe this indicates that consumer demand exists for the brand. We believe that the strength of the Donna Karan brand, along with our success with the DKNY brand, demonstrates the potential for our new Donna Karan products.
​
We believe there are significant opportunities to enhance the digital business of DKNY and Donna Karan, prudently manage the retail store base for DKNY over the long term and capitalize on our industry relationships in seeking premium placement for DKNY and Donna Karan product categories in department and other retail stores globally.

Karl Lagerfeld
​
In May 2022, we acquired the remaining interests in the Karl Lagerfeld fashion brand that we did not own. The addition of the Karl Lagerfeld fashion brand to the G-III portfolio of owned brands advances several of our strategic initiatives, including increasing the direct ownership of brands, capitalizing on their licensing opportunities and further diversifying our global presence. This acquisition represents a significant opportunity to expand our international growth by further developing our European-based brands which also include Vilebrequin and Sonia Rykiel. We believe that Karl Lagerfeld’s existing digital channel presence could enable us to enhance our omni-channel business and further accelerate our digital initiatives. The influential legacy of the Karl Lagerfeld brand embodies a creative expression that aligns with our goal to provide innovative products for our customers.
​
The iconic Karl Lagerfeld brand is known for its signature aesthetic combining Parisian classics with a rock-chic attitude and tailored silhouettes. Its portfolio of accessible, aspirational collections includes ready-to-wear apparel for women, men and children, as well as handbags and small leather goods. Licensed collections include watches, eyewear, footwear, perfumes, candles and fashion jewelry. As of January 31, 2023, Karl Lagerfeld products are distributed through more than 200 stores worldwide, including 62 company-operated stores, located primarily internationally and through digital channels. In addition, Karl Lagerfeld is distributed through a premium wholesale distribution network in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
​
Vilebrequin
​
Vilebrequin is a premier provider of status swimwear, resort wear and related accessories. Vilebrequin products are sold in over 100 countries around the world. We believe that Vilebrequin has the potential to significantly develop its distribution network worldwide and expand its product offerings. A majority of Vilebrequin’s current revenues are derived from sales in Europe and the United States. As of January 31, 2023, Vilebrequin products were distributed through select wholesale distribution, 97 company-operated stores and 87 licensed stores, located internationally and in the United States, as well as digitally on our websites.
​
Vilebrequin’s iconic designs and reputation are linked to its French Riviera heritage arising from its founding in St. Tropez over forty years ago. Vilebrequin’s men’s swimwear, which accounts for the majority of its sales, is known for its exclusive prints, wide range of colors, attention to detail, fabric quality and well-designed cuts. In addition to men’s swimwear, Vilebrequin sells a collection of women’s swimwear, children’s swimwear, men’s resort wear, women’s resort wear, children’s resort wear and related accessories including hats, beach bags, beach towels, shoes, sunglasses, watches and pool floats. We believe that Vilebrequin is a powerful brand. We plan to continue adding more company operated and franchised retail locations and increase our wholesale distribution of Vilebrequin products throughout the world.
​
In September 2022, Vilebrequin acquired a beach concession in Cannes, and plans to open the first Vilebrequin Beach club at this location in the spring of 2023. Ideally located on the French Riviera, this first Vilebrequin Beach club is expected to further expand our brand awareness. Vilebrequin also opened a branded beach cabana club at the Boca Raton Hotel. We expect to continue to expand with store openings in global key markets and reinforce the luxury status of Vilebrequin with immersive brand experiences.
​
Sonia Rykiel
​
In October 2021, we purchased European luxury fashion brand Sonia Rykiel. Sonia Rykiel, who created this well-known brand, was one of the leading figures of Parisian fashion. We relaunched the brand in the fall of 2022 with the opening of retail stores in Paris, New York and Monaco, and plan to expand further into Europe and other regions in 2023. We believe this purchase will enable us to expand into the luxury space and increase our international presence. We also believe that there is untapped potential for this brand.
​
Licensing of Proprietary Brands
As our portfolio of propriety brands has grown, we have licensed these brands in new categories. We began licensing Andrew Marc, Vilebrequin, Sonia Rykiel and G.H. Bass in selected categories after acquiring these brands. Our licensing 

11



program has significantly increased as a result of owning the DKNY, Donna Karan and Karl Lagerfeld brands. We currently license our proprietary brands in a variety of categories and continue to seek new licensing opportunities to broaden the reach of these brands.
​
We have strong relationships with category leading license partners, including, but not limited to, Fossil, Marchon, Komar and Inter Parfums. The DKNY and Donna Karan brands have worldwide license agreements for a broad array of products including fragrance, intimates, eyewear, bedding and bath products and women’s sleepwear and loungewear. Additionally, we license the DKNY brand in the United States and internationally for children’s clothing, children’s footwear, men’s and women’s watches, jewelry, men’s tailored clothing, men’s sportswear, men’s dress shirts, men’s underwear, men’s loungewear, men’s swimwear, men’s and women’s golfwear, men’s and women’s socks, and furniture. 
​
In September 2021, we entered into a long-term global licensing agreement with Inter Parfums, Inc. for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances and fragrance-related products under the DKNY and Donna Karan brands. Inter Parfums, Inc. became the exclusive licensee for these products effective July 1, 2022 with the initial term of the license extending through December 31, 2032. We believe the fragrance category enables our brands to connect more broadly with global consumers. 
​
We intend to continue to focus on expanding licensing opportunities for the DKNY and Donna Karan brands. We believe that we can capitalize on significant, untapped global licensing potential for these brands in a number of categories and we intend to grow royalty streams by expanding existing licenses, as well as through new categories with new licensees.
​
We license the Karl Lagerfeld brand for a wide range of product categories including, but not limited to, footwear, men’s apparel, ready to wear fashions, fragrances, children’s clothing, and eyewear.
​
We license the G.H. Bass brand in the United States and internationally for men’s, women’s and children’s footwear, children’s clothing, men’s denim, men’s underwear and loungewear, and bedding and bath products and the Andrew Marc brand in North America for men’s and boy’s tailored clothing and men’s and women’s denim
​
Retail Operations 
​
As of January 31, 2023, our retail operations segment consisted of 59 stores operated under our DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris brands, as well as digital channels for the DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc and Wilsons Leather businesses.
​
Our DKNY stores offer a large range of products including sportswear, dresses, outerwear, handbags, footwear and athleisure apparel. Our Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores offer a range of products including sportswear, dresses, outerwear, handbags and footwear. 
​
As digital sales of apparel continue to increase, we are developing additional digital marketing initiatives on our websites and through social media. We are investing in digital personnel, marketing, logistics, planning, distribution and other strategic opportunities to expand our digital footprint. Our digital business for our retail operations segment consists of our own web platforms at www.dkny.com, www.donnakaran.com, www.karllagerfeldparis.com, www.ghbass.com, www.andrewmarc.com and www.wilsonsleather.com. Our digital business also includes our own web platforms at www.vilebrequin.com, www.soniarykiel.com and www.karl.com which are part of our wholesale operations segment.
​
We sell our products over the web through retail partners such as macys.com, nordstrom.com and dillards.com, each of which has a substantial online business. In addition, we sell to leading pure online retail partners such as Amazon, Fanatics, Zalando and Zappos and have made minority investments in two e-commerce retailers.
​
Products — Development and Design
​
G-III designs, sources and markets women’s and men’s apparel at a wide range of retail price points. Our product offerings primarily include outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women’s suits and women’s performance wear. We also market footwear and accessories including women’s handbags, small leather goods, cold weather accessories, and luggage.
​

12



G-III’s licensed apparel consists of both women’s and men’s products in a broad range of categories. See “Wholesale Operations — Licensed Products” above. We seek licenses that will enable us to offer a range of products targeting different price points and different distribution channels. We also offer a wide range of products under our own proprietary brands.
​
We work with a diversified group of retailers, such as Macy’s, Harley-Davidson, Costco, Kohl’s and Ross Stores in developing product lines that are sold under their private label programs. Our design teams collaborate with our customers to produce custom-made products for their stores. Store buyers may provide samples to us or may select styles already available in our showrooms. We believe we have established a reputation among these buyers for our ability to produce high quality product on a reliable, expeditious and cost-effective basis.
​
Our in-house designers are responsible for the design and look of our licensed, proprietary and private label products. We work closely with our licensors to create designs and styles for each of our licensed brands. Licensors generally must approve products to be sold under their brand names prior to production. We maintain a global pulse on styles, using trend services and color services to enable us to quickly respond to style changes in the apparel industry. Our experienced design personnel and our focused use of outside services enable us to incorporate current trends and consumer preferences in designing new products and styles.
​
Our design personnel meet regularly with our sales and merchandising departments, as well as with the design and merchandising staffs of our licensors, to review market trends, sales results and the popularity of our latest products. Our designers present their evaluation of the styles expected to be in demand in the United States. We also seek input from selected customers with respect to product design. We believe that our sensitivity to the needs of retailers, coupled with the flexibility of our production capabilities and our continual monitoring of the retail market, enables us to modify designs and order specifications in a timely fashion.
​
Manufacturing and Sourcing
​
G-III’s wholesale operations and retail operations segments arrange for the production of products from independent manufacturers located primarily in Vietnam, China, Indonesia and, to a lesser extent, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Jordan, Egypt and India. Vilebrequin’s products are manufactured primarily in Bulgaria, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, Italy and China. Karl Lagerfeld’s products are manufactured primarily in China, Portugal, Turkey and India. A small portion of our garments are manufactured in the United States.
​
We currently have representative offices in Hangzhou, Nanjing and Dongguan, China, as well as in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Jordan. These offices act as our liaison with manufacturers in the Far East. G-III’s headquarters provides these liaison offices with production orders stating the quantity, quality, delivery time and types of garments to be produced. The personnel in our liaison offices assist in the negotiation and placement of orders with manufacturers. In allocating production among independent suppliers, we consider a number of criteria, including, but not limited to, compliance, quality, availability of production capacity, pricing and ability to meet changing production requirements.
​
To facilitate better service for our customers and accommodate the volume of manufacturing in the Far East, we also have a subsidiary in Hong Kong. Our Hong Kong subsidiary supports third party production of products on an agency fee basis and acts as an agent for substantially all of our production. Our China and Hong Kong offices monitor production at manufacturers’ facilities to ensure quality control, compliance with our specifications and timely delivery of finished garments to our distribution facilities and, in some cases, direct to our customers. 
​
In connection with the foreign manufacture of our products, manufacturers purchase raw materials including fabric, wool, leather and other submaterials (such as linings, zippers, buttons and trim) at our direction. Prior to commencing the manufacture of products, samples of raw materials or submaterials are sent to us for approval. We regularly inspect and supervise the manufacture of our products in order to ensure timely delivery, maintain quality control and monitor compliance with our manufacturing specifications. We also inspect finished products at the factory site.
​

13



We generally arrange for the production of products on a purchase order basis with completed products manufactured to our design specifications. We assume the risk of loss predominantly on a Freight-On-Board (F.O.B.) basis when goods are delivered to a shipper and are insured against casualty losses arising during shipping.
​
As is customary, we have not entered into any long-term contractual arrangements with any contractor or manufacturer. We believe that the production capacity of foreign manufacturers with which we have developed, or are developing, a relationship is adequate to meet our production requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that alternative foreign manufacturers are readily available.
​
A majority of all finished goods manufactured for us is shipped to our distribution facilities or to designated third party facilities for final inspection, allocation, and reshipment to customers. The goods are delivered to our customers and us by independent shippers. We choose the form of shipment (principally ship, truck or air) based upon a customer’s needs, cost and timing considerations.
​
Vendor Code of Conduct
​
We are committed to ethical and responsible conduct in all of our operations and respect for the rights of all individuals. We strive to ensure that human rights are upheld for all workers involved in our supply chain, and that individuals experience safe, fair and non-discriminatory working conditions. In addition, we are committed to compliance with applicable environmental requirements and are committed to seeing that all of our products are manufactured and distributed in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We expect that our business partners will share these commitments, which we enforce through our Vendor Code of Conduct. Our Vendor Code of Conduct specifically requires our manufacturers to not use child, forced or involuntary labor and to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We provide training and guidance to the factories our contractors use related to our Vendor Code of Conduct and the applicable laws in the country in which the factory is located. The training provides the factories with a more in-depth explanation of our Vendor Code of Conduct. In addition to their contractual obligations, we evaluate our suppliers' compliance with our Vendor Code of Conduct through audits conducted both by our employees and third-party compliance auditing firms.
​
Human Capital
​
Our People
​
As of January 31, 2023, we employed approximately 3,600 persons on a full-time basis and approximately 1,100 on a part-time basis. We employ both union and non-union personnel and believe that our relations with our employees are good. We have not experienced any interruption of our operations due to a labor disagreement with our employees.
​
We are an Equal Opportunity Employer with policies, procedures and practices that recognize the value and worth of each individual, covering matters such as safety, training, advancement, discrimination, harassment and retaliation. We provide training on important issues to our personnel. G-III ensures compliance with labor and employment law issues through a variety of processes and procedures, using both internal and external expertise and resources. We continue to work towards achieving a stronger, more engaging workplace coupled with a foundation for enhancing the employee experience by continuing to promote our passion for our product, pride in our partnerships, our accountability and our entrepreneurial spirit.
​
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees and customers and have taken extra care to protect them throughout the fluid nature of the pandemic with responsive workplace policies and procedures. 
​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
​
We are a diverse workplace and know that, to succeed, we must become an even more diverse, equitable and inclusive organization. Currently, over 40% of our leadership team and 71% of our overall workforce self-identify as women, and 48% of our overall workforce identify as Black, Indigenous and People of Color (“BIPOC”). Of our twelve Board members, there are four women and four people of diverse backgrounds, exceeding NASDAQ requirements for board 

14



diversity. We recognize that insights and ideas from a diverse range of backgrounds will better position us for the future and continue to work towards increasing Board diversity.
​
Our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion also extends outside of our business. We are a founding member of the groundbreaking Social Justice Center at the Fashion Institute of Technology (“FIT”), a premier fashion university, whose purpose is to help establish a program that is intended to increase opportunities and accelerate social equity for BIPOC persons entering our industry for years to come. Additionally, we continued our partnership with UNCF (“United Negro College Fund”) by sponsoring four enriching and rewarding student internships. These interns were provided room and board at FIT. They participated in a program that consisted of educational master class sessions and experienced New York theatre and other local programs. In fiscal 2023, we will continue to support UNCF by providing students the opportunity to gain firsthand experience working at G-III.
​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are at the heart of G-III’s values. We strive to create a workplace with opportunities for all. We have made progress and intend to continue to do so in the coming years.
​
Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention
​
Having the right talent in the organization is one of the most critical aspects of our business. This year we grew our HR team to enhance opportunities focused on hiring, developing and retaining talent. We invested in new HR systems that will enhance the recruitment process and facilitate compliance with the continuously changing landscape of employment law. We also introduced a Lunch and Learn program facilitated by our leadership team for employees that has provided an opportunity for continuous learning about our business. We are planning to introduce a G-III Master Class training library in fiscal 2024 that will make these sessions and other educational tools accessible to our employees.
​
Through our aggressive recruiting, we have been able to bring in best-in-class talent. We had several key hires at the Company, including a new head of digital, who is building a new team to accelerate the development of our digital business. Additionally, we welcomed a new President of Donna Karan/DKNY Europe situated in our Milan office who will continue to develop our expanding reach in Europe. 
​
Compensation, Benefits, Safety and Wellness
​
We expanded our comprehensive health and retirement benefits to eligible employees this year, most notably, with the introduction of Aetna Inc. for our health plans and Fidelity Investments for our 401(k) plan. We also introduced and sponsored paid subscriptions to Headspace and Noom, smartphone applications that offer dedicated tools to support employee wellness.
​
Corporate Social Responsibility
​
We spend significant time implementing our key initiatives, developing programs and furthering our Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) agenda.
​

● | Engage Our People – Embodying our spirit of agility and entrepreneurism, in fiscal 2023 our teams continued to build on the success we achieved in fiscal 2022 as we ensured that business was conducted despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With teams back in the office fulltime, we began developing and executing several team building activities to bring people together such as our Lunch and Learn program. We also further engaged our supply chain partners to improve their employment practices and positively impact the workforce within our supply chain.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We understand that the success of our supply chain is critical to our future and we have taken important steps to improve it. We joined the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (“SAC”) which works to reduce the social and environmental impact of apparel, footwear and textile production around the world by employing the Higg Factory Evaluation Module (“FEM”) which is an environmental assessment of supply chain factories shared among brands and industries. SAC has annual requirements and goals for its members to meet to keep the industry moving towards greater sustainability. Engaging our supply chain partners to participate in SAC is intended to 

15



result in more factories completing environmental and social assessments that are shared across the industry. This promotes standardized measurement for products and the supply chain and reduces redundancies among brands and factories performing audits of their sustainability practices.
​
We have continued to focus on the forced labor issues facing our industry and have reviewed our relationships in an attempt to protect against the use of forced labor in our supply chain. We formalized an internal cotton traceability program to further mitigate the risk of forced labor being used to produce product for us. This program includes enhancements to management systems, training, and tracking tools across our supply chain. To further bolster our programs against this risk, we engaged ORITAINTM, a third-party that uses forensic technology to trace materials back to their fiber origins. This traceability is essential to mitigating the risk that forced labor is used throughout the supply chain. We routinely engage with counsel and industry organizations with respect to regulatory developments to ensure our practices and procedures are aligning with the continually developing regulatory landscape. Combined with ORITAINTM’s technology and our internal management systems, we are working to mitigate these global supply chain risks. Additionally, with ORITAINTM’s help, we have begun exploring technology partners that can support us with tracing and tracking our total material usage. Taken together, we believe we have developed a strong approach and intend to continue to refine our oversight of our supply chain.
​

● | Protect Our Environment – We continue to work towards reducing our environmental impact by enacting sustainable fashion practices. We are working on determining our Scope 1 and Scope 2 baseline greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions for 2022 reporting based on the proposed rules set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2022. Using this baseline, we intend to set strategic goals for reducing our GHG emissions from both a short-term and long-term perspective. We have engaged an industry-leading environmental consultancy to support our understanding our of GHG emissions and assist us in developing best practices to support our goal of reducing our environmental impact. Our focus includes (i) understanding the environmental impact made by our choices and how we can reduce those impacts in thoughtful and strategic ways without disrupting our business and (ii) fostering a culture of environmental understanding and accountability in all that we do.

​
We are making progress on our goal to use 100% recycled materials for all synthetic fibers by 2030 by working to set goals for adoption of more sustainable materials. We are exploring potential technology solutions to help us reach our goals. 
​
Invest in Our Communities – G-III has a longstanding commitment to philanthropy and supporting communities in which we live and serve. We continue to maximize opportunities to give to and engage with our charitable partners. We are involved with various charitable organizations including Ronald McDonald House, Women In Need (“WIN”), UNCF, Delivering Good, Hetrick Martin Institute and City Harvest, in addition to supporting the new Social Justice Center at the Fashion Institute of Technology. We have also partnered with new programs to provide aid to people impacted by current events. This year, we supported the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis financially and through in-kind donations of our products. We also established a new internal committee, comprised of our employees, who are actively involved in developing and executing charitable initiatives across the organization. This committee has already strengthened our involvement with our charitable partners in new ways. G-III is committed to continuing its mission to help others in the community through corporate and employee donations and volunteerism.
​
Our work with our new consultants is expected to bring about greater change in this coming year as we continue to make progress on our core CSR principles: Engage Our People, Protect Our Environment and Invest in Our Community. They represent a commitment to the greater good and our role in the global community.
​
Customs and Trade Issues
​
Our arrangements with textile manufacturers and suppliers are subject to requisite customs clearances for products and the imposition of export duties. Customs duties on our products presently range from duty free to 37.5%, depending upon the 

16



product, composition, construction, country of origin and country of import. A substantial majority of our product is imported into the United States and, to a lesser extent, into Canada and Europe. Countries in which our products are sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges or other import controls or restrictions or adjust prevailing duty or tariff levels. Any action by the executive branch of the United States government to increase tariffs on imported goods, such as the imposition of tariffs on goods manufactured in China, could adversely affect our business. 
​
Under the provisions of the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) agreement governing international trade in textiles, known as the “WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing,” the United States and other WTO member countries have eliminated quotas on textiles and apparel-related products from WTO member countries. As a result, quota restrictions generally do not affect our business in most countries. 
​
Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to regulations that relate to product labeling, content and safety requirements, licensing requirements and flammability testing. We believe that we are in compliance with those regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment.
​
Marketing and Distribution
​
G-III’s products are sold primarily to department, specialty and mass merchant retail stores in the United States. We sell to approximately 1,700 customers, ranging from national and regional chains to small specialty stores. We also distribute our products through our retail stores and through digital channels for the DKNY, Donna Karan, G.H. Bass, Vilebrequin, Andrew Marc, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, Wilsons Leather and Sonia Rykiel businesses, as well as the digital channels of our retail partners such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, Amazon, Fanatics, Zalando and Zappos.
​
Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 74.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2023, 78.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and 73.3% of our net sales in fiscal 2021. Sales to Macy’s, which includes sales to its Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s store chains, as well as through macys.com, accounted for an aggregate of 21.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2023, 23.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and 20.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2021. In addition, sales to TJX Companies accounted for an aggregate of 15.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2023, 14.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and 12.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2021. The loss of any of these customers or a significant reduction in purchases by our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
​
A substantial majority of our sales are made in the United States. We also sell our products to customers in Europe, Canada, the Far East, the Middle East, Central America, South America and Australia, which, on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 19.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2023, 14.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and 14.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2021. 
​
Our products are sold primarily through our direct sales force along with our principal executives who are also actively involved in the sale of our products. Some of our products are also sold by independent sales representatives located throughout the United States. The Canadian market is serviced by a sales and customer service team based both in the United States and in Canada. Sales outside of the United States and Canada may be managed by our salespeople located in our sales offices in Europe or Asia depending on the customer. Vilebrequin products are sold through a direct sales force primarily located across Europe.
​
Brand name products sold by us pursuant to a license agreement are promoted by institutional and product advertisements placed by the licensor. Our license agreements generally require us to pay the licensor a fee, based on a percentage of net sales of licensed product, to pay for a portion of these advertising costs. We may also be required to spend a specified percentage of net sales of a licensed product on advertising placed by us.
​
Our marketing and press efforts on behalf of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands are highly focused around communicating brand DNA and visual identity for the new evolution of DKNY and Donna Karan. We are re-building the brand image through high impact ad campaigns that feature socially relevant talent. We are striving to create noteworthy marketing initiatives, collaborations and image programs to build brand awareness and bring in a new young customer. Donna Karan and DKNY will continue to support global licensees with brand campaigns and product images to tell the 

17



brand story. We continue to invest in digital media and storytelling for brand amplification and to establish comprehensive commercial marketing tools that will support our global wholesale and retail channels. 
​
Karl Lagerfeld’s marketing efforts are inspired by Karl Lagerfeld’s own mantra: “embrace the present and invent the future.” We continuously seek to share relevant and engaging content, with a focus on digital content. Inspired by Karl Lagerfeld’s own passion for collaboration, we regularly foster partnerships with top tier tastemakers and icons. Our campaigns for the Karl Lagerfeld brand are intended to grow awareness across our retail, digital, wholesale and franchise channels. In North America, the Karl Lagerfeld Paris brand further amplifies this vision through locally-relevant brand engagement. 
​
We are planning a large-scale marketing campaign including the launch of special products, collaboration with celebrities and the creation of content for our website and social media channels. Our retail partners around the world are hosting events, pop-up shops and dedicating store windows to Karl Lagerfeld. In Spring 2023, Vogue’s Met Gala, along with the museum’s summer exhibition, will pay tribute to the life and work of Karl Lagerfeld. This event is expected to create extensive global news and social media coverage and significantly benefit Karl Lagerfeld’s global brand recognition. We believe these efforts will be the most significant moment for the brand to date and we expect them to drive awareness, interest and sales in the Karl Lagerfeld and Karl Lagerfeld Paris brands. 
​
Vilebrequin’s marketing efforts have been based on continually offering new swimwear prints and expanding the range of its products to new categories such as women’s swimwear, ready-to-wear and accessories. Besides its traditional advertising networks (print and outdoor advertising), Vilebrequin is seeking to develop new marketing channels through the use of digital media, product placement, impactful collaborations and public relations. Through the growth of its network of stores, distributors and franchisees, Vilebrequin is seeking to reinforce its position in its traditional markets, such as the United States, Europe and the Middle East, and to develop new markets in Asia. 
​
We believe we have developed awareness of our other owned labels primarily through our reputation, consumer acceptance and the fashion press. We primarily rely on our reputation and relationships to generate business in the private label portion of our wholesale operations segment. We believe we have developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry as a result of, among other things, our standards of quality control, on-time delivery, competitive pricing and willingness and ability to assist customers in their merchandising of our products.
​
As digital sales of apparel continue to increase, we are developing initiatives to increase our digital presence through our own websites and through the websites of our retail partners. We are working closely with our retail partners to provide consumers with a high quality viewing experience for our products. We are also working to increase our digital sales through marketing, social influencers and other online drivers of sales.
​
Seasonality
​
Retail sales of apparel have traditionally been seasonal in nature. Historically, our wholesale business has been dependent on our sales during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Net sales during the third and fourth quarters accounted for approximately 60% of our net sales in fiscal 2023, 64% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and 66% of our net sales in fiscal 2021. We are highly dependent on our results of operations during the second half of our fiscal year. The second half of the year is expected to continue to provide a larger amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our net income for the foreseeable future.
​
Trademarks
​
We own some of the trademarks used by us in connection with our wholesale operations segment, as well as almost all of the trademarks used in our retail operations segment. We act as licensee of certain trademarks owned by third parties that are used in connection with our business. The principal brands that we license are summarized under the heading “Wholesale Operations – Licensed Products” above. We own a number of proprietary brands that we use in connection with our business and products including, among others, DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Eliza J, Jessica Howard, Wilsons Leather, Sonia Rykiel and G-III Sports by Carl Banks. 

18



We have registered, or applied for registration of, many of our trademarks in multiple jurisdictions for use on a variety of apparel and related other products.
​
In markets outside of the United States, our rights to some of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our attempt to expand into foreign markets, we may experience conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks that would impede our use and registration of some of our trademarks. Such conflicts may arise from time to time as we pursue international expansion. Although we have not in the past suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets or in new product categories, we cannot be sure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional brands to new markets.
​
We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that they have value in the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights against infringement.
