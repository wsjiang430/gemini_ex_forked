Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We are a medical device company focused on the design, development and commercialization of novel technologies for use by people with diabetes and prediabetes. We are currently developing two products; a non-invasive glucose monitor for use by those with Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes, and an implantable continuous glucose monitor for those with Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes.
 
We were incorporated in Delaware in May 2010 as Integrity Applications, Inc. In July 2010, we completed a reverse triangular merger with Integrity Israel and Integrity Acquisition Corp. Ltd., an Israeli corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, pursuant to which Integrity Acquisition Corp. Ltd. merged with and into Integrity Israel (the “Reorganization”). As a result of the Reorganization, Integrity Israel became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. Until recently, we operated primarily through Integrity Israel and moved our operations primarily to the US in 2022.
 
In connection with our application to list our shares on Nasdaq Capital Market (“NASDAQ”), on August 13, 2021, we effected a reverse split of our Common Stock in a ratio of 1 for 13 (the “Reverse Share Split”). For accounting purposes, all Shares, options and warrants to purchase Common Stock and loss per share amounts have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to this Reverse Share Split for all periods presented in these interim consolidated financial statements. Any fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Share Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share.
 
On December 8, 2021 our shares of Common Stock were approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“NASDAQ”) and trading on NASDAQ commenced on December 10, 2021 under the trading symbol, IGAP.
 
On March 14, 2022, we completed our corporate name change to GlucoTrack, Inc., and ticker symbol change to GCTK.
 
The Company was founded with a mission to develop GlucoTrack®, a noninvasive glucose monitoring device designed to help people with diabetes and pre-diabetics obtain glucose level readings without the pain, inconvenience, cost and difficulty of conventional (invasive) spot finger stick devices. The first generation GlucoTrack (“GlucoTrack 1.0”), which successfully received CE Mark approval and ISO certifications, utilized a combination of ultrasound, electromagnetic and thermal technologies to obtain glucose measurements in approximately one minute via a small sensor that is clipped onto one’s earlobe and connected to a small, handheld control and display unit, all without drawing blood or interstitial fluid. After a limited release beta test in Europe and the Middle East, the Company determined that it would focus on developing its next generation non-invasive monitor (“GlucoTrack 2.0”), and we have since withdrawn our CE Mark and ISO certifications for GlucoTrack 1.0.
 
We are currently developing GlucoTrack 2.0. The current clinical prototype utilizes ultrasound-only sensor technology, reduces the overall cost and complexity of the device, and reduces the measurement time from approximately sixty seconds to less than two seconds. Initial testing has produced promising results, suggesting measurement accuracies could be relatively comparable with those of conventional, already in-the-market CGM technologies. We expect to begin our first-in-human (FIH) study in the second quarter of 2023. Collecting data for sensor characterization and algorithm development will be the primary goals of the FIH study. The results of this study will also drive the development of the commercial version of the device, which is expected to commence late in the third quarter of 2023. Once the development of the commercial device version is complete, we intend to conduct a scaled down version of the FDA pivotal trial to resolve any lingering device performance or human factors issues prior to executing the larger pivotal trial for FDA submission.

Following the acquisition of certain IP  in the fourth quarter of 2022, we are also developing an implantable continuous glucose monitor for use by Type 1 diabetes patients as well as insulin-dependent Type 2 patients. Implant longevity is key to the success of such a device, and we are currently in the feasibility phase to demonstrate the potential of a multi-year implant life. We intend to complete the feasibility study in the second quarter of 2023. We believe our technology, if successful, has the potential to be more accurate, more convenient and have a longer duration than other implantable glucose monitors that are either in the market or currently under development.
 
We are currently developing our own companion applications and a cloud-based solutions to offer an effective platform to provide real time, data driven personalized tools to effectively help a user manage their diabetes, which will be utilized during the clinical trials. In addition to being a critical and effective management tool for the end user, we believe that third parties such as insurers, pharmaceutical companies and advertisers would be willing to pay for the de-identified data that we will obtain through our platform, and that this is an opportunity for us to develop an additional revenue source.
 
After a home-based short calibration process of approximately thirty minutes consisting of three typical blood glucose reference measurements, GlucoTrack 1.0 can be used to non-invasively measure glucose levels for six months before a user is required to repeat the calibration process. The entire calibration process can be performed by the user themselves without the need for a trained calibrator. We believe the simple-to-perform calibration, as well as the infrequency of the required re-calibration are significant advantages over our competition.

Market Opportunity
 
Diabetes
 
Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. Diabetes is caused by the body’s inability to produce or effectively utilize the hormone insulin. This inability prevents the body from adequately regulating blood glucose levels. Glucose, the primary source of energy for cells, must be maintained at certain concentrations in the blood in order to permit optimal cell function and health. Normally, the pancreas provides control of blood glucose levels by secreting the hormone insulin to decrease blood glucose levels when concentrations are too high. In people with diabetes, blood glucose levels fluctuate between very high levels, a condition known as hyperglycemia, and very low levels, a condition known as hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia can lead to serious long-term complications, such as blindness, kidney disease, nervous system disease, amputations, stroke and cardiovascular disease. Hypoglycemia can lead to confusion, loss of consciousness or death.
 
Diabetes is typically classified into two major groups: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the body’s inability to produce insulin, resulting from destruction of the insulin producing cells of the pancreas. Individuals with Type 1 diabetes must rely on frequent insulin injections in order to regulate and maintain blood glucose levels. Type 1 diabetes is frequently diagnosed during childhood or adolescence, although disease onset can occur at any age. Type 2 diabetes, the more common form of diabetes, is characterized by the body’s inability to either properly utilize insulin or produce enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age, obesity, family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose metabolism, physical inactivity and race or ethnicity. Depending on the severity of Type 2 diabetes, individuals may require diet and nutrition management, exercise, oral medications or insulin injections to regulate blood glucose levels.

According to the Diabetes Atlas (Ninth Edition) published by the International Diabetes Federation in 2021, approximately 537 million adults worldwide, between the ages of 20 and 79, or approximately 10% of the world’s adult population, were estimated to suffer from diabetes in 2021 (not including those persons who suffer from impaired glucose tolerance or gestational diabetes, diabetic conditions first arising during pregnancy). The International Diabetes Federation estimates that this number will grow to approximately 784 million adults worldwide by 2045.


Glucose Monitoring
 
Blood glucose levels can be affected by many factors, including the carbohydrate and fat content of meals, exercise, stress, illness or impending illness, hormonal releases, medications, variability in insulin absorption and changes in the effects of insulin in the body. Given the many factors that affect blood glucose levels, maintaining glucose within a normal range can be difficult. Diabetics generally manage their blood glucose levels by administering insulin or ingesting carbohydrates throughout the day to maintain blood glucose within normal ranges. Normal ranges in diabetics vary from person to person. In order to maintain blood glucose levels within normal ranges, diabetics must first measure their blood glucose levels so that they can make the proper therapeutic adjustments. As adjustments are made, additional blood glucose measurements may be necessary to gauge the individual’s response to the adjustments. More frequent testing of blood glucose levels provides patients with information that can be used to better understand and manage their diabetes. Testing of blood glucose levels is usually done before meals, after meals and before going to sleep. Diabetics who take insulin usually need to test more often than those who do not take insulin.
 
Clinical data supports the recommendation that frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels is an important component of effective diabetes management. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial1, consisting of patients with Type 2 diabetes, and the 1993 UK Prospective Diabetes Study2, consisting of patients with Type 2 diabetes, demonstrated that patients who intensely managed blood glucose levels delayed the onset and slowed the progression of diabetes-related complications. In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a major component of intensive management was monitoring blood glucose levels at least four times per day using conventional spot finger stick blood glucose meters. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial demonstrated that intensive management reduced the risk of complications by 76% for eye disease, 60% for nerve disease and 50% for kidney disease. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of over 25 prospective studies concluded that chronic hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes is associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes independently from other conventional risk factors.3 However, despite the evidence that intensive glucose management reduces the long-term complications associated with diabetes, Karter et al. reported in the 2000 issue of Diabetes Care that 67% of people with type 2 diabetes fail to routinely monitor their glucose levels.4
 
Spot finger stick devices are the most prevalent devices for blood glucose monitoring. These devices require users to insert a strip into a glucose meter, take a blood sample with a finger stick and place a drop of blood on a test strip that yields a single point in time blood glucose measurement. Despite continued developments in the field of blood glucose monitors, the routine measurement of glucose levels remains invasive, painful, inconvenient, difficult and costly. This has resulted in a sub-optimal and irregular measurement regimen for many diabetics.

The FDA has approved continuous glucose monitoring system (“CGMS”) devices for blood glucose monitoring, when prescribed by a doctor. CGMS devices use sensors inserted under the skin to check glucose levels in interstitial fluid. The sensor stays in place for up to fourteen days and then must be replaced. A transmitter sends information about glucose levels via radio waves from the sensor to a pager-like wireless monitor. 
 
The FDA has previously approved a single non-invasive product for glucose trend analysis, the GlucoWatch®, so long as the device was used with conventional finger stick glucose monitoring devices. However, the device is no longer available commercially. We are not aware of any other devices that have been approved for use in either the United Stated or the EU for spot or continuous non-invasive blood glucose measurement.
 
We believe that a significant market opportunity exists for our devices which could greatly increase compliance with blood glucose measurement recommendations and help many suffering from diabetes better manage their disease, providing significant benefits to both patients and payors.


Our Products
 
Our first generation GlucoTrack (“GlucoTrack 1.0”), which successfully received CE Mark approval and ISO certifications, utilized a combination of ultrasound, electromagnetic and thermal technologies to obtain glucose measurements in approximately one minute via a small sensor that is clipped onto one’s earlobe and connected to a small, handheld control and display unit, all without drawing blood or interstitial fluid. After a limited release beta test in Europe and the Middle East, the Company determined that it would focus on developing its next generation non-invasive monitor (“GlucoTrack 2.0”), and we have since withdrawn our CE Mark and ISO certifications for GlucoTrack 1.0.
 
We are currently in the development phase of GlucoTrack 2.0. Our development team began our Glucotrack 2.0 redesign program as a project to miniaturize the Glucotrack 1.0 technology into a smaller wireless ear clip that would connect to a smartphone via Bluetooth. As our miniaturization project progressed, the glucose sensing landscape evolved as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices in the market reached similar accuracy as the conventional fingerstick blood glucose monitoring (BGM) devices. This inevitably raised the regulatory bar for any glucose sensor performance, as regulatory bodies such as the FDA could now point to the accuracy levels of BGM and CGM alternatives already available to the patient. In addition, the Company recognized the advent and significant growth of digital health. Particularly, CGM companies set a new bar for a mobile experience with diabetes data and its associated cloud management, with BGM companies quickly following. Also, from a user experience perspective, while a 60 second measurement time may have been acceptable to the market in the past, we determined this is no longer the case, and that we needed to significantly reduce the time it took to complete a measurement.
 
As a result of these changing dynamics, we concluded that the GlucoTrack 2.0 project scope not only had to reduce the size of our device, but also had to improve the user experience and to significantly improve sensor accuracy. Accordingly, the Company had to return to a research mode to design, develop, and test a new, more innovative device that would meet these criteria and to invest in software development to ensure that the GlucoTrack 2.0 product would be supported by both iOS and Android devices with a cloud-based infrastructure.
 
By the end of 2022 we had a clinical prototype of a newly designed system. This system utilizes ultrasound-only sensor technology, reduces the overall cost and complexity of the device, and reduces the measurement time from 60 seconds to 2 seconds. Initial testing produced promising results, suggesting measurement accuracies could be relatively comparable to those of conventional, already in-the-market CGM technologies. Continued testing however, exposed certain human factors that complicated consistent sensor placement. We have identified several mechanical techniques to address this challenge and we expect to complete this process and begin our first-in-human (FIH) study in the second quarter of 2023. Collecting data for sensor characterization and algorithm development will be the primary goals of the FIH study. The results of this study will also drive the development of the commercial version of the device, which is expected to commence late in the third quarter of 2023. Once the development of the commercial device version is complete, we intend to conduct a scaled down version of the FDA pivotal trial to resolve any lingering device performance or human factors issues prior to executing the larger pivotal trial for FDA submission.

In the fourth quarter of 2022 we acquired certain IP relating to an implantable continuous glucose monitor. We designed and developed a laboratory CGM sensing system, integrated into a cloud-based automated data collection system and a prototype model of this system was implemented and validated. We also designed, manufactured, and tested a prototype sensor lead. In addition, we have identified and consummated key vendor relationships with expertise in designing and manufacturing implantable leads and electronics, and we are developing a sensor life simulation system that will take real bench data as inputs and predict total enzyme longevity.
 
Our focus now is to complete the feasibility assessment of achieving a multi-year implant life. In parallel, we have initiated an implantable electronics design effort. A paper-based design has been completed, and a physical mock-up is expected in the second quarter of 2023, with a targeted prototype design for an animal study to commence in the third quarter of 2023.
 
By the end of 2023 we intend to have completed the feasibility assessment based on bench data and sensor life modeling/prediction, have bench data (in solution) demonstrating at least six months of sensor life without significant degradation, have animal data demonstrating at least three months of sensor life without significant degradation, and have initiated a human clinical device/system design and development program.
 
We have developed our own companion applications and a cloud-based solutions to offer an effective platform to provide real time, data driven personalized tools to effectively help a user manage their diabetes. In addition to being a critical and effective management tool for the end user, we believe that third parties such as insurers, pharmaceutical companies and advertisers would be willing to pay for the de-identified data that we will obtain through our platform, and that this is an opportunity for us to develop an additional revenue source. These applications will be utilized during the clinical trials.
 
We do not have commercial manufacturing facilities and do not intend to build commercial manufacturing facilities of our own in the foreseeable future. Our suppliers and their manufacturing facilities must comply with applicable regulations in the jurisdictions in which our devices are to be marketed (including ISO 13485 in the EU), current quality system regulations, which include current good manufacturing practices, and to the extent laboratory analysis is involved, current good laboratory practices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into agreements with qualified manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that, once contracted, such manufacturers will perform as expected.


Research & Development
 
We focus significant time and resources on research and development in connection with our efforts to continue to develop and improve GlucoTrack, as well as in connection with our development of our implantable continuous glucose monitor. See “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Results of Operation” below for a discussion of the research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended 2022 and 2021.
Regulatory Considerations
 
Healthcare is heavily regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States, and by similar authorities in other countries. Any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country. The laws and regulations affecting healthcare change regularly, thereby increasing the uncertainty and risk associated with any healthcare- related venture. The United States government has in the past considered, is currently considering and may in the future consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly and adversely affect reimbursement for healthcare products such as our devices. These policies have included, and may in the future include: basing reimbursement policies and rates on clinical outcomes, the comparative effectiveness and costs of different treatment technologies and modalities; imposing price controls and taxes on medical device providers; and other measures. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in any jurisdiction in which our devices, may be cleared for sale could also have a negative impact on the demand for our devices. These include changes that may reduce reimbursement or payment rates for such products.

In the United States, the federal government regulates healthcare through various agencies, including but not limited to the following: (i) the FDA, which administers the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as well as other relevant laws; (ii) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), which administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (iii) the Office of Inspector General, which enforces various laws aimed at curtailing fraudulent or abusive practices including, by way of example, the Anti-Kickback Law, the Anti-Physician Referral Law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, the Anti-Inducement Law, the Civil Money Penalty Law, and the laws that authorize the Office of Inspector General to exclude health care providers and others from participating in federal healthcare programs; and (iv) the Office of Civil Rights which administers the privacy and security aspects of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). All of the aforementioned are agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. Healthcare is also provided or regulated, as the case may be, by the Department of Defense through its TriCare program, the Department of Veterans Affairs under, among other laws, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, the Public Health Service within the Department of Health and Human Services under the Public Health Service Act, the Department of Justice through the Federal False Claims Act and various criminal statutes, and state governments under the Medicaid program and their internal laws regulating all healthcare activities. If and when we receive FDA approval to market our devices in the United States, we will be subject to regulation by some or all of the foregoing agencies.
 
The applicable regulatory schemes in the EU are significantly more diverse than those in the United States and do not lend themselves to similar summary. Although the CE Mark system and the MDR require a minimum level of harmonization in the EU, each EU member country may impose additional regulatory requirements. Because there are numerous EU member countries with distinct legal systems, the scope of potential regulatory requirements in each of the EU countries (additional to the harmonized EU requirements) is difficult to summarize or predict.
 
Regulation of the Design, Manufacture and Distribution of Medical Devices
 
Any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory clearances or approvals, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country.
 
Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. These laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex clearance and production controls in others. As a result, the processes and time periods required to obtain foreign marketing approval may be longer or shorter than those necessary to obtain FDA approval (as described below). These differences may affect the efficiency and timeliness of international market introduction of our devices. For countries in the EU, medical devices must display a CE Mark before they may be imported or sold and must comply with the requirements of the MDR. However, although the MDR is applicable throughout the EU, in practice it does not ensure uniform regulation throughout the EU. Rather, the MDR requires only a minimum level of harmonization in the EU. Accordingly, member countries may apply and enforce the MDr’s terms differently, and certain EU member countries may request or require performance and/or safety data in addition to the MDR’s requirements from time to time, on a case-by-case basis. The CE Mark also permits the sale in countries that have an MDR Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU.

In the United States, under Section 201(h) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a medical device is an article which, among other things, is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease in man or other animals. We believe that our devices will be classified as medical devices and subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the FDA and its foreign counterparts. Devices are subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation be conducted before a device receives approval for commercial distribution. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Class I devices are relatively simple and can be manufactured and distributed with general controls. Class II devices are somewhat more complex and require greater scrutiny. Class III devices are new and frequently help sustain life.


In the United States, a company generally can obtain permission to distribute a new device in two ways – through a so-called “510(k)” premarket notification application or through a Section 515 premarket approval (“PMA”) application. The 510(k) submission applies to any device that is substantially equivalent to a device first marketed prior to May 28, 1976 or to another device marketed after that date, but which was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 28, 1976 device. These devices are either Class I or Class II devices. Under the 510(k) submission process, the FDA will issue an order finding substantial equivalence to a predicate device (pre-May 28, 1976 or post-May 28, 1976 device that was substantially equivalent to a pre- May 28, 1976 device) and permitting commercial distribution of that device for its intended use. A 510(k) submission must provide information supporting its claim of substantial equivalence to the predicate device. The FDA permits certain low risk medical devices to be marketed without requiring the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification. In other instances, the FDA may require that a premarket notification not only be submitted, but also be accompanied by clinical data. If clinical data from human experiments are required to support the 510(k) submissions, these data must be gathered in compliance with investigational device exemption regulations for investigations performed in the United States. The FDA review process for premarket notifications submitted pursuant to section 510(k) should take about 90 days, but it can take substantially longer if the FDA has concerns, and there is no guarantee that the FDA will clear the device for marketing, in which case the device cannot be lawfully distributed in the United States. If the FDA finds that the device subject to the premarket notification is substantially equivalent to a proper predicate device, then the FDA may “clear” that device for marketing. These devices are not “approved” by the FDA. There is no guarantee, however, that the FDA will deem the device subject to the 510(k) process, as opposed to the more time-consuming, resource intensive and problematic PMA application process described below.
 
The more comprehensive PMA process applies to a new device that either is not substantially equivalent to a pre-May 28, 1976 product or is to be used in supporting or sustaining life or preventing impairment. These devices are normally Class III devices and can only be marketed following approval of a PMA application. For example, most implantable devices are subject to the PMA approval process. Two steps of FDA approval generally are required before a company can market a product in the U.S. that is subject to Section 515 PMA approval, as compared to a Section 510(k) clearance. First, a company must comply with investigational device exemption regulations in connection with any human clinical investigation of the device; however, those regulations permit a company to undertake a clinical study of a “non-significant risk” device without formal FDA approval. Prior express FDA approval is required if the device is a significant risk device. If there is any doubt as to whether a device is a “non-significant risk” device, companies normally seek prior approval from the FDA. Normally, clinical studies of new diagnostic products are conducted in tandem with a cleared or approved device and treatment decisions are based on the results from the existing diagnostic device. In such a setting, the FDA may consider the clinical trial as one not posing a significant risk. However, FDA action is always uncertain and dependent on the contours of the design of the clinical trial and the device and there is no assurance that the FDA would consider any proposed clinical trial as one posing a non-significant risk. Moreover, before undertaking any clinical trial, the company sponsoring the trial and the investigator conducting the trial are required by federal law to seek and obtain the approval of institutional review boards (“IRB”). An IRB weighs the risks and benefits of a proposed trial to ensure that the human subjects are not exposed to unnecessary risk and reviews the informed consent form to ensure that it meets federal requirements and accurately describes the risks and benefits, if any, of the clinical trial. IRB review occurs annually, and annual re-approval is required. University medical centers as well as other entities maintain and operate IRB. Second, the FDA must review a company’s PMA, which contains, among other things, clinical information acquired under the investigational device exemption. The FDA will approve the PMA if it finds there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The premarket approval process takes substantially longer than the 510(k) process.

The GlucoTrack® 1.0 has not been approved for commercial sale in the United States. The GlucoTrack® 2.0 is still under development and has not yet been approved for commercial sale in or outside the United States. In prior discussions with the FDA regarding the regulatory pathway, the FDA is not yet entirely sure whether a de novo pathway is acceptable and recommended that the Company should plan to support this approach through risk analysis and an explanation of why the new measurement paradigm it is proposing does not introduce greater risks. FDA noted that no decision has been made that a PMA will be required. The implantable CGM product will most likely fall under the PMA process.


Even when a clinical study has been approved or cleared by the FDA or a notified body or deemed approved, the study is subject to factors beyond a manufacturer’s control, including, but not limited to the fact that the IRB at a given clinical site might not approve the study, might decline to renew approval which is required annually, or might suspend or terminate the study before the study has been completed. Also, the interim results of a study may not be satisfactory, in which case the sponsor may terminate or suspend the study on its own initiative or the FDA or a notified body may terminate or suspend the study. There is no assurance that a clinical study at any given site will progress as anticipated; there may be an insufficient number of patients who qualify for the study or who agree to participate in the study, or the investigator at the site may have priorities other than the study. Also, there can be no assurance that the clinical study will provide sufficient evidence to assure the FDA or a notified body that the product is safe and effective, a prerequisite for FDA approval of a PMA, or substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a predicate device, a prerequisite for clearance under 510(k). Even if the FDA or a notified body approves or clears a device, it may limit its intended uses in such a way that manufacturing and distributing the device may not be commercially feasible.
 
After clearance or approval to market is given, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, upon the occurrence of certain events, are authorized under various circumstances to withdraw the clearance or approval or require changes to a device, its manufacturing process or its labeling or additional proof that regulatory requirements have been met.
 
A manufacturer of a device approved through the PMA process is not permitted to make changes to the device which affects its safety or effectiveness without first submitting a supplement application to its PMA and obtaining FDA approval for that supplement. In some instances, the FDA may require clinical trials to support a supplement application. A manufacturer of a device cleared through a 510(k) submission must submit another premarket notification if it intends to make a change or modification in the device that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, such as a significant change or modification in design, material, chemical composition, energy source or manufacturing process. Any change in the intended uses of a PMA device or a 510(k) device requires an approval supplement or cleared premarket notification. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported, as well as certain FDA export requirements.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law on March 23, 2010, and on March 30, 2010, a reconciliation bill that modifies certain provisions of the same was signed into law. These two laws are jointly referred to as the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA.”
 
The principal aim of the ACA was to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million Americans who were uninsured. The law’s most far-reaching changes did not take effect until 2014, including a requirement that most Americans carry health insurance. The consequences of these significant coverage expansions on the sales of our products is still unknown and speculative at this point, although the ACA and certain state initiatives may compel private insurers to reduce coverage or reimbursement for various items and services, including medical devices of the type that we contemplate distributing.
 
This legislation contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions. The most relevant of these provisions are those that impose fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. Beginning in 2013, each medical device manufacturer is required to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) in an amount equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices. The tax applies to all medical devices, including our products and product candidates. The ACA also provides for increased enforcement of the fraud and abuse regulations previously mentioned.
 
There are ongoing discussions in the EU regarding amending the relevant regulatory framework. It is difficult to predict what effect any amendments to the existing EU legislation may have. Furthermore, each individual EU member country has the authority to amend its regulations and requirements additional to the minimum harmonization required by the MDR. Because the EU member countries have diverse legal systems, it is difficult to predict what, if any, amendments may be implemented in each of the EU member countries and whether they may adversely affect us.
 
We anticipate that sales volumes and prices of our products will depend in large part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and workers’ compensation plans. These third-party payors may deny reimbursement for a product or therapy if they determine that the product was not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Some third-party payors must also approve coverage for new or innovative devices before they will reimburse health care providers who use the products. Even though a new product may have been cleared for commercial distribution, it may find limited demand for the device until reimbursement approval has been obtained from governmental and private third-party payors.


Inasmuch as a percentage of the projected patient population that could potentially benefit from our products is elderly, Medicare would likely be a potential source of reimbursement in the United States. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, certain disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and those suffering from Lou Gehrig’s disease. In contrast, Medicaid is a medical assistance program jointly funded by United States federal and state governments and administered by each state pursuant to which benefits are available to certain indigent patients. The Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and Medicaid.


Medicare reimburses for medical devices in a variety of ways depending on where and how the device is used. However, Medicare only provides reimbursement if CMS determines that the device should be covered and that the use of the device is consistent with the coverage criteria. A coverage determination can be made at the local level by the Medicare administrative contractor (formerly called carriers and fiscal intermediaries) or a private contractor that processes and pays claims on behalf of CMS for the geographic area where the services were rendered, or at the national level by CMS. There are new statutory provisions intended to facilitate coverage determinations for new technologies under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 §731 and §942, but it is unclear how these new provisions will be implemented. Coverage presupposes that the device has been cleared or approved by the FDA and, further, that the coverage will be no broader than the approved intended uses of the device (i.e., the device’s label) as cleared or approved by the FDA, but coverage can be narrower. In that regard, a narrow Medicare coverage determination may undermine the commercial viability of a device.

Obtaining a coverage determination, whether local or national, is a time-consuming, expensive and highly uncertain proposition, especially for a new technology, and inconsistent local determinations are possible. On average, according to an industry report, Medicare coverage determinations for medical devices lag 15 months to five years or more behind FDA approval for respective devices. Moreover, Medicaid programs and private insurers are frequently influenced by Medicare coverage determinations. A key component in the reimbursement decision by most private insurers will be whether our products is reimbursed by virtue of a national coverage determination by CMS. We may negotiate contracted rates our products with private insurance providers for the purchase of our products by their members pending a coverage determination by CMS. Our inability to obtain a favorable coverage determination for our products may adversely affect our ability to market our products and thus, the commercial viability of the product. In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines. Distributors expressly support the reimbursement process and, depending on the distribution agreement and geographic area, may assume responsibility for the process.


We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. Furthermore, deficit reduction and austerity measures in the United States and abroad may put further pressure on governments to limit coverage of, and reimbursement for, our products. There can be no assurance that third-party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payor coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Until reimbursement or insurance coverage is established, patients will have to bear the financial cost of our products. Third-party coverage may be particularly difficult to obtain while our products is not approved by the FDA as a replacement for existing single-point finger stick devices.


Outside the United States, availability of reimbursement from third parties varies widely from country to country. Within the EU, member countries’ medical reimbursement and healthcare coverage regulations and systems differ significantly. It is, therefore, difficult to analyze and predict the prospect of consistent availability of adequate reimbursement in the various EU member countries.
 
Anti-Fraud and Abuse Rule
 
There are extensive United States federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry that can result in significant criminal and civil penalties that can materially affect us, if and when we receive FDA approval to market our products in the United States. These federal laws include, by way of example, the following:
 

● | The anti-kickback statute (Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act), which prohibits certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other governmental programs; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The physician self-referral prohibition (Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, as amended, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act), which prohibits referrals by physicians of Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated healthcare services in which the physicians (or their immediate family members) have ownership interests or with which they have certain other financial arrangements; 


14
--


● | The anti-inducement provisions of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Social Security Act), which prohibit providers from offering anything to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to induce that beneficiary to use items or services covered by either program; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq.), which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government (including the Medicare and Medicaid programs); and 
● | The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (Section 1128A of the Social Security Act), which authorizes the United States Department of Health and Human Services to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent or abusive acts. 

 
Sanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, monetary penalties, imprisonment and/or denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or both. These laws also impose an affirmative duty on those receiving Medicare or Medicaid funding to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the Medicare and other government programs.
 
Many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar to the federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which extend beyond the Medicare and Medicaid programs, to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of whether the service was reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have also adopted or are considering legislative proposals to increase patient protections, such as limiting the use and disclosure of patient specific health information. These state laws also impose criminal and civil penalties similar to the federal laws.
 
Similarly, the EU and EU member countries may have similar fraud and abuse laws which would regulate our business in those jurisdictions. However, given the diversity of legal systems within the EU, it is difficult to predict with specificity what anti-fraud legislation and regulations may be implemented and the penalties that they impose.
 
In the ordinary course of their business, medical device manufacturers and suppliers have been and are subject regularly to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. Recent federal and state legislation has greatly increased funding for investigations and enforcement actions, which have increased dramatically over the past several years. This trend is expected to continue. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud also has increased due in large part to amendments to the civil False Claims Act in 1986 that were designed to encourage private persons to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits by private persons, known as qui tam relators, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients or nurses and other employees, as well as competitors. HIPAA, in addition to its privacy provisions, created a series of new healthcare-related crimes.
 
As federal and state budget pressures continue, federal and state administrative agencies may also continue to escalate investigation and enforcement efforts to root out waste and to control fraud and abuse in governmental healthcare programs. A violation of any of these federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on a supplier’s liquidity and financial condition. An investigation into the use of a device by physicians may dissuade physicians from recommending that their patients use the device. This could have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize our products.
 
The Privacy Provisions of HIPAA
 
In the United States, HIPAA, among other things, protects the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information by limiting its use and disclosure. HIPAA directly regulates “covered entities,” such as healthcare providers, insurers and clearinghouses, and regulates “business associates,” with respect to the privacy of patients’ medical information. All entities that receive and process protected health information are required to adopt certain procedures to safeguard the security of that information. It is uncertain whether we would be deemed to be a covered entity under HIPAA and, owing to changes in the law, it is uncertain, based on our current business model, whether we would be a business associate. Nevertheless, we will likely be contractually required to physically safeguard the integrity and security of any patient information that we receive, store, create or transmit in the United States. If we fail to adhere to our contractual commitments, then our physician, hospital or insurance customers may be subject to civil monetary penalties, which could adversely affect our ability to market our devices. Changes in the law wrought by the provisions of Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, increase the duties of business associates and covered entities with respect to protected health information that thereby subject them to direct government regulation, increasing its compliance costs and exposure to civil monetary penalties and other government sanctions. While HITECH does not alter the definition of a business associate, it makes it more likely that covered entities with whom we are likely to do business in the United States, if and when we receive FDA approval to market GlucoTrack® in the United States, will require us to enter into business associate agreements.

Intellectual Property
 
We maintain a proactive intellectual property strategy, which includes patent filings in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States and other commercially significant markets. We currently hold 59 issued patents in various regions including patents issued by the United States, Australian, Brazilian, Canadian, Chinese, European, Hong Kong, Indian, Israeli, Japanese, Korean, Mexican, Philippine, Russian, South African, and Taiwanese patent offices that cover various parts of our technology, which include A Method Of Monitoring Glucose Levels, Device For Non-Invasively Measuring Glucose, Individual Measuring Channels For Non-Invasively Measuring Glucose, Ear Clip For Medical Monitoring Device. However, since we have taken Glucotrack 1.0 form the market, we have not maintained these patents across the geographies. New IP is being generated for both Glucotrack 2.0 and the Invasive CGM that will add to our patent portfolio while providing more longevity.
 
We understand the importance of obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to file for and obtain patent protection of our principal products and procedures, to defend existing or future patents, to maintain trade secrets and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.
 
We have obtained trademark registrations for GlucoTrack® in various countries, including the US, Europe, China and Israel, and also own an allowed trademark applications for GlucoTrack® in Canada. Trademark registrations were issued in ten countries for “JUST CLIP IT,” including France and China, and additional applications are pending in three countries, including the United States. In addition, trademark registrations were issued in seven countries for “YOUR TRACK TO HEALTH,” including France and China, and additional applications are pending in three countries, including the United States. Trademark registrations have been issued in Israel to register “Integrity,” the Company’s logo and the GlucoTrack logo. Registration have issued in Hong Kong and Taiwan and are pending in China and Singapore to register GlucoTrack in Chinese characters. Our application in South Korea to register GlucoTrack in Korean characters has been allowed.
 
We believe that our patents and products do not and will not infringe patents or violate proprietary rights of others, although it is possible that our existing patent rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents or proprietary rights may occur. Litigation may be necessary to defend or enforce our patent rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Defense and enforcement of patent claims can be expensive and time consuming, even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable, and could result in the diversion of substantial resources and management time and attention from our other activities. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liability to third parties, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, require us to alter our products or processes, or require that we cease altogether any related research and development activities or product sales.
 
Patent protection is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions and issues. The patent application and issuance process can be expected to take several years and entails considerable expense. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued as a result of any applications or that any patents resulting from such applications or our existing patents will be sufficiently broad to afford protection against competitors with similar or competing technology. Patents that we obtain may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or the rights granted under such patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages.
 
Competition
 
The market for blood glucose monitoring devices is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions. Four companies, Roche; LifeScan, Inc., a division of Johnson & Johnson; Abbott Laboratories; and Ascensia, a spin off from the Bayer Corporation, currently account for substantially all of the worldwide sales of self-monitored glucose testing systems. These competitors’ products use a meter and disposable test strips to test blood obtained by pricking the finger or, in some cases, the palm or forearm.

Within the last few years, Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices have been introduced into the market and will compete with GlucoTrack® and our future devices. Currently, to our knowledge, three different brands have obtained FDA clearance to market and are selling CGM devices in the U.S. These brands are sold by Medtronic plc., Abbott Laboratories, and Dexcom, Inc. Several new and smaller players have obtained clearance to market in EU, although their performances are significantly inferior to those of Medtronic, Abbott, and DexCom. CGM devices are invasive devices, in which a needle is inserted under the skin (either in the abdomen or the upper arm) and measures interstitial fluid. Although we cannot predict what standards will be employed by applicable regulatory authorities as we seek FDA clearance, the results achieved by GlucoTrack® 2.0 in our safety and performance clinical trial conducted were similar to the results obtained from the CGM devices that have been introduced to the market, as of the time of their introduction. As mentioned above, we expect the performance requirements from the regulating agencies will be more stringent as the CGM products have improved their performance since initial market introduction.


In addition, other companies are developing non-invasive glucose testing devices and technologies that could compete with our devices. There are also a number of academic and other institutions involved in various phases of technology development regarding blood glucose monitoring devices. We believe that the majority of non-invasive glucose monitors in development require frequent calibrations (from a few hours to a few days, compared to the GlucoTrack® 1.0, which has a demonstrated efficacy period of six months from the initial calibration). Other than Know Labs and Movano, companies known to be developing non-invasive measurement devices are all privately held such as Alertgy, Gwave, Diamontech, Boydsense, etc. Companies known to be developing an implantable CGM are Sensionics and privately-held Profusa and Indigo Diabetes NV.


Some of our competitors are either publicly traded or are divisions of publicly-traded companies, and they enjoy several competitive advantages, including:
 

● | significantly greater name recognition; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | established relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors; 
● | established distribution networks; 
● | additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; 
● | greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval for products and marketing approved products; and 
● | greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, and patent litigation. 

 
Some of our other non-publicly traded competitors also enjoy these competitive advantages. As a result, we cannot assure that we will be able to compete effectively against these companies or their products.

GlucoTrack® does not directly measure the glucose level concentration in the blood. Rather, it measures several physiological phenomena that are correlated with the glucose level. In order to correlate between the measured signal and the glucose level, a translation is needed. This translation is accomplished through the individual calibration of the device by reference to a measurement obtained from an invasive device.
 
Non-invasive devices under different stages of development generally require frequent recalibration. For example, GlucoWatch, a single non-invasive product for glucose trend analysis that was previously approved for sale by the FDA, but which is no longer available commercially, required recalibrations approximately every 13 hours. The main reasons for calibration are that tissue parameters generally fluctuate in the area of the measurement and are sensitive to the location of the sensor and the impact of potential disturbances. Disturbances are less frequent in the earlobes, where GlucoTrack® takes its measurements. Utilizing three channels simultaneously reduces the noise contribution in the measurement. In addition, the personal ear clip contains sensors to help users attach the device to the proper part of the ear lobe.
 
GlucoTrack® 1.0 has received CE Mark approval, which allows us to market and sell GlucoTrack® 1.0 glucose monitoring device in EU member countries that have adopted the MDD without being subject to additional national regulations with regard to demonstration of performance and safety. While the MDD is applicable throughout the EU, it requires only a minimum level of harmonization among member countries. Accordingly, member countries may apply and enforce the MDD’s terms differently, and certain EU member countries may request or require performance and/or safety data additional to the MDD’s requirements from time to time, on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the MDD notwithstanding, because the regulatory regimes of the EU member countries are significantly diverse, it is difficult to predict future regulatory developments and risks. GlucoTrack® 1.0 has not yet been cleared or approved for commercial sale in any other jurisdiction, including the United States. See “Government Regulation - Regulation of the Design, Manufacture and Distribution of Medical Devices” below for a discussion of the approval process for commercial sale in the United States. There can be no assurance that approval for commercial sale in any additional jurisdiction will be obtained on a timely basis or at all. GlucoTrack 2.0 is currently under development.
