 Item 1. Business 
 Introduction 
 
We are a leading manufacturer, designer, and provider of consumer products for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiast. We are one of the largest manufacturers of handguns, modern sporting rifles, and handcuffs in the United States and an active participant in the hunting rifle and suppressor markets. We are also a leading provider of shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor products and accessories, including knives and cutting tools, sighting lasers, shooting supplies, tree saws, and survival gear.
 
Smith & Wesson was founded in 1852 by Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson. Mr. Wesson purchased Mr. Smith’s interest in 1873. The Wesson family sold Smith & Wesson Corp., our wholly owned subsidiary, to Bangor Punta Corp. in 1965. Lear Siegler Corporation purchased Bangor Punta in 1984, thereby acquiring ownership of Smith & Wesson Corp. Forstmann Little & Co. purchased Lear Siegler in 1986 and sold Smith & Wesson Corp. shortly thereafter to Tomkins Corporation, an affiliate of U.K.-based Tomkins PLC. We purchased Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins in May 2001 and renamed our company Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation. 
 In January 2017, we changed the name of our company from Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation to American Outdoor Brands Corporation to better reflect our expanding strategic focus on the growing markets for shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiasts. We believe that the name “American Outdoor Brands Corporation” better reflects our family of brands, our broad range of product offerings, and our plan to continue building upon our portfolio of strong American brands. We have two reporting segments: (1) Firearms and (2) Outdoor Products & Accessories. 
 In our Firearms segment, we manufacture a wide array of handguns (including revolvers and pistols), long guns (including modern sporting rifles, bolt action rifles, and muzzleloaders), handcuffs, suppressors, and other firearm-related products for sale to a wide variety of customers, including gun enthusiasts, collectors, hunters, sportsmen, competitive shooters, individuals desiring home and personal protection, law enforcement and security agencies and officers, and military agencies in the United States and throughout the world. We sell our firearm products under the Smith & Wesson, M&P, Performance Center, Thompson/Center Arms, and Gemtech brands. We manufacture our firearm products at our facilities in Springfield, Massachusetts, Houlton, Maine, and Deep River, Connecticut. We also sell our manufacturing services to other businesses to level-load our factories. We sell those services under our Smith & Wesson and Smith & Wesson Precision Components brands. 
 In our Outdoor Products & Accessories segment, we design, source, distribute, and manufacture reloading, gunsmithing, and gun cleaning supplies; high-quality stainless-steel cutting tools and accessories; flashlights; tree saws and related trimming accessories; shooting supplies, rests, and other related accessories; apparel; vault accessories; laser grips and laser sights; and a full range of products for survival and emergency preparedness. We sell our outdoor products and accessories under the following brands: Caldwell, Wheeler, Tipton, Frankford Arsenal, Lockdown, Hooyman, BOG, Crimson Trace, Imperial, Schrade, Old Timer, Uncle Henry, BUBBA, Smith & Wesson, M&P, Thompson/Center, and UST. We develop and market our outdoor products and accessories at our facilities in Columbia, Missouri; Wilsonville, Oregon; and Jacksonville, Florida. We have announced a plan to transition our Ultimate Survival Technologies, LLC, or UST, business and operations located in our facility in Jacksonville, Florida to our Columbia, Missouri facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

Our objective is to continue to strengthen our position as one of the world’s leading firearm manufacturers and expand our position as a provider of high-quality and innovative outdoor products and accessories for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets.
 Key elements of our strategy to achieve this objective and deliver long-term stockholder value are as follows: 
  
• | drive organic growth by leveraging our brands and maintaining a robust product pipeline to increase market share in markets in which we participate and expand into adjacent and complementary markets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | design, produce, and market high-quality, innovative firearms, firearms and hunting accessories, and rugged outdoor products that meet the needs and desires of our consumer and professional customers and that drive customer satisfaction and loyalty;

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 We estimate that the annual domestic non-military firearm market based on industry shipments is approximately $2.2 billion for handguns and $2.0 billion for long guns, excluding shotguns, with our market share in calendar 2018, based on the latest data, being approximately 14.5% and 5.1
%, respectively. According to 2017 reports by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, the U.S. firearm manufacturing industry has shown no compound annual growth between 2012 and 2017 in spite of individual years where units manufactured have grown as much as 26.0% in one year. 
 A report issued by the Outdoor Industry Association, a leading trade organization for the outdoor industry, estimates that the annual U.S. domestic hunting and shooting market is approximately $16 billion, while the annual U.S. domestic outdoor recreation market is approximately $90 billion to $100 billion, which includes hunting and shooting, as well as camping, fishing, trail sports, and wildlife watching.
 We have substantially expanded and diversified our business in recent years through internal growth and strategic acquisitions. The following table sets forth certain information about the current product lines that we added to our operations through acquisitions in the fiscal years indicated:

Strategy 
 Our objective is to be the leading provider of quality products for the shooting, hunting, and outdoor enthusiast by enhancing our position as one of the world’s leading firearm manufacturers and expanding our position as a provider of high-quality outdoor products and accessories for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this objective are as follows:
Drive Organic Growth by Leveraging Brands and Designing Innovative New Products
 We are focused on driving organic growth by ensuring a robust new product pipeline and leveraging our brands to help us to increase market share in markets in which we participate and to expand into adjacent and complementary markets. 
 As we focus on all of our brands, we plan to continue to expand existing customer relationships built on brand loyalty and trust. Thus, we will seek to (1) enter market segments that match our core consumer’s passions for shooting, hunting, and outdoor activities, (2) acquire and create brands that are authentic, innovative, and differentiated in the market, (3) support and retain management teams that have an intimate understanding of the end consumer, a demonstrated track record of success, and a clear strategy for growth, and (4) meet profitability goals by providing an acceptable rate of return within the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets. In addition, our goal is to continue to build our business in ways that allow us to optimize our current channel relationships, which serve our existing consumers, including distributors, large strategic retailers, buying groups, and internet retailers.
 
We plan to leverage our brands in Firearms by (1) capitalizing on the goodwill developed through our historic 167 year old “Smith & Wesson” brand as well as our extensive portfolio of other well-known brands, such as M&P, Performance Center, Thompson/Center Arms, and Gemtech, (2) enhancing our relationships with key retailers, distributors, and buying groups and using our standard margin advantage to engage in competitive promotional activities, and (3) introducing new products, especially in the polymer handgun market as represented by our M&P brand. During the last two fiscal years, we have introduced numerous new products, including variations and product lines around the Smith & Wesson, M&P, Thompson/Center, Gemtech, and Performance Center brands. We plan to continue to introduce new firearm products in fiscal 2020.
 
With 20 unique brands in Outdoor Products & Accessories, including the iconic Smith & Wesson brand, we have created a handful of talented teams, referred to as “brand lanes,” that are organized around a common set of brand characteristics and consumer types. Each brand lane has dedicated brand management, creative design, and content production teams that work closely with product management, product development, and engineering functions. This structure allows us to focus on a full spectrum of brand and product initiatives with detailed brand activation plans centered around marketing, sales, and e-commerce teams. Under the brand lane structure, marketing generates digital and related content while the e-commerce teams distribute that content, and the sales team works with retailers to coordinate channel marketing activities. We have modernized and upgraded many of our outdoor and accessory brands, which now include Caldwell (shooting range products), Tipton (gun cleaning products), Wheeler (gunsmithing tools), Frankford Arsenal (ammunition reloading products), Hooyman (land management tools), BOG (hunting gear), Uncle Henry (hunting knives/tools), Old Timer (cutlery/tools), Imperial (cutlery/tools), Lockdown (storage solutions), Crimson Trace (firearm aiming solutions), LaserLyte (firearm training systems), UST (survival and camping products), Schrade (camp cutlery/tools), BUBBA (fishing gear), and KeyGear (camping products and tools). We also offer firearm accessories and non-firearm accessories, such as flashlights and knives, under our Firearms brands, including Smith & Wesson, M&P, Performance Center, and Thompson/Center Arms.

Design, Produce, and Market High-Quality Products that Drive Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty
 
We are focused on designing, producing, and marketing high-quality, innovative firearms, hunting, and rugged outdoor products and accessories that meet the needs and desires of our consumer and professional customers and that drive customer satisfaction and loyalty.  Our ongoing research and development, product engineering, product sourcing, marketing, and distribution activities are critical components of our ability to offer successful products.
 We believe that by offering high-quality products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis, as well as providing world-class customer service, training, and support, we will drive customer satisfaction and loyalty.  We regard our high-quality, innovative products as the most important aspect of our customer satisfaction and loyalty, but we also offer customer service and support with various programs, such as toll-free customer support numbers, e-mail customer question and answer communications, broad service policies, and product warranties.Create a Leverageable Infrastructure by Streamlining and Standardizing our Business Operations, including Optimizing Product Distribution 
 We intend to continue to streamline and standardize certain administrative functions of our business. For example, we operate in a shared services structure so that support and administrative functions, including human resources, accounting, finance, program management, legal, compliance, environmental, health, and safety, or EH&S, and information technology, can be leveraged across multiple locations to achieve efficiency and improved internal controls. In addition, we are leveraging our manufacturing expertise by creating a manufacturing services platform in our Springfield, Massachusetts facility. A streamlined and standardized approach requires investing in an integrated and configurable technology infrastructure in areas such as enterprise resource planning, or ERP, and compliance. We intend to continue investing in such systems to further enhance our efficiency, improve information reporting, and strengthen internal controls. These system improvements include the expansion of our existing SAP system to eventually cover substantially all of our facilities.
 We are streamlining and standardizing our business operations, and simplifying our go-to-process, by optimizing our sales and product distribution through a centralized sales and logistics facility in Columbia, Missouri, which we have recently constructed. All business functions of our Outdoor Products & Accessories division will also eventually be housed at this facility, which we are calling our Missouri campus. We are in the process of eliminating 575,000 square feet of operations, office, warehouse, and third-party space across multiple locations and folding those operations into the Missouri campus. The objective of this strategy is to centralize the inventory management, sales, and distribution of finished products to optimize logistics expertise and yield optimal sales and tax efficiencies, as well as to more quickly harvest financial synergies from acquisitions. This strategy will also generate capacity for future growth and is also expected to eventually yield higher inventory turns, better customer service, and an ability to support an omni-channel customer base as our company expands further into the rugged outdoor market. 
 
Pursue Acquisitions that are Synergistic with our Current Business
 We intend to continue to complement our organic growth initiatives by pursuing strategic acquisitions that will enable us to expand our product offerings by leveraging existing brands and adding new brands, penetrate adjacent and complementary markets, increase our marketing and distribution, and enhance virtual integration, especially when we believe we can improve the performance and profitability of an acquired company through the implementation of our operating methods, strategies, and shared services center structure. During the last four fiscal years, we have spent nearly $400.0 million on acquiring companies and brands to support our growth in the outdoor products and accessories market. For example, in fiscal 2015, the TTPP acquisition provided vertical integration and the BTI acquisition allowed us to expand our presence in the accessories and outdoor products markets and to leverage BTI’s broad portfolio of hunting and shooting accessories brands. In addition, the BTI acquisition allowed us to leverage key firearm brands, such as Smith & Wesson, M&P, and Thompson/Center Arms, expanding those brands into the accessories market with products such as flashlights, knives, and tools. In fiscal 2017, we acquired Crimson Trace Corporation, Taylor Brands, LLC, and Ultimate Survival Technologies, Inc., which allowed us to capitalize on established brands to expand into the electro-optics, knife, and survival and camping equipment markets, respectively. We further expanded our knife offerings, and entered the large fishing accessories market, in fiscal 2018 when we purchased Bubba Blade branded knives, a provider of premium branded sports knives and tools for fishing and hunting. We have now expanded that business into other types of fishing gear and accessories, as

well as rebranded it as BUBBA. We further expanded our offerings in fiscal 2018 and 2019 when we acquired Gemini Technologies, Incorporated, or Gemtech, a leading provider of quality suppressors and accessories for the consumer, law enforcement, and military market, as well as LaserLyte, a provider of laser training and sighting products for the consumer market.
 Firearm Products and Manufacturing Services 
 
General
 Our firearm products combine our legacy of 167 years of American manufacturing and engineering expertise with modern technological advances. We strive to leverage our tradition of innovation in materials, performance, and engineering, along with our proven history of reliability, to produce feature-rich, safe, durable, accurate, and high-performing firearms that satisfy the needs of our broad range of customers. Our introduction of new firearm products is intended to enhance our competitive position and broaden our participation in the overall firearm market. 
 We have substantially enhanced the breadth and quality of our portfolio of firearm products over the years. We have always been a leader in the revolver market. The introduction of our popular M&P branded pistol in January 2005 resulted in our company becoming one of the leaders in the polymer pistol market as well, serving both the consumer sporting goods market and law enforcement agencies. The launch of our M&P branded modern sporting rifle in January 2006 has enabled us to capture what we estimate is the leading share of the modern sporting rifle market. The addition of our Thompson/Center Arms brand of hunting firearms and interchangeable firearm systems into our product portfolio in January 2007 enhanced our long gun barrel manufacturing capabilities for our modern sporting rifles. The addition of our Gemtech branded suppressor products in August 2017 expanded our firearm related product offerings. Our suppressors are compatible with most pistols and rifles on the market and complement our firearm products. We currently participate in three categories of the long gun market: bolt action rifles, muzzleloaders, and modern sporting rifles; and both core categories of the handgun market: semi-automatic pistols and revolvers. 
 All of our firearms and firearm related products are currently sold under our Smith & Wesson, M&P, Performance Center, Thompson/Center Arms, and Gemtech brands. Our customers include distributors; federal, state, and municipal law enforcement agencies and officers; government and military agencies; retailers; and consumers. 
 Our product development strategy is to understand our customers’ needs and preferences and then design and develop products to uniquely meet those requirements. Throughout this process, we test multiple concepts with firearm owners and potential purchasers. We compare these test results against a growing database of prior concepts to identify those with the greatest market potential. Additional market research is completed to optimize the desired features and benefits. While this development process is ongoing, our launch timing for new products depends on market conditions to maximize sales across the entire product portfolio. In fiscal 2019, we launched several new products and product line extensions under our Smith & Wesson, M&P, Performance Center, Thompson/Center Arms, and Gemtech brands. 
 
Firearm Products
 
In fiscal 2019, we further expanded our Smith & Wesson branded products by reintroducing the Model 610 10mm revolver, a stainless-steel revolver available in 4” and 6.5” barrel lengths, designed for personal protection and hunting. We also introduced our enhanced version of our Model 642 small frame revolver with a Crimson Trace Lasergrip. 
 
In fiscal 2019, we introduced several additions and enhancements to our popular line of M&P branded pistols and M&P modern sporting rifles. We enhanced our M&P M2.0 product platform by introducing a 45 Auto caliber model for our M&P M2.0 compact series and we added a shorter 3.6 inch barrel to our M&P M2.0 compact series 9mm and 40 S&W caliber models. Our compact series M&P M2.0 pistols, introduced in fiscal 2018, offer the same features as the full-size M&P M2.0 pistols, including a lighter, crisp trigger pull and a tactile, audible reset, as well as an aggressive grip texture for increased control and four interchangeable dimensional palmswell grip sizes. The M&P M2.0 compact received the NRA American Rifleman Golden Bullseye Award for Handgun of the Year.

We further enhanced our M&P M2.0 product platform, and enhanced our already popular M&P Shield pistol products, by offering a 45 Auto caliber for our concealed carry M&P Shield M2.0 pistol. This M&P45 Shield M2.0 pistol features an aggressive grip texture for increased control and a lighter crisp trigger pull and is offered with a Crimson Trace integrated red or green laser. 
 
In addition, we enhanced our popular M&P380 Shield EZ pistol by adding a Crimson Trace green Laserguard. Our M&P380 Shield EZ was awarded two NRA Publications Golden Bullseye Awards and was the top scoring pistol in the American Rifleman’s Ladies Pistol Project #3 study. The M&P380 Shield EZ features an easy-to-rack slide, easy-to-load magazine, and easy-to-clean design that allows consumers of all statures and strengths the opportunity to own, comfortably practice with, and effectively utilize this pistol for personal protection. Since its introduction in 2012, the M&P Shield pistol has become one of the most popular concealed carry firearms in the market as demonstrated by the milestone shipment of the three millionth M&P Shield pistol in fiscal 2019.
 
Within our M&P rifle products, we enhanced our M&P 15-22 SPORT and M&P 15-22 SPORT II by adding optic-ready rifles complete with a mounted Crimson Trace red or green dot electronic sight.
 Our customers continue to demand premium firearms that provide a competitive edge in sport shooting and hunting. Our Performance Center products are engineered and manufactured to meet this need, and they incorporate many custom features not found on our standard products, such as enhanced triggers for smoother trigger pull, ported barrels for better muzzle control, and specialty sights for quicker target acquisition.  During fiscal 2019, we expanded our Performance Center revolver offerings with the introduction of two new Model 19 revolvers and a Model 442 revolver that can be used for competition shooting, hunting, and personal protection. We also introduced a new Performance Center SW22 Victory target pistol for competition shooting with a scandium light weight frame and easy-to-rack slide. In addition, we introduced six new long-range rifles and two new .22 caliber rifles for hunting and target shooting. 
 Within our Thompson/Center Arms branded products, we continued to focus on expanding our bolt action rifle business while maintaining our leadership in muzzleloaders and interchangeable systems. We introduced the Thompson/Center T/CR22 semi-automatic rifle, which is designed to meet the needs and desires of hunters, plinkers, and first-time shooters. The T/CR22 offers a green fiber optic front sight, an adjustable rear peep sight for quick target acquisitions, a built in Picatinny rail system, a threaded barrel, and a 10-round rotary magazine. 
 Our firearm business is seasonal with revenue generally peaking in our fourth fiscal quarter, which ends April 30, as a result of most industry events and distributor shows normally scheduled during the early spring months. In addition, because of our operating schedule, which includes a summer and a winter shutdown of our firearm manufacturing facilities, we have an increased number of operating days in our fourth fiscal quarter, which allows our shipping and production volumes to exceed other quarters. Seasonality, however, can be disrupted by external events that may drive sales or impact channel inventories, which may slow or accelerate our sales. 
 Firearms net sales for the years ended April 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $478.5 million, $449.0 million, and $773.0 million, respectively. Firearm gross profit for the years ended April 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 totaled $152.8 million, $123.2 million, and $314.6 million, respectively. Total assets for our Firearms business totaled $389.7 million and $346.5 million as of April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Refer to our consolidated financial statements, commencing on page F-1 of this report, for more information regarding our firearm business. 
 Sales of our handguns accounted for $336.9 million, or 52.8%, of total net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019; $326.3 million, or 53.8%, of total net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2018; and $556.6 million, or 61.6%, of total net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017. Sales of long guns accounted for $107.7 million, or 16.9%, of total net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019; $90.2 million, or 14.9%, of total net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2018; and $179.6 million, or 19.9%, of total net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017. Sales of other products and services accounted for $33.9 million, or 5.3%, of total net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019; $32.5 million, or 5.4%, of total net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2018; and $36.8 million, or 4.1%, of total net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017.

Handguns 
 We currently manufacture an extensive variety of handgun models that includes revolvers and pistols. A revolver is a handgun with a cylinder that holds the ammunition in a series of rotating chambers that are successively aligned with the barrel of the firearm during each firing cycle. There are two general types of revolvers: single-action and double-action. To fire a single-action revolver, the hammer is pulled back to cock the firearm and align the cylinder before the trigger is pulled. To fire a double-action revolver, a single trigger pull advances the cylinder as it cocks and releases the hammer. A pistol is a handgun in which the ammunition chamber is an integral part of the barrel and which is fed ammunition from a magazine contained in the grip. The firing cycle ejects the spent casings and loads a new round into the chamber. 
 We have long been known as an innovator and leader in the revolver market, and most of our revolvers are currently marketed under the Smith & Wesson brand. We sell a wide range of sizes from small-frame revolvers used primarily for concealed carry and personal protection to large-frame revolvers used primarily for recreational and competitive sport shooting. Our extra-large frame revolvers primarily address the handgun-hunting market. 
 Our small-frame revolvers have been carried by law enforcement personnel and personal defense-minded citizens for 167 years. We hold a number of patents on various firearm applications, including the use of scandium, a material that possesses many of the same attributes as titanium but at a more reasonable cost. Our revolvers are available in a variety of models and calibers, with applications in virtually all professional and consumer markets. 
 We offer pistols under our Smith & Wesson, M&P, and Performance Center brands. Our full size and compact M&P pistol products have been engineered with input from professional users and are designed to offer performance, safety, and durability that meet the standards of global law enforcement and military personnel, as well as features attractive to consumers. We believe that our M&P branded pistol products are the most ergonomic, feature-rich, and innovative products on the market today. Our range of full size and compact M&P pistol products are made with a polymer frame, a rigid stainless steel chassis, and a black, through-hardened corrosion resistant finished stainless steel barrel and slide for durability. Our M&P pistol products feature patented and easily changed palmswell grips in three or four sizes, allowing the user to customize grips in a matter of seconds; a passive trigger safety to prevent the pistol from firing if dropped; an enlarged trigger guard to accommodate gloved hands; a sear lever release that eliminates the need to press the trigger in order to disassemble the firearm; an ambidextrous slide stop and reversible magazine release to accommodate right- and left-handed shooters; an optional internal locking system and magazine safety; and a universal equipment rail to allow the addition of accessories, including lights and lasers. 
 In fiscal 2012, we launched the M&P Shield pistol to address the growing personal protection and concealed carry market. The M&P Shield features a slim concealable profile, 9mm, 380 Auto, 40 S&W, and 45 Auto calibers, and M&P ergonomics. We introduced additional M&P Shield models during fiscal 2019. We believe the M&P Shield pistol is one of the most popular firearms in the market, having surpassed the three millionth unit shipped in fiscal 2019. 
 Our Performance Center has been providing specialized products and services for the most demanding shooting sports enthusiasts since 1990. To meet the requirements of law enforcement professionals, competitive shooters, collectors, and discriminating sport enthusiasts who demand superior firearm products, our Performance Center personnel conceptualize, engineer, and craft firearm products to create enhanced versions of our standard products. Our craftsmen, many of whom are actively involved in competitive shooting, are highly skilled and experienced gunsmiths. Performance Center products are offered under the Smith & Wesson, M&P, and Thompson/Center brands and are typically made in limited production quantities, although we offer a number of catalog variations in order to increase product availability. 
 Our “Classics” department makes it possible to own historic firearms that are manufactured today but modeled after original favorites, such as the Model 29, the firearm made famous by the movie character Dirty Harry. These firearms are newly crafted with designs that take advantage of some of the most famous and collectible guns that we have ever made. Our Classics department also makes commemorative firearms and employs master engravers to craft one-of-a-kind custom firearms. These custom-made applications reflect the skill and vision of the master engraver and the artistic expression of the owner. We offer a number of catalog variations of Classics and engraved Classics to our customers.

Long Guns 
 Our M&P branded modern sporting rifles are designed to satisfy the functionality and reliability needs of global military, law enforcement, and security personnel. These long guns are popular with consumers as hunting and sporting target rifles and are sold through our sporting good distributors, retailers, and dealers. We offer M&P modern sporting rifles in five different calibers (22LR, 5.56mm NATO (223), 300 Whisper, 308 Winchester (7.62x51mm), and 6.5 Creedmoor) for multiple recreational and professional uses. We also offer upper assemblies so gun owners can easily modify their M&P to suit the needs and tasks of the various forms of sport shooting and hunting. Our broad product portfolio of modern sporting rifles includes a 22 caliber model, an opening price-point sport model, a hunting caliber model for longer range effectiveness, and several models designed for the exclusive use of military and law enforcement agencies throughout the world. 
 We manufacture three lines of bolt-action rifles under our Thompson/Center Arms brand with several models in each line. These long guns are offered in over 10 different calibers. Bolt-action rifles operate by the cycling of a bolt handle that allows for both the loading and unloading of rounds via a magazine fed system. This design allows for multi-round capacity and a level of strength that supports larger calibers. Our bolt-action rifles feature 5R rifling and a minute of angle guarantee. We offer compact rifles for shooters of smaller stature. Bolt-action rifles are the most popular firearm among hunters because of their reputation for accuracy, reliability, and relatively light-weight design. 
 Under our Thompson/Center Arms brand, we also offer four lines of high-quality American-made single-shot “black powder,” or “muzzleloader,” firearms. Ammunition for our black powder firearms is loaded through the muzzle rather than the breech, as is the case with conventional firearms. Our black powder firearms are highly accurate, dependable rifles configured with muzzleloading barrels for hunting. Black powder firearms are purchased by hunting enthusiasts, primarily for use during exclusive black powder hunting seasons for hunting big game, such as deer and elk. 
 We offer two models of interchangeable, single-shot firearm systems that deliver numerous gun, barrel, and caliber configurations, and finishes. These firearm systems can be purchased fully assembled or as frame assemblies that can be configured by the owner as a center-fire rifle, rim-fire rifle, shotgun, black powder firearm, or single-shot handgun for use across the entire range of big- and small-game hunting. As a result, a firearm owner can easily change barrels, stocks, and forends, resulting in “one gun for all seasons” that can be continuously modified to suit the needs and tasks of the owner for various forms of sport shooting and hunting. 
 Other Products and Manufacturing Services 
 Our other products and manufacturing services in the firearms segment include the following: 
 Parts: We sell parts to support our firearm business, including barrels and magazines that are manufactured at our facilities or purchased through third parties. 
 Handcuffs: We are one of the largest manufacturers of handcuffs and restraints in the United States. We fabricate these products from the highest-grade carbon or stainless steel. Our patented Lever Lock cuffs offer a double-locking system for added security and comfort, without extra tools or keys.

We have the ability to customize handcuffs to fit customer specifications. 
 Smith & Wesson Academy: The Smith & Wesson Academy offers state-of-the-art-instruction designed to meet the training needs of law enforcement and security customers worldwide. This service-only offering sends instructors to provide courses and training to law enforcement and military personnel at their locations in the field.

Our Gemtech branded suppressors were the first to market in 1976 and have been involved in setting standards used by the military in suppressor testing, implementation, and safety. Our suppressors are constructed from high grade aluminum, steel, or titanium and are compatible with every major type of rimfire and centerfire pistol and centerfire rifle caliber currently on the market.

Manufacturing Services: We utilize our substantial manufacturing capabilities to provide services to third-party customers. Our manufacturing services include forging, heat treating, rapid prototyping, tooling, finishing, plating, machining, and custom plastic injection molding. We believe our manufacturing services provide us with increased flexibility and reduced supply chain risk. We also believe that business-to-business sales provide profitable revenue stream diversification and enable us to maximize capacity utilization of our manufacturing assets. We market our manufacturing services division under the Smith & Wesson Precision Components brand name. 
 
Outdoor Products & Accessories
 We are a provider of outdoor products and accessories used in the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets. We design, source, distribute, and manufacture innovative, high-quality products under 20 brand names.
 Our extensive array of products include shooting and field rests, reloading products, gunsmithing tools, knives and cutting tools, fishing gear, gun vises, laser sighting products, optics, and tactical lighting systems, hearing protection, camping and survival gear, and vault accessories. Since 2011, we have introduced over 1,500 variations of outdoor products and accessories products and we currently hold more than 224 patents.
 Some notable products that we introduced in fiscal 2019 include the Caldwell Hydrosled, the Frankford M-Press, and the BOG Deathgrip, as well as a new line of Crimson Trace branded sights and scopes. We have grown our Outdoor Products & Accessories business inorganically through strategic acquisitions and sustained organic growth to foster meaningful new product introductions each year. Our portfolio includes highly regarded brands such as the Caldwell line of shooting supplies, which has provided shooting accessories for more than 20 years, and Crimson Trace, which has provided laser lighting systems for nearly 25 years. We also sell products under other brand names, including Wheeler, Tipton, Frankford Arsenal, Schrade, Imperial, Uncle Henry, BUBBA, UST, Lockdown, Hooyman, BOG, Old Timer, LaserLyte, and KeyGear. Finally, several of the registered trademarks in our firearm business, including the S&W logo, the script “Smith & Wesson”, the “M&P” logo, the script “Thompson/Center Arms”, and the script “Performance Center” are well known and have a reputation for quality, value, and trustworthiness in the accessories industry. As a result of the sourcing and development skills of the Outdoor Products & Accessories division, we have reduced our licensing activity and are internally developing and marketing products featuring those strong brands. In addition, our brand lane structure enables us to focus on modernizing and upgrading our brands through initiatives developed by our internal marketing, sales, and e-commerce teams.
 As noted above, we have built Outdoor Products & Accessories both organically and inorganically. In fiscal 2015, we acquired BTI, a leading provider of hunting and shooting accessories, in order to expand our presence in the firearm accessories and rugged outdoor markets and leverage BTI’s broad portfolio of hunting and shooting accessories brands that are popular with consumers. In fiscal 2017, we expanded our Outdoor Products & Accessories portfolio into the laser sighting market with the acquisition of Crimson Trace Corporation. Crimson Trace, based in Wilsonville, Oregon, is a leader in laser sighting and tactical lighting systems and an important supplier to our firearm business. In addition, in fiscal 2017, we expanded our Outdoor Products & Accessories portfolio by acquiring the net assets of Taylor Brands, LLC and Ultimate Survival Technologies, Inc. Taylor Brands, LLC which has been integrated into our BTI business and operates from Columbia, Missouri, is a leading provider of high-quality knives, specialty tools, and accessories. Ultimate Survival Technologies, Inc., based in Jacksonville, Florida, now operating as Ultimate Survival Technologies, LLC, or UST, is a provider of high-quality survival and camping equipment, including LED lights, all-weather fire starters, unbreakable signal mirrors, premium outdoor cutting tools, first aid kits, survival kits, and camp kitchen products. In fiscal 2018, we purchased Bubba Blade branded products, a provider of premium branded sports knives and tools for fishing and hunting. In fiscal 2019, we further expanded our Outdoor Products & Accessories portfolio by acquiring LaserLyte branded products, which includes laser training and sighting products for the consumer market.
 Unlike our firearm business, which is a manufacturing and sales operation, our principal Outdoor Products & Accessories business model is to design, source, distribute, and produce products focusing on product innovation and highly efficient component-level overseas sourcing. We maintain long-term relationships with key industry accounts and utilize a highly efficient digital advertising and marketing approach. We typically launch well over 150 new outdoor products and accessories SKUs every year.

Outdoor Products & Accessories net sales were $159.8 million, or 25.0%, of total net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019; $157.9 million, or 26.0%, of total net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2018; and $130.2 million, or 14.4%, of total net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017. Results reported include net sales related to acquisitions for the period subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Our Outdoor Products & Accessories gross profit for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 totaled $73.4 million, $72.5 million, and $60.7 million, respectively. Total assets for our Outdoor Products & Accessories business totaled $377.1 million and $398.5 million as of April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
Marketing, Sales, and Distribution 
 General 
 We go to market in a variety of ways, including two-step distribution, strategic retailers, and buying groups consisting of certain large, regional retailers, utilizing a combination of direct sales and sales representatives to service these customers. We also sell firearms directly to law enforcement agencies and manufacturing services directly to other businesses. In Outdoor Products & Accessories, we also go to market utilizing strategic and online retailers and direct-to-dealer sales utilizing a combination of direct sales and sales representatives. We sell internationally primarily through distributors, which in turn sell to retail stores and government agencies. Our top five commercial distributors in the United States accounted for a total of 30.3% and 38.7%, of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Those commercial distributors are not regionally exclusive and have many of the same dealer customers. Therefore, we believe that the loss of one or more of these distributors would not materially impact sales as the remaining distributors would be allocated additional sales. 
 We market our products to consumers through independent dealers, large retailers, in-store retail channels, direct to consumer, and range operations using focused marketing and promotional campaigns, which include print, broadcast, and digital advertising campaigns; social and electronic media; and in-store retail merchandising strategies. We are prominently featured in vertical print media, including editorial coverage in an extensive list of leading firearms and outdoor magazines, including Guns & Ammo, American Rifleman, Shooting Times, American Handgunner, Shooting Illustrated, American Hunter, Outdoor Life, and Field & Stream. We also sponsor many outdoor television, internet, and online programs that generate significant editorial exposure. 
 We sponsor a number of firearm safety, shooting, and hunting events and organizations. We print various product catalogs that are distributed to our dealers and mailed directly, on a limited basis, to consumers. We also attend various trade shows, such as the Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show, the NRA Annual Meeting & Exhibits, the National Association of Sporting Goods Wholesalers Show, the International Association of Chiefs of Police Show, the Association of the United States Army Show, or AUSA Show, the International Weapons Exhibition Show, or IWA Show, in Europe, and various distributor, buying group, and consumer shows. 
 For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, advertising and promotion expenses were $24.3 million, $25.8 million, and $22.3 million, respectively, excluding the cost of rebates and promotions reflected in gross profit. The increase in advertising and promotion expenses was due to the businesses acquired in fiscal year 2018. 
 We sell our products worldwide. International sales accounted for 5%, 5%, and 3% of our net sales for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Our businesses own tooling that is located at various suppliers in Asia and North America.

Digital Marketing 
 We utilize our websites, including, www.aob.com, www.smith-wesson.com, www.tcarms.com, www.btibrands.com, www.crimsontrace.com, www.ustbrands.com, and www.gemtech.com, to market our products and services and to provide a wide range of information regarding our company to customers, consumers, dealers, distributors, investors, and government and law enforcement agencies worldwide. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Twitter are effective ways for us to communicate the features and benefits of our products. Our direct to consumer e-mail marketing helps us to further engage our consumers and communicate the value of our brands. We continue to invest in new digital marketing capabilities designed by our e-commerce team to provide best-in-class customer experiences. Utilizing our digital platform, we operate branded e-commerce websites designed to inform, inspire, and prepare our customers for the rugged outdoors. We believe our digital platform supports future sales growth and profitability.  
Retail 
 We operate online retail stores from which we sell hunting, camping, and shooting accessories under all of our brands. Firearms are not sold through our online retail stores. 
Service and Support 
 We utilize a variety of methods for supporting our consumers and dealers for our Firearms division. We have a toll-free customer service number, e-mail, and social media messaging to answer questions and resolve issues regarding our firearm products. In addition, we offer a limited one-year warranty program and a lifetime service policy under which we repair defects in material or workmanship in our firearm products without charge for as long as the original purchaser owns the firearm. We also maintain a number of authorized warranty centers throughout the world and provide both warranty and charge repair services at our facilities.
 We utilize a toll-free customer service number to answer questions and resolve issues regarding our Outdoor Products & Accessories division.  We offer a limited one-year, three-year, limited-lifetime, or full-lifetime warranty program to the original purchaser of our outdoor products and accessories, depending on the product purchased. We also will repair or replace with an item of equivalent value, at our option, certain products or parts that are found to be defective under normal use and service, without charge during the warranty period.
 Facilities 
 We have three manufacturing facilities at which we produce our firearm products: a 575,000 square-foot facility located in Springfield, Massachusetts; a 38,000 square-foot facility located in Houlton, Maine; and a 150,000 square-foot facility located in Deep River, Connecticut. We conduct our handgun and long gun manufacturing and some of our manufacturing service activities at our Springfield facility. Our Houlton facility is a machining center only with no assembly, finishing, or small parts operations. We also produce handcuffs and other restraint devices at our Houlton facility. We use our Deep River facility for custom plastic injection molding services, rapid prototyping, and tooling. All of these facilities are ISO 9001 certified.
 We perform in our own facilities most of the machining and all of the assembly, inspection, and testing of the firearms that we sell. We produce our major firearm components utilizing computer-assisted machines. Our skilled employees use sophisticated automated testing equipment to ensure the proper functioning of our firearms. Every firearm is test fired before shipment. Our Springfield and Houlton facilities are currently operating on two shift patterns; a four shift, 168 hour per week schedule and a three shift, 120 hour per week schedule. We seek to minimize inventory costs through an integrated planning and production system. All facilities in our Firearms division operate under SAP, a fully integrated ERP system. We intend to continue investing in improving our facilities and our systems in order to increase efficiency, improve information reporting, and strengthen internal controls. 
 12



In connection with our Outdoor Products & Accessories division, we operate two facilities, each of which consists of a warehouse and connected office space: a 145,000 square-foot building in Columbia, Missouri and a 100,625 square foot building in Jacksonville, Florida. We also operate a 50,000 square-foot light manufacturing, assembly, and warehousing facility with connected office space in Wilsonville, Oregon. We source almost all of our outdoor products and accessories and component parts from third-party contract manufacturers located primarily in Asia and North America. Each of these facilities is ISO 9001 certified.
 In fiscal 2017, we announced a plan to establish a national logistics facility in Boone County, Missouri. In fiscal 2018, we broke ground on this new 633,000 square foot facility, which was completed in November 2018 and is expected to become fully operational in fiscal 2020. This logistics facility is designed to centralize the inventory management, sales, and distribution for our entire portfolio of finished products throughout our business. We expect to vacate both the 145,000 square-foot Columbia facility and the 100,625 square-foot Jacksonville facility in fiscal 2020 and centralize those operations in our Boone County facility. We plan to optimize logistics expertise and yield optimal tax efficiency, as well as to quickly harvest financial synergies from acquisitions. We also expect to yield higher inventory turns, provide better customer service, and gain the ability to support an omni-channel customer base as our company expands further into the rugged outdoor market once this facility becomes fully operational.
 Suppliers 
 We manufacture most of the components for our firearms, but purchase certain components and parts, including bolt carriers, rifle receivers, magazines, small parts, and rifle stocks, from third parties. We also purchase ammunition for product testing. Most of our major suppliers for our firearm products are U.S.-based and provide materials, components, and parts, such as steel, polymer components, and metal-injected-molded components. The costs of these materials, components, and parts are at competitive rates. We have become less dependent on any particular supplier by strategically sourcing parts and raw material from multiple suppliers based on quality, cost and risk. Whenever appropriate, critical parts and components have primary and secondary sources of supply.  We are also able to leverage our supply base to supplement our internal capacity and provide flexibility in our response to changes in market conditions. We use numerous raw materials, such as steel, wood, lead, brass, and plastics, in producing and testing our products. We have alternative sources for these raw materials. 
 Most of the major suppliers for our Outdoor Products & Accessories division products are based in Asia, although a portion of these products are produced, manufactured, and assembled in the United States. We continue to expand our supply base to maintain competitive pricing and quality standards and to be in a position to respond rapidly to changes in customer demand and market trends. For certain components, we utilize a dual sourcing supply chain to mitigate risks associated with sourcing key components from only one supplier.
 Research and Development; New Product Introductions 
 Through our advanced products engineering departments, we enhance existing products and develop new products for all our businesses. In fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, our gross spending on research activities relating to the development of new products was $12.9 million, $11.4 million, and $10.2 million, respectively. As of April 30, 2019, we had 71 employees at our various facilities engaged in ongoing research and development activities for all of our brands. 
Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights 
 We recognize the importance of innovation and protecting our intellectual property. Accordingly, we own numerous patents related to our products. We apply for patents whenever we develop innovative new products, unique designs, or processes of commercial importance. We do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single patent. 
 13



Because of the significance of our brand names, our trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and copyrights are also important to our business. We have an active global program of trademark registration, monitoring, and enforcement. We believe that our Smith & Wesson, M&P, Performance Center, Thompson/Center Arms, and Gemtech brands and our S&W monogram trademarks are known and recognized by the public worldwide and are important to our firearm business. In addition, we market our outdoor products and accessories under 20 brand names, including Caldwell, Wheeler, Tipton, Frankford Arsenal, Lockdown, Hooyman, BOG, Crimson Trace, Imperial, Schrade, Old Timer, Uncle Henry, BUBBA, LaserLyte, Smith & Wesson, M&P, Performance Center, Thompson/Center, UST, and KeyGear. We also sell outdoor products and accessories utilizing our firearm brands.   
 We intend to vigorously pursue and challenge infringements of our patents, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and copyrights, as we believe the goodwill associated with them is a cornerstone of our branding strategy. 
 Competition 
 We encounter competition in the firearms industry from both domestic and foreign manufacturers. Although some competitors manufacture a wide variety of firearms as we do, most of our competitors manufacture only certain types of firearms. We are one of the largest manufacturers of handguns, modern sporting rifles, and handcuffs in the United States and an active participant in the hunting rifle market. We compete primarily based upon innovation, quality, reliability, durability, price, performance, consumer brand awareness, and customer service and support. Our customer service organization is proactive in offering timely responses to customer inquiries. We believe we can effectively compete with all our present competitors. 
 Our primary competitors are Ruger and Taurus in the revolver market and Glock, Ruger, Sig Sauer, Springfield Armory, and Taurus in the pistol market. We compete primarily with Colt, Sig Sauer, Ruger, Remington, Savage, and Daniel Defense in the modern sporting rifle market and Browning, Remington, Ruger, Savage, CVA, and Traditions in the hunting rifle market. 
 Our competitors in the outdoor products and accessories markets are not as clearly defined as the firearms market because of the broad range of brand names and products. Our primary competitor in the outdoor products and accessories market is Vista Outdoors. Almost all other competitors are smaller private companies that directly compete with only one or two of our brands.
 Customers 
 We sell our firearm products through a variety of federally licensed distribution channels. Depending upon the product or service, our firearm customers include distributors; federal, state, and municipal law enforcement agencies and officers; government and military agencies; retailers; and consumers. Our outdoor products and accessories customers consist primarily of internet retailers, distributors, traditional retailers, and consumers. The ultimate users of our firearm and outdoor products and accessories include shooting and outdoor enthusiasts, collectors, sportsmen, competitive shooters, hunters, individuals desiring home and personal protection, law enforcement and military personnel and agencies, and other government organizations. 
 We grant payment terms to most commercial customers ranging from 30 to 90 days. However, in some instances, we provide longer payment terms, particularly as it relates to our hunting dating programs, which provides payment terms due in the fall for certain orders of hunting products received in the spring and summer. 
 During fiscal 2019, firearm sales into our professional channel accounted for 11.7% of our firearm net sales which include state and local law enforcement agencies, the federal government, and international customers. The remaining 88.3% of our firearm net sales were through federal firearm licensees to domestic consumers. Net sales for Outdoor Products & Accessories segment during fiscal 2019 were 4.2% to international customers and 95.8% to domestic customers. Our domestic net sales are made to e-commerce retailers, strategic retailers, dealers, and distributors that sell to licensed dealers that in turn sell to the end users. In some cases, we sell directly to large retailers and dealers.
 14



Governmental Regulations 
 Our firearm and suppressor business is primarily regulated by the ATF, which licenses the manufacture, sale, and import of firearms and suppressors in the United States. The ATF conducts periodic audits of our facilities that hold Federal Firearms Licenses. The U.S. Department of State currently oversees the export of articles, services, and related technical data that are designated as defense articles or defense services on the U.S. Munitions List, as set forth in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, under the Arms Export Control Act, or AECA. We are required to obtain an export license for all international shipments of items controlled under ITAR and AECA. 
 There are also various state laws, regulations, and local ordinances relating to firearm characteristics, features, and sales, as well as firearm magazine capacities. Local firearm dealers must comply with state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances pertaining to firearm, suppressor, and magazine sales within their jurisdictions. We manufacture several firearm models and magazines in various capacities that comply with those laws, regulations, and ordinances for sales in those states and localities. In Massachusetts, for example, there are regulations related to the weight of the trigger pull, barrel length, material strength, and independent testing of handguns. California, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York, as well as other states, the District of Columbia, and other localities, have similar laws, ordinances, and restrictions. In addition, California and the District of Columbia require new pistols to contain a microstamping mechanism, which must be able to etch or imprint, in two locations, a microstamp array of characters that identify the make, model, and serial number of the pistols onto each cartridge case when the pistol is fired. No commercially produced firearm has utilized the microstamping process, which is considered by most to be unfeasible, and we have no plans to utilize any microstamping feature in our firearms. Therefore, we will not sell into California or the District of Columbia any pistol that is subject to the microstamping feature requirement. 
 Warnings and instructions concerning the safe operation of our firearms and suppressors are contained in Safety & Instruction Manuals included in all boxes in which firearms and suppressors are shipped and are also available for download from our Smith & Wesson, Thompson/Center Arms, and Gemtech websites.
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regulates certain of our electro-optics products. 
 Our outdoor products and accessories business is subject to various standard business regulations of the kind that typically apply to all companies whose products are used by consumers.
 Environmental Health and Safety 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations that regulate the health and safety of our workforce, including those regulations monitored by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, or OSHA, the National Fire Protection Association, and the Department of Public Health. Though not exhaustive, examples of applicable regulations include confined space safety, walking and working surfaces, machine guarding, and life safety. 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to land, surface, subsurface strata and water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. These laws require us to make significant expenditures of both a capital and expense nature. Several of the more significant federal laws applicable to our operations include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA; and the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA. 
 We are required to remediate hazardous waste at our facilities. Currently, we own a designated site in Springfield, Massachusetts that contains two release areas, which are the focus of remediation projects as part of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan, or MCP. The MCP provides a structured environment for the voluntary remediation of regulated releases. We may be required to remove hazardous waste or remediate the alleged effects of hazardous substances on the environment associated with past disposal practices at sites not owned by us. We have received notice that we are a potentially responsible party from the Environmental Protection Agency and/or individual states under CERCLA or a state equivalent at two sites. 
 15



In our efforts to satisfy our environmental responsibilities and to comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have established, and periodically update, policies relating to the environmental standards of performance for our operations. We have in place programs that monitor compliance with various federal, state, and local environmental regulations. However, in the normal course of our manufacturing operations, we are subject to governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to waste disposal, air emissions, and water discharges from our operations into the environment. We regularly incur substantial capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws, including remediation of known environmental conditions which we fund through cash flows from operations. We spent $1.0 million in fiscal 2019 on environmental compliance, consisting of $795,000 for disposal fees and containers, $188,000 for remediation, $60,000 for DEP analysis and fees. 
 In the normal course of our business, we may become involved in various proceedings relating to environmental health and safety matters, and we are currently engaged in an environmental investigation and remediation. Our manufacturing facilities are located on properties with a long history of industrial use, including the use of hazardous substances. We have identified soil and groundwater contamination at our Springfield, Massachusetts plant that we are investigating, monitoring, or remediating, as appropriate. As of April 30, 2019, we had recorded a $725,000 environmental reserve in non-current liabilities. Our estimate of these costs is based upon currently enacted laws and regulations, currently available facts, experience in remediation efforts, existing technology, and the ability of other potentially responsible parties or contractually liable parties to pay the allocated portions of any environmental obligations. 
 When the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used; when the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. We may not have insurance coverage for our environmental remediation costs. We have not recognized any gains from probable recoveries or other gain contingencies. We calculated the environmental reserve using undiscounted amounts based on third-party independent environmental remediation reports. 
 Based on information known to us, we do not expect current environmental regulations or environmental proceedings and claims to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact on us of future environmental compliance requirements or of the cost of resolution of future environmental health and safety proceedings and claims, in part because the scope of the remedies that may be required is not certain, liability under federal environmental laws is joint and several in nature, and environmental laws and regulations are subject to modification and changes in interpretation. There can be no assurance that additional or changing environmental regulation will not become more burdensome in the future and that any such development would not have a material adverse effect on our company. 
 Employees
 As of May 31, 2019, we had 1,988 employees, including 8 part-time employees. Of these employees, 1,484 were engaged in manufacturing, 141 in sales and marketing, 50 in finance and accounting, 74 in research and development, 46 in information services, and 193 in various executive or other administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a union in collective bargaining with us. Of our employees, 24.3% have 10 or more years of service with our company and 7.2% have greater than 25 years of service with our company. We believe that our employee relations are good and that the high quality of our employee base is instrumental to our success. 
Backlog 
 As of April 30, 2019 and 2018, we had a backlog of orders for firearms totaling $39.2 million and $96.1 million, respectively. The decrease in firearms order backlog from the prior fiscal year was primarily because of the normalization of channel inventories and the timing of order fulfillment. We had a backlog of orders for our outdoor products and accessories totaling $12.7 million and $14.3 million as of April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our backlog consists of orders for which purchase orders have been received and which are generally scheduled for shipment within six months and subject to capacity constraints. We allow orders received that have not yet shipped to be cancelled; therefore, our backlog may not be indicative of future sales.
