Item 1. Business.
Overview
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company”, “Avalo” or “we”) is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment of immune dysregulation by developing therapies that target the LIGHT-signaling network. 
LIGHT (Lymphotoxin-like, exhibits Inducible expression, and competes with HSV Glycoprotein D for Herpesvirus Entry Mediator (“HVEM”), a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes; also referred to as TNFSF14) is an immunoregulatory cytokine. LIGHT and its signaling receptors, HVEM (TNFRSF14), and lymphotoxin β receptor (TNFRSF3), form an immune regulatory network with two co-receptors of herpesvirus entry mediator, checkpoint inhibitor B and T Lymphocyte Attenuator (“BTLA”), and CD160 (collectively, the “LIGHT-signaling network” or the “LIGHT network”). Accumulating evidence points to the dysregulation of the LIGHT-signaling network as a disease-driving mechanism in autoimmune and inflammatory reactions in barrier organs. Therefore, we believe reducing LIGHT levels can moderate immune dysregulation in many acute and chronic inflammatory disorders.
Avalo was incorporated in Delaware and commenced operation in 2011, and completed its initial public offering in October 2015. 
Our Strategy
Our strategy for increasing stockholder value includes: 
•Advancing our pipeline of compounds through development and to regulatory approval; 
•Developing the go-to-market strategy to quickly and effectively market, launch, and distribute each of our compounds that receive regulatory approval;
•Opportunistically out-licensing rights to indications or geographies; and
•Acquiring or licensing rights to targeted, complementary differentiated preclinical and clinical stage compounds.
Pipeline — Overview, Competition and Intellectual Property
The following chart summarizes key information about our pipeline and is followed by further detail for each program, including an overview, competition, licenses (if applicable), and market, data, and patent exclusivity/intellectual property:
Core Programs: Immune Dysregulation Disorders
AVTX-002: Anti-LIGHT monoclonal antibody for treatment of Non-Eosinophilic Asthma.
Overview: AVTX-002 is a fully human mAb, directed against human LIGHT. There is increasing evidence that the dysregulation of the LIGHT-signaling network which includes LIGHT, its receptor HVEM and LTβR and the downstream checkpoint BTLA, is a disease-driving mechanism in autoimmune and inflammatory reactions in barrier organs. Therefore, Avalo believes reducing LIGHT levels can moderate immune dysregulation in many acute and chronic inflammatory disorders.
Avalo is currently developing AVTX-002 for the treatment of non-eosinophilic asthma (“NEA”). Our Phase 2 PEAK Trial (A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of AVTX-002 for the treatment of Poorly Controlled Non-Eosinophilic Asthma K) is fully enrolled and we expect to release topline data in the second quarter of 2023. 
AVTX-002 previously demonstrated proof-of-concept in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”) including reduction in mortality and respiratory failure. AVTX-002 also showed clinically meaningful mucosal healing in a Phase 1b study in Crohn’s Disease. Avalo will assess the next stage of development for these indications, as well as potentially other acute and inflammatory disorders, upon or close to the data readout of the PEAK Trial in NEA. 
About Non-Eosinophilic Asthma: Asthma is a chronic disease of the lungs characterized by airway inflammation causing swelling and excess mucous production. Approximately 25 million people in the United States suffer from asthma. Asthma is classified as eosinophilic or non-eosinophilic, with approximately 50% of severe asthma cases related to NEA. NEA is characterized by airway inflammation with the absence of eosinophils. NEA is associated with environmental and/or host factors such as smoking cigarettes, pollution, infections and obesity. Patients present with respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, cough and chest tightness. Many patients respond suboptimally to standard asthma treatments, especially to inhaled corticosteroids, which can lead to a higher severity of disease and more difficult-to-control asthma. 
Competition: To our knowledge, AVTX-002 is one of two anti-LIGHT mAb in clinical development in the United States. As of the date of this report, there are no FDA approved therapies specifically for NEA; however, Tezspire® (thymic stromal lymphopoietin blocker) was approved in December 2021 for the add-on maintenance treatment of severe asthma in a broad population with no phenotype of biomarker limitations.
License: On March 25, 2021, the Company entered into a license agreement with Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. (“KKC”) for exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize AVTX-002 for all indications (the “KKC License Agreement”). The KKC License Agreement replaced the Amended and Restated Clinical Development and Option Agreement between the Company and KKC dated May 28, 2020.
Under the KKC License Agreement, the Company paid KKC an upfront license fee of $10 million. Avalo is also required to pay KKC up to an aggregate of $112.5 million based on the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones. Upon commercialization, the Company is required to pay KKC sales-based milestones aggregating up to $75 million tied to the achievement of annual net sales targets.
Additionally, the Company is required to pay KKC royalties during a country-by-country royalty term equal to a mid-teen percentage of annual net sales. The Company is required to pay KKC a double-digit percentage (less than 30%) of the payments that the Company receives from sublicensing of its rights under the KKC License Agreement, subject to certain exclusions. Avalo is responsible for the development and commercialization of AVTX-002 in all indications worldwide (other than the option in the KKC License Agreement that, upon exercise by KKC, allows KKC to develop, manufacture and commercialize AVTX-002 in Japan). In addition to the KKC License Agreement, Avalo is subject to additional royalties upon commercialization of up to an amount of less than 10% of net sales. 
Market, Data, and Patent Exclusivity: Patents exclusively licensed from KKC may provide exclusivity in the United States through 2028 absent any extension, and additional patent applications filed by us covering certain methods of using AVTX-002, if issued and properly maintained, should provide additional exclusivity through 2043, absent any extension. Additionally, if we receive marketing approval, we expect to receive biologics data exclusivity in the United States, which would provide twelve years of data exclusivity in the United States from the date of FDA approval.
AVTX-008: Fully human B and T Lymphocyte Attenuator (BTLA) agonist fusion protein.
Overview: AVTX-008 is a fully human BTLA agonist fusion protein.
Avalo has identified a lead molecule and is currently evaluating several immune dysregulation disorders to pursue. Avalo has initiated activities for the preparation of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), with a target IND submission date in 2024.

Competition: To our knowledge, the treatment of autoimmune diseases with BTLA agonists include LY3361237 (Eli Lilly and Company), MB272 (Gilead Sciences, Inc.), ANB032 (AnaptysBio, Inc.) and HFB200604 AID (HiFiBiO Therapeutics).
License: On June 21, 2021, the Company entered into an Exclusive Patent License Agreement with Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute (the “Sanford Burnham Prebys License Agreement” or the “SBP License Agreement”) under which Avalo obtained an exclusive license to a portfolio of issued patents and patent applications covering AVTX-008. 
Under the Sanford Burnham Prebys License Agreement, Avalo paid a mid-six digit upfront license fee and pays mid-five digit annual maintenance fees. Avalo is also required to pay Sanford Burnham Prebys up to approximately $24 million based on the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones. Upon commercialization, the Company is required to pay Sanford Burnham Prebys sales-based milestones aggregating up to $50 million tied to the achievement of annual net sales targets. Additionally, the Company is required to pay Sanford Burnham Prebys royalties during a country-by-country royalty term equal to a low-to-mid single digit percentage of annual net sales. Avalo is also required to pay Sanford Burnham Prebys a tiered low-double digit percentage of payments that Avalo receives from sublicensing of its rights under the Sanford Burnham Prebys License Agreement, subject to certain exclusions. Avalo is responsible for the development and commercialization of the program. 
Market, Data, and Patent Exclusivity: Patents exclusively licensed from Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discover Institute may provide exclusivity in the United States through 2036 absent any extension. Additionally, if we receive marketing approval, we expect to receive biologics data exclusivity in the United States, which may provide twelve years of data exclusivity in the United States from the date of FDA approval.
Other
AVTX-803: Monosaccharide therapy for treatment of Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type II.
Overview: AVTX-803 is a fucose replacement for leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (“LAD II”, also known as SLC35C1-CDG). LAD II is a congenital disorder of glycosylation (“CDG”). Oral administration of AVTX-803 replenishes critical metabolic intermediates that are reduced or absent due to genetic mutations, overcoming single enzyme defects in respective CDGs to support glycoprotein synthesis, maintenance and function. 
The pivotal LADDER Trial (A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Two-Period, Crossover, Withdrawal Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of AVTX-803 in Subjects with Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type II (LADD) (ER)) is currently ongoing. 
About LAD II: LAD II is an ultra-rare, inherited CDG, previously known as CDG-IIc and is also referred to as SLC35C1-CDG. The disease is autosomal recessive and is characterized by reduced or absent fucosylation of certain glycoproteins. Patients with LAD II present with a multi-system phenotype that may include: leukocytosis, neutrophilia, recurrent infections, reduced selectin expression and binding, Bombay blood group, hypotonia, poor feeding, short stature, coarse facial features, global development delay and psychomotor retardation. In some cases, these symptoms lead to death, and in most LAD II patients, the disorder negatively impacts quality of life.
Designations of AVTX-803 Program: 
•Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”), the benefit of which, amongst other things, is a seven-year marketing exclusivity (upon approval) in the United States;
•Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (“RPDD”), which may qualify us to receive a priority review voucher (“PRV”) upon FDA approval of each compound. If received, each PRV, which may be sold and transferred an unlimited amount of times, can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent new drug application (“NDA”) or biologics license application (“BLA”); and
•Fast Track Designation (“FTD”), which features actions to expedite the development of drugs that target a serious condition and address an unmet medical need including eligibility for expedited review and rolling review of each NDA or BLA by the FDA.
Competition: As of the date of this report, there are no FDA approved treatments for the treatment of CDGs (including LAD II), however dietary monosaccharide formulations have been shown to alleviate several of the clinical manifestations in CDG patients.
AVTX-803 is an ultra‑pure formulation of L-fucose. This formulation consists of a naturally occurring substance contained in various foods, including dairy products and fruit.
Intellectual Property: AVTX-803 was granted ODD by the FDA. As a result, at a minimum, following marketing approval, we plan to rely on seven-year marketing exclusivity in the United States. 
Legacy Programs
Due to our focus on AVTX-002, AVTX-008 and AVTX-803, we are not currently actively pursuing the development of the following programs and are exploring strategic alternatives:
AVTX-006: AVTX-006 is a dual mTORc1/c2 small molecule inhibitor for the treatment of complex lymphatic malformations.
AVTX-801: AVTX-801 is a D-galactose substrate replacement therapy for the treatment of phosphoglucomutase 1 (“PGM1”) deficiency, also known as PGM1-CDG.
AVTX-802: AVTX-802 is a D-mannose substrate replacement therapy for the treatment of Mannose Phosphate Isomerase (“MPI”) deficiency, also known as MPI-CDG. 
AVTX-913: AVTX-913 is a nucleotide prodrug for the treatment of a mitochondrial disorder and is a preclinical asset.
Intellectual Property Overview
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for the technology and know-how upon which our products are based, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights.
We hold ownership, trademark rights and/or exclusivity to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates covered by patents and patent applications. Our portfolio of patents includes patents or patent applications with claims directed to compositions of matter, including compounds, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, methods of manufacturing the compounds, or a combination of these claims. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of a compound for a specific indication, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Similar extensions to patent term may be available in other countries for particular patents in our portfolio. 
We plan to augment our portfolio of compounds by focusing on the development (when possible) of new chemical entities (“NCEs”) or biologics, which have not previously received FDA approval. Upon approval by the FDA, NCEs are entitled to market and data exclusivity in the United States with respect to generic drug competition for a period of five years from the date of FDA approval, even if the related patents have expired. Similarly, upon approval by the FDA, biologics are entitled to reference product exclusivity for a period of twelve years from the date of FDA approval, even if the related patents have expired.
Intellectual property for specific pipeline assets, if applicable, are discussed above within the “Pipeline Assets” section. 
Competition Overview
We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies, both in the United States and abroad. We compete, or will compete, with existing and new products being developed by our competitors. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that our research and development programs target or might target. Some of these competitors also have greater resources and more experience than we do in regulatory development and marketing.
Competition for specific pipeline assets are discussed above within the “Pipeline Assets” section. 
Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We rely on contract manufacturing organizations to produce our drug candidates in accordance with applicable provisions of the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) regulations for use in our clinical studies. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control.
Sales and Marketing
For our clinical stage pipeline assets, we may retain or partner in the United States with third parties on the commercialization rights and develop sales and marketing capabilities when needed. If we develop our own United States sales force we may complement it with co‑promotion agreements with partners in and outside the United States. We may also seek to commercialize any of our approved products outside of the United States and may do so either through an expansion of our sales force or through collaboration with third parties. 
Overall Competitive Climate and Risks
Other competitors may have a variety of drugs in development or may be awaiting FDA approval that could reach the market and become established before we have an approved product to sell. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could limit the market for any approved drugs that we may develop. Many of our competitors are using technologies or methods different or similar to ours to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small compound drugs. Many of our competitors and their collaborators may have significantly greater experience than we do in the following:
•identifying and validating targets;
•screening compounds against targets;
•preclinical and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products; and
•obtaining FDA and other regulatory clearances.
In addition, many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater advantages in the following areas:
•capital resources;
•research and development resources; 
•manufacturing capabilities; and
•sales and marketing resources.
Smaller companies might also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. 
Many of our competitors have products that have been approved or are in advanced development. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, may succeed in developing technologies or drugs that are more effective, safer, and more affordable or more easily administered than ours and may achieve patent protection or commercialize drugs sooner than us. Developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export, pricing, and government contracting related to pharmaceutical products such as those we sell and are developing. 
United States Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after 
approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, or other actions, such as the FDA’s delay in review of or refusal to approve a pending NDA or BLA, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or study termination, issuance of Warning Letters or Untitled Letters, mandated modifications to promotional materials or issuance of corrective information, requests for product recalls, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow product import or export, total or partial suspension of or restriction of or imposition of other requirements relating to production or distribution, injunctions, fines, debarment from government contracts and refusal of future orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, FDA debarment, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.
FDA Marketing Approval
Obtaining FDA marketing approval for new products may take many years and require the expenditure of substantial financial resources. In order for the FDA to determine that a product is safe and effective for the proposed indication, the product must first undergo testing in animals (nonclinical studies). The data generated from nonclinical studies is used to support the filing of an IND under which human studies are conducted. Human testing is generally conducted under an IND in three phases following Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) regulations:
•Phase 1 studies evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug, generally in normal, healthy volunteers;
•Phase 2 studies evaluate safety and efficacy, as well as appropriate doses; these studies are typically conducted in patient volunteers who suffer from the particular disease condition that the drug is designed to treat; and
•Phase 3 studies evaluate safety and efficacy of the product at specific doses in one or more larger pivotal trials. 
In addition to human testing, the manufacturing process of the potential product must be developed in accordance with cGMP regulations. Prior to the approval of a new product, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the proposed drug product is manufactured to ensure cGMP compliance.
The cumulative safety and efficacy data generated from the clinical trials described above, chemistry, manufacturing and control (“CMC”) information, nonclinical study data and proposed labeling are used as the basis to support approval of a marketing application (NDA or BLA) to the FDA. The preparation of an NDA or BLA requires the expenditure of substantial funds and the commitment of substantial resources. Additionally, at the time of an NDA or BLA submission a user fee is required (unless the product has ODD) to be paid. The FDA conducts a preliminary administrative review upon receipt of the NDA or BLA submission, the FDA either accepts the NDA or BLA submission or does not. If the application is not accepted for review by FDA, the Sponsor of the application must resolve the deficiencies and re-submit the application, re-starting the review clock.
After evaluating the NDA or BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter (“CRL”). A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA and may require additional clinical or preclinical studies, or other information, in order for FDA approval. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
The development and approval of new drugs requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Data obtained from the development program are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations. These instances may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the product. 
FDA Post‑Approval Considerations 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, manufacturing, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product and drug shortages. During the approval process, the FDA and the sponsor may agree that specific studies or clinical trials should be conducted as post-
marketing commitments, but they are not required. The FDA may also impose post-marketing requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance, to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product becomes available in the market.
After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as manufacturing changes and adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to FDA review and approval. There are also annual user fee requirements for any marketed product and new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Additionally, the FDA strictly regulates the labeling, advertising and promotion of products under an approved NDA or BLA. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly marketed or promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability, including criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, debarment from government contracts, refusal of future orders under existing contracts and mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements or deferred prosecution agreements.
Other Regulations of the Healthcare Industry
In addition to FDA regulations governing the marketing of pharmaceutical products, there are various other state and federal laws that may restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These include the following:
•The federal Anti-Kickback laws and implementing regulations, which prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
•Other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions and policies that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by our customers, including the amount of such payment;
•The federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government;
•The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits certain payments made to foreign government officials;
•State and foreign law equivalents of the foregoing and state laws regarding pharmaceutical company marketing compliance, reporting and disclosure obligations; 
•The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA”), which among other things: changes access to healthcare products and services; creates new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries; changes rebates and prices for health care products and services; and requires additional reporting and disclosure; 
•The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”), which creates federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and which also imposes certain obligations on entities with respect to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
•The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and public reporting of the payment data.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti‑fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. This is currently not applicable as our only approved product is not currently sold in a foreign country.
Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third‑party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our therapeutic product candidates. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third‑party payers are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage, attempting to limit reimbursement levels or regulate the price of drugs and other medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. For example, in the United States, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. Federal programs also impose price controls through mandatory ceiling prices on purchases by federal agencies and federally funded hospitals and clinics and mandatory rebates on retail pharmacy prescriptions paid by Medicaid and Tricare. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. Moreover, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payers and other governmental payers develop their coverage and reimbursement policies.
In addition, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, competition within therapeutic classes, availability of generic equivalents, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. The cost containment measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved products. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third‑party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our approved products in whole or in part.
Healthcare Reform 
The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. 
In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. Further, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. 
The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Since its passage, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the ACA. 
The Trump administration pushed for modifications to the ACA. In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “IRC”), as amended, commonly referred to as the individual mandate. While the Biden administration has rolled back many of the executive orders issued by former President Trump and has stated that it intends to build on the ACA and to expand coverage thereunder, ongoing repeal and reform efforts impacting the ACA and the healthcare sector more broadly are likely.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the ACA. These have, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers.
Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible. The Biden administration has signaled that it plans to build on the ACA and expand the number of people who are eligible for subsidies under it. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, enacted on August 16, 2022, includes several provision to lower prescription drug costs for Medicare patients and reduce drug spending by the federal government. It is unknown what form any future changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry. In addition, the Affordable Care Act has also been subject to challenges in the courts, which remain ongoing. 
Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives as well. In addition, at the state level, legislatures have passed and may pass legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
Hatch‑Waxman Patent Exclusivity
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or 505(b)(2) NDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to provide a certification to the FDA in the product application concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
•the required patent information has not been filed;
•the listed patent has expired;
•the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
•the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product.
Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent or if the listed patent is a patented method of use for which approval is not being sought. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, 
expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant or other period determined by a court.
Hatch‑Waxman Non‑Patent Exclusivity
Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five‑year period of non‑patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non‑infringement.
The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA, if new clinical investigations other than bioavailability studies that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three‑year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three‑year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five‑year and three‑year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Approval of Biosimilars and Biologic Exclusivity
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), which was enacted as part of the ACA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed reference biological product via an approved BLA. Biosimilarity to an approved reference product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity is demonstrated in steps beginning with rigorous analytical studies or “fingerprinting”, in vitro studies, in vivo animal studies, and generally at least one clinical study, absent a waiver from the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The biosimilarity exercise tests the hypothesis that the investigational product and the reference product are the same. If at any point in the stepwise biosimilarity process a significant difference is observed, then the products are not biosimilar, and the product will have to developed and approved using a traditional NDA or BLA. In order to meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. 
Upon approval of a BLA, the biologic is listed in the Purple Book along with the date it was licensed; whether the biological product licensed has been determined by the FDA to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference biological product (an already-licensed FDA biological product) and the date of expiration of applicable exclusivity. Under the BPCIA, a reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. This 12-year period includes 4 years before the FDA may accept for filing an application for a biologic that references a branded (reference) product.
Pediatric Exclusivity.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non‑patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non‑patent exclusivity period described above. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity. 
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or affecting more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug available in the United States will be recovered from United States sales. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation if there is a drug already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same drug as the already approved drug. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user‑fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is generally entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. 
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation
Under Section 529 to the FDCA, the FDA will award Priority Review Vouchers (“PRVs”) to sponsors for rare pediatric disease product applications that meet certain criteria. Under this program, a sponsor who receives approval for a drug or biologic for a rare pediatric disease may qualify for a PRV that can be redeemed to receive a PRV of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The PRV may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Under the PRV program, any drug that is granted RPDD by September 30, 2024 and receives approval by September 30, 2026 may qualify for a PRV. 
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding drug development, approval and commercialization. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
European Union Drug Approval Process
To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit marketing authorization applications (“MAAs”) either under the so‑called centralized, decentralized, mutual recognition or national authorization procedures.
Centralized procedure
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) that is valid in all European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health.
National authorization procedures
There are also three other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure.
•National authorization procedure. This procedure involves submitting an MAA to an individual EU country’s competent authority for approval. Each EU Member State has its own national authorization procedures.
•Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
•Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten‑year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Commercially Marketed Product
The Company currently has one marketed product, Millipred®, an oral prednisolone indicated across a wide variety of inflammatory conditions and indications. Prednisolone is a man-made form of a natural substance (corticosteroid hormone) made by the adrenal gland. It is used to treat conditions such as arthritis, blood disorders, immune system disorders, skin and eye conditions, respiratory disorders, cancer, and severe allergies. Prednisolone decreases an individual's immune response to various diseases to reduce symptoms such as pain, swelling and allergic-type reactions. Millipred® is supplied in 5mg tablets.

Millipred® tablets primarily compete in the generic prednisolone market. We believe our primary point of differentiation is that we offer the lowest strength prednisolone in the marketplace allowing healthcare professionals greater flexibility when dosing a glucocorticoid steroid across a variety of pediatric and adult indications. Additionally, Millipred® utilizes the proprietary double taste-masking technology to provide a pleasant grape taste with no bitterness, which makes the product easier to administer to children. 
The Company has a license and supply agreement for the Millipred® product with a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (“Teva”), which expires on September 30, 2023.
