Recent Developments
Currently, 33 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia have passed laws permitting their citizens to use medical cannabis. Marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the “DEA”), and the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), and therefore it is illegal to grow, possess and consume cannabis under federal law. On September 27, 2018, however, the DEA announced that drugs, including “finished dosage formulations” of cannabidiol (“CBD”) and tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) below 0.1%, will be considered Schedule 5 drugs as long as the medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. THC and CBD are two natural compounds found in cannabis plants. THC is the main psychoactive compound in marijuana, while CBD is an antagonist to, and inhibits the physiological action to, THC. The CSA bans cannabis-related businesses; the possession, cultivation and production of cannabis-infused products; and the distribution of cannabis and products derived from it. Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court has confirmed that the federal government has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, including for medical purposes, and that federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis preempts state laws that legalize its use. 
 Under the Obama Administration, the DOJ previously issued memoranda, including the so-called “Cole Memo” on August 29, 2013, providing internal guidance to federal prosecutors concerning enforcement of federal cannabis prohibitions under the CSA. This guidance essentially characterized use of federal law enforcement resources to prosecute those complying with state laws allowing the use, manufacture and distribution of cannabis as an inefficient use of such federal resources when state laws and enforcement efforts are effective with respect to specific federal enforcement priorities under the CSA. 
 On January 4, 2018, then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a written memorandum rescinding the Cole Memo and related internal guidance issued by the DOJ regarding federal law enforcement priorities involving marijuana (the “Sessions Memo”). The Sessions Memo instructs federal prosecutors that when determining which marijuana-related activities to prosecute under federal law with the DOJ’s finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles set forth in the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual governing all federal prosecutions. The Sessions Memo states that “these principles require federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” The Sessions Memo went on to state that given the DOJ’s well-established general principles, “previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.”

It is unclear at this time what impact the Sessions Memo will have on the medical-use marijuana industry. In addition, pursuant to the current omnibus spending bill previously approved by Congress, the DOJ was prohibited from using funds appropriated by Congress to prevent states from implementing their medical-use cannabis laws. This provision, however, will expire on September 30, 2019. There is no assurance that Congress will approve inclusion of a similar prohibition on DOJ spending in the appropriations bill for 2019. Although we are not engaged in the purchase, sale, growth, cultivation, harvesting, or processing of medical-use marijuana products, we lease our properties to tenants who engage in such activities, and therefore strict enforcement of federal prohibitions regarding marijuana could irreparably harm our business, subject us to criminal prosecution and/or adversely affect the trading price of our securities.
 
In May 2018, we transitioned to a new and strategically important business model designed to better align our interests with those of our tenants and clients, positioning us to benefit from the growth of the medical marijuana industry.
  Under the new model, we and our primary tenants in Arizona, Broken Arrow Herbal Center, Inc. (“Broken Arrow”) and CJK, Inc., doing business as Hana Meds (“Hana Meds”), have agreed to the following:
 

● | We leased the entirety of our licensed medical marijuana facilities located in Arizona at Chino Valley, Green Valley, Tempe and Kingman to Hana Meds, with plans to further expand the developments as operational needs increase over time. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Lease terms for the New Chino Valley Lease, New Tempe Lease, New Kingman Lease and New Green Valley Lease have been extended through the year 2040. 
● | Base rent rates have been modified to be in line with industry averages beginning May 1, 2018. 
● | We and Hana Meds have entered into a long-term strategic advisory relationship, under which we will assist Hana Meds in all aspects of building and facility performance, aiming to increase efficiency, sustainability and profitability. 
● | We were to receive an advisory fee equal to 10% of gross revenues, paid monthly beginning in January 2019. 

 
Effective January 1, 2019, the Company, Christopher Carra, Alan Abrams, Clayton Abrams Revocable Trust (the “Clayton Abrams Trust”), and Kyle Abrams Revocable Trust (the “Kyle Abrams Trust” and together with the Clayton Abrams Trust, the “Trusts”) entered into a Stock Redemption Agreement (the “Stock Redemption Agreement”). Prior to entry into the Stock Redemption Agreement, (i) Mr. Carra was the owner 2,028,335 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing approximately 11.6% of the Company’s outstanding shares as of January 1, 2019, and (ii) Mr. Abrams, together with the Trusts (collectively, the “Abrams Affiliates”), owned 3,611,669 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing approximately 20.7% of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of January 1, 2019. Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) rules, each of Messrs. Carra and Abrams was deemed to be a “related person” due solely to their status as significant stockholders of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Redemption Agreement, the parties agreed that the Company would redeem an aggregate of 5,640,004 owned by Mr. Carra and the Abrams Affiliates (the “Stock Redemption”) such that Messrs. Carra and Abrams would no longer be significant and stockholders of the Company and would no longer be deemed to be “related persons” under SEC rules. In exchange for the Stock Redemption, the parties agreed that:
 

● | The Company and Broken Arrow, which is owned, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by Messrs. Abrams and Carra, amended the Broken Arrow CASA to reduce the gross revenue fee payable by Broken Arrow from 10% of gross revenue to 0% of gross revenue,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company and Hana Meds, which is owned, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by Messrs. Abrams and Carra, amended the Hana Meds CASA to reduce the gross revenue fee payable by Hana Meds from 10% of gross revenue to 0% of gross revenue,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company and Mr. Abrams amended the convertible debenture dated January 9, 2017 (the “Abrams Debenture”) to extend the maturity date of the Abrams Debenture from January 9, 2022 until January 9, 2030, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Chino Valley and Broken Arrow amended the Licensed Medical Marijuana Facility Triple Net (NNN) Lease Agreement dated May 1, 2018 (the “Chino Valley Lease”) to increase the monthly base rent payable by Broken Arrow from $35,000 to $40,000.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
2019 will be heavily focused on the growth of a diversified revenue stream. We intend to accomplish this by prospecting new advisory services across the country for private and municipal clients. We believe that strategic real estate advisory services are likely to emerge as the growth engine for Zoned Properties and are moving to take advantage of new opportunities.
 
Our Business
 
Zoned Properties is a strategic real estate development & services firm whose primary mission is to provide specialized real estate services for clients in the regulated cannabis industry, positioning the company for real estate acquisition and revenue growth. We intend to pioneer sustainable development for emerging industries, including the regulated cannabis industry. We are an accredited member of the Better Business Bureau, the U.S. Green Building Council, and the Forbes Real Estate Council. We focus on investing capital to acquire and develop commercial properties to be leased on a triple-net basis, and engaging clients that face zoning, permitting, development, and operational challenges. We provide development strategies and advisory services that could potentially have a major impact on cash flow and property value. We do not grow, harvest, sell or distribute cannabis or any substances regulated under United States law such as the Controlled Substance Act of 1970, as amended (the “CSA”).
 
We intend to develop and expand multiple business divisions, including a commercial real estate brokerage team, an advisory services division, and a nonprofit charitable organization to focus on community prosperity. Each of these operating divisions are important elements of the overall business development strategy for long-term growth. We believe in the value of building relationships with clients and local communities in order to position the company for long-term portfolio and revenue growth backed by sophisticated, safe, and sustainable assets and clients.

The core of our business involves identifying and developing properties that intend to operate within highly regulated zoning and permitting regions, including the regulated cannabis and marijuana industry. Within highly regulated industries, local municipalities typically develop strict planning and zoning regulations that dictate the specific locations at which regulated properties can operate. These regulations often complex permitting processes and can include non-standard setbacks for each location; for example, restricting a regulated property or facility from operating within a certain distance of any parks, schools, churches, or residential districts. When an organization can collaborate with local representatives, a proactive set of rules and regulations can be established and followed to meet the needs of both the regulated operators and the local community.
 
The Company currently maintains a portfolio of properties that we own, develop, and lease. We currently lease land and building space at all five of the properties in our portfolio. Four of the properties are leased to licensed medical marijuana tenants and are located in areas with established zoning and permitting procedures. Two of the leased properties are zoned and permitted as licensed medical marijuana dispensaries, and two of the leased properties are zoned and permitted as licensed medical marijuana cultivation facilities. In addition, we may provide on-going advisory services at each property that is leased to operating tenants. Each property undergoes a development life cycle. Areas of development that may require advisory services can range from initial property identification and zoning authorization to complete architectural design, utility installation, property management protocol, facilities management systems, and security system installation.
 
There are significant challenges that take place when zoning, permitting, and developing facilities specifically associated with the regulated cannabis and marijuana industry. Each state and jurisdiction may adopt specific zoning and permitting regulations. The Company has gained valuable knowledge and best practices in this area by successfully completing four major projects in the state of Arizona, a highly regulated market for licensed cannabis and marijuana operators. The Company intends to replicate this business model in other states as markets mature and rules and regulations are established.
 
The process of establishing zoning and permitting can directly impact our ability to place a licensed tenant in a long-term lease agreement. In locations where the zoning and permitting process has not been comprehensively defined, the Company may attempt to work with local representatives to collaboratively establish regulatory language to guide future developments. In locations where the zoning and permitting process may not allow for a currently feasible development, but could allow for the development to be successful in the future, the Company may hold the undeveloped property and/or lease the property out in the interim. We approach these situations on a case-by-case basis.
 
We generally confirm baseline zoning during the due diligence period and as a contingency of a prospective acquisition. Ideally, properties we consider for acquisition and subsequent development would already be zoned and permitted for use as a licensed cannabis or marijuana operation; however, we do have the expertise to address these requirements if zoning and permitting are not in place at the time of acquisition. 
 
The process for obtaining zoning authorizations and permitting for a regulated cannabis or marijuana facility can take several months to complete. The process primarily involves working directly with the local Planning and Zoning Commission or Development Department. Notwithstanding proper zoning and permitted use, we may work with local zoning authorities in order to revise zoning laws. The Company has been involved with local representatives for each of the properties currently held in our portfolio. For example, the Company worked directly with local representatives in Tempe, Arizona to update the local zoning code that regulates licensed medical marijuana facilities. The successfully adoption of these code amendments directly impact the continued development of any licensed medical marijuana facilities that operate within municipal limits.
 
In the event a property is not currently zoned or does not currently allow permitted use as a regulated cannabis or marijuana facility, we may work with local authorities to seek changes to existing zoning or permitted use. Our efforts may not be successful. For example, our property located in Gilbert, Arizona has not been successfully zoned and permitted for a prospective licensed medical marijuana dispensary nor has it been leased to a medical marijuana operator. We plan to lease this property to a non-cannabis tenant in the interim.
 
The Company has established a network of experts in the fields of real estate, design, construction, operations, and management in order to provide tenants and clients with comprehensive solutions to best meet their needs. We require our prospective tenants and clients to go through extensive due diligence in order to meet the Company’s standards as sophisticated and experienced operators. 
 
Our vision is to be recognized for creating the standard in property development for emerging industries, while increasing community prosperity and shareholder value. We believe that a focus on real estate and the development of properties will bring value to the local communities in which we operate and to local stakeholders. While we intend to expand into a variety of emerging industries, our current focus is on developing projects within the licensed medical marijuana industry.
 
We are the sole member of nine limited liability companies: Zoned Advisory Services, LLC (“Zoned Advisory Services”), Zoned Arizona Properties, LLC (“Zoned Arizona”), Gilbert Property Management LLC (“Gilbert Management”), Green Valley Group LLC (“Green Valley Group”), Kingman Property Group LLC (“Kingman Property”), Chino Valley Properties LLC (“Chino Valley Properties”), Zoned Colorado Properties LLC (“Zoned Colorado”), Zoned Illinois Properties LLC (“Zoned Illinois”), and Zoned Oregon Properties LLC (“Zoned Oregon”). Five of these entities own our properties: Zoned Arizona, Gilbert Management, Green Valley Group, Kingman Property, and Chino Valley Properties have all acquired land and real property.
 
On May 1, 2018, Zoned Arizona, Green Valley Group, Kingman Property, and Chino Valley Properties executed related party lease agreements at the properties within their respective regions and generate rental revenue. The lease agreements have a 22-year term, expiring on April 30, 2040. On March 15, 2017, we sold one of our buildings in Tempe, Arizona that was leased to a third party. Additionally, we own land located in Gilbert, Arizona that is leased to a third party.
The leases dated May 1, 2018, with Zoned Arizona, Green Valley Group, Kingman Property, and Chino Valley Properties each include a Guarantee of Payment and Performance by Messrs. Abrams and Carra.

Also on May 1, 2018, the Company entered into that certain Confidential Advisory Services Agreement by and between the Company and Broken Arrow (the “Broken Arrow CASA”), with a term expiring on April 30, 2040, unless earlier terminated as provided in the Broken Arrow CASA. Additionally, on May 1, 2018, the Company entered into that certain Confidential Advisory Services Agreement by and between the Company and Hana Meds (the “Hana Meds CASA”), with a term expiring on April 30, 2040, unless earlier terminated as provided in the Hana Meds CASA. Each of the Broken Arrow CASA and the Hana Meds CASA may be terminated prior to the expiration of the respective term upon the occurrence of any of the following: (a) by the Company for any reason at any time upon 30 calendar days’ written notice to the other party; (b) by either party immediately upon the mutual agreement of the parties, evidenced by a writing signed by the parties; or (c) immediately by either party in the event of an actual finding, by a court of competent jurisdiction, of fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the other party in connection with these agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the Broken Arrow CASA and Hana Meds CASA, Broken Arrow and Hana Meds engaged the Company to perform certain advisory services in exchange for a fee equal to 10% of Broken Arrow’s and Han Meds’ gross revenues (the “Revenue Fee”), commencing January 2019. The Revenue Fee was to be paid on a monthly basis, no later than 30 calendar days following the end of the immediately preceding calendar month, and the amount of such monthly payment of the Revenue Fee is equal to the product of (a) 10%, multiplied by (b) the gross revenues of Broken Arrow or Hana Meds, as the case may be, for such immediately preceding calendar month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the filing of the federal or state tax returns of Broken Arrow or Hana Meds, as the case may be, (i) the advisory client shall calculate the Revenue Fee based on the amount of the advisory client’s gross revenue reported on such federal or state tax returns, and (ii), if the amount of such calculation is greater than the sum of all monthly Revenue Fees payable to the Company under the Broken Arrow CASA or the Hana Meds CASA, as the case may be, the applicable advisory client is required to pay to the Company the amount of such difference, which amount is in addition to all monthly Revenue Fees due to the Company under the Broken Arrow CASA or the Hana Meds CASA.
 
Through December 31, 2018, each of Messrs. Abrams and Carra was a significant stockholder of the Company.
 
Effective January 1, 2019, the Company, Christopher Carra, Alan Abrams, Clayton Abrams Revocable Trust (the “Clayton Abrams Trust”), and Kyle Abrams Revocable Trust (the “Kyle Abrams Trust” and together with the Clayton Abrams Trust, the “Trusts”) entered into a Stock Redemption Agreement (the “Stock Redemption Agreement”). Prior to entry into the Stock Redemption Agreement, (i) Mr. Carra was the owner 2,028,335 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing approximately 11.6% of the Company’s outstanding shares as of January 1, 2019, and (ii) Mr. Abrams, together with the Trusts (collectively, the “Abrams Affiliates”), owned 3,611,669 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing approximately 20.7% of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of January 1, 2019. Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) rules, each of Messrs. Carra and Abrams was deemed to be a “related person” due solely to their status as significant stockholders of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Redemption Agreement, the parties agreed that the Company would redeem an aggregate of 5,640,004 owned by Mr. Carra and the Abrams Affiliates (the “Stock Redemption”) such that Messrs. Carra and Abrams would no longer be significant and stockholders of the Company and would no longer be deemed to be “related persons” under SEC rules. In exchange for the Stock Redemption, the parties agreed that:

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Following effectiveness of the Stock Redemption and the transactions set forth above:
 

● | Messrs. Carra and Abrams will no longer beneficially own any shares of the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, they will no longer be significant stockholders of the Company or “related persons” under the SEC rules. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broken Arrow will continue to be owned, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by Messrs. Abrams and Carra, and Broken Arrow will continue to be a tenant of the Company.

Multiple state-licensed operators from across the United States have approached Zoned Properties for strategic partnership and/or advisory services for development and prospective sale-lease back arrangements. We are continuously evaluating these projects as we seek development partnerships, prospective sale-lease back arrangements, and explore financing terms with capital funding sources.
 
We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from ancillary development opportunities that the regulated cannabis and marijuana industry presents without having to deal with the risk of directly cultivating, distributing, or dispensing the product, which is still illegal under federal law.
 
Our initial holdings and acquisition targets have been in the State of Arizona. Unlike many other states that have legalized and regulated cannabis and marijuana, Arizona’s program has some of the strictest regulations in the country and limits the number of dispensaries that will be allowed to be open and operate within the state. While there are hundreds of marijuana dispensaries in Denver, Colorado, the entire state of Arizona can have a maximum of 130 operating dispensaries under current legislation. Two of our properties in Arizona (Kingman and Green Valley) are leased to licensed operators that have been awarded dispensary licenses. This limitation on the number of dispensaries permitted to operate in Arizona under current legislation will limit our ability to purchase additional property in Arizona for lease to dispensary operators. 
 
Recent Corporate History and Transactions
 
On April 22, 2016, Zoned Colorado Properties, LLC (“Zoned Colorado”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Contract to Buy and Sell Real Estate (the “Parachute Agreement”) with Parachute Development Corporation (“Seller”) pursuant to which Zoned Colorado agreed to purchase, and Seller agreed to sell, property in Parachute, Colorado (the “Property”) for a purchase price of $499,857. Of the total purchase price, $274,857, or 55%, will be paid in cash at closing and $225,000, or 45%, will be financed by Seller at an interest rate of 6.5%, amortized over a five-year period, with a balloon payment at the end of the fifth year. Payments will be made monthly and there will be no pre-payment penalty. Pursuant to the terms of the Parachute Agreement, the parties will cooperate in good faith to complete due diligence during a period of 45 days following execution of the Parachute Agreement. The closing is subject to certain contingencies, including that Zoned Colorado must obtain acceptable financing for the purchase and development of the Property, the grant of a special use permit by the Town of Parachute, approval of a protected development deal or equivalent agreement by the Town of Parachute, execution of a lease agreement by a prospective tenant and the prospective tenant’s obtaining a license to cultivate on the Property. Pursuant to the terms of the Parachute Agreement, Zoned Colorado will have a right of first refusal on eleven additional lots owned by Seller in Parachute, Colorado. In April 2016, the Company paid a refundable deposit of $45,000 into escrow in connection with the Parachute Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the Company and Seller have yet to complete the purchase.
 
On December 22, 2016, we entered into a Commercial Real Estate Purchase Contract (the “Purchase Contract”) with a third party (the “Purchaser”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, and the Purchaser agreed to purchase, the property located at 422 S. Madison Drive in Tempe, Arizona, for an aggregate purchase price of $2.125 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract, the Purchaser paid a deposit of $20,000 within three days of entry into the Agreement, which amount will be held in escrow. In addition, in 2017, the Purchaser deposited an additional deposit of $20,000. The remainder of the purchase price ($2.085 million) was due at closing. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract, the purchase closed on March 15, 2017. In connection with the sale of this building on March 15, 2017, we repaid the outstanding principal of $2,200,000 and interest due on this mortgage.
 
As discussed above, effective January 1, 2019, the Company, Christopher Carra, Alan Abrams, Clayton Abrams Trust, and Kyle Abrams Trust and together with the Clayton Abrams Trust, the “Trusts”) entered into a Stock Redemption Agreement. Prior to entry into the Stock Redemption Agreement, (i) Mr. Carra was the owner 2,028,335 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing approximately 11.6% of the Company’s outstanding shares as of January 1, 2019, and (ii) Mr. Abrams, together with the Trusts (collectively, the “Abrams Affiliates”), owned 3,611,669 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing approximately 20.7% of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of January 1, 2019. Pursuant to SEC rules, each of Messrs. Carra and Abrams was deemed to be a “related person” due solely to their status as significant stockholders of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Redemption Agreement, the parties agreed that the Company would redeem an aggregate of 5,640,004 owned by Mr. Carra and the Abrams Affiliates such that Messrs. Carra and Abrams would no longer be significant and stockholders of the Company and would no longer be deemed to be “related persons” under SEC rules.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, rental income associated with all related party leases amounted to $1,186,775 and $2,033,684, respectively.
 
Clients
 
We target clients who require assistance with the identification and development of regulated cannabis and marijuana projects. Our ideal prospective clients will have a commitment to sophisticated, safe, and sustainable project development. The most significant barrier to success for many industry operators and prospective clients includes distractions from primary business operations. These distractions often include services related to the identification, zoning, permitting, and development of real estate.
 
We complete significant due diligence on prospective tenants and prospective clients regardless of industry focus. Credit-worthiness, character, and cash flows are all important traits that contribute to a sophisticated client for the Company.

Marketing
 
Currently, the Company does not actively market its services using any direct marketing campaigns. Industry reputation, word-of-mouth, and networking are the primary tools used to complete the marketing of our services. We maintain an updated website, shareholder presentation, and profile outlining the Company’s services. These tools are created for transparency of operations and activities. Our executive management believes the reputation of having integrity is an essential tool for marketing and business development.
Competition
 
The commercial real estate market is highly competitive. We believe finding properties that are zoned for the specific use of allowing regulated cannabis and marijuana operations may be limited as more competitors enter the market. Several competitors have recently entered the marketplace. We face significant competition from a diverse mix of market participants, including but not limited to, other public companies with similar business models, independent investors, hedge funds and other real estate investors, hard money lenders, as well as would be clients, marijuana operators themselves, all of whom, who may compete against us in our efforts to acquire real estate zoned for marijuana grow and retail operations. In some instances, we will be competing to acquire real estate with persons who have no interest in the regulated cannabis and marijuana business, but have identified value in a piece of real estate that we may be interested in acquiring.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to applicable provisions of federal and state securities laws and to regulations specifically governing the real estate industry, including those governing fair housing and federally backed mortgage programs. Our operations will also be subject to regulations normally incident to business operations, such as occupational safety and health acts, workmen’s compensation statutes, unemployment insurance legislation and income tax and social security related regulations. Although we will use our best efforts to comply with applicable regulations, we can provide no assurance of our ability to do so, nor can we fully predict the effect of these regulations on our proposed activities.
 
In addition, zoning commercial properties for specific purposes, such as medical marijuana dispensaries or cultivation facilities, is subject to specific regulations to the zoning requirements for the city, county and state related to any medical marijuana facility. We expect regulations to get tighter as time goes on.
 
In November 2010, Arizona voters passed the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (“AMMA”). The AMMA designates the Arizona Department of Health Services (“ADHS”) as the licensing authority for the program. ADHS is tasked with issuing Registry Identification Cards (“RIC”) to qualifying patients, designated caregivers, and dispensary agents, as well as selecting, registering, and providing oversight for nonprofit medical marijuana dispensaries. With permission from ADHS, qualifying patients or their caregivers may cultivate marijuana if the patient lives more than 25 miles from a dispensary.
 
Qualifying patients can legally possess and purchase medical marijuana under Arizona law as long as they hold a RIC. They acquire their medicine from non-profit medical marijuana dispensaries. These dispensaries acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply, sell, and dispense medical marijuana. Arizona is divided into 126 Community Health Assessment Areas (each, a “CHAA”) and each CHAA may only have one dispensary located within it. Dispensaries are the only place patients are legally allowed to purchase medical marijuana in Arizona. Arizona law permits the number of CHAAs to change based on the number of registered pharmacies in Arizona. In order to operate, a dispensary must have a Dispensary Registration Certificate and Approval to Operate Certificate from ADHS. The first dispensaries began operation in 2012, and it is anticipated that at maturity, there will be about 112 dispensaries statewide - one in each CHAA not part of one of Arizona’s Native American Indian Reservations.
 
The U.S. Government classifies marijuana as a schedule-I controlled substance under the CSA. The CSA makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana. The Company maintains its operations so as to remain in compliance with the CSA. Even in those jurisdictions in which the manufacture and use of medical marijuana has been legalized at the state level, the possession, use and cultivation all remain violations of federal law that are punishable by imprisonment and substantial fines, and the prescription of marijuana is a violation of federal law. Moreover, individuals and entities may violate federal law if they intentionally aid and abet another in violating these federal controlled substance laws, or conspire with another to violate them. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop. and Gonzales v. Raich that it is the federal government that has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes. Therefore, federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana pre-empts state laws that legalize its use for medicinal purposes.

On January 4, 2018, then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the Sessions Memo, rescinding the Cole Memo and related internal guidance issued by the DOJ regarding federal law enforcement priorities involving marijuana. The Sessions Memo instructs federal prosecutors that when determining which marijuana-related activities to prosecute under federal law with the DOJ’s finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles set forth in the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual governing all federal prosecutions. The Sessions Memo states that “these principles require federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” The Sessions Memo went on to state that given the DOJ’s well-established general principles, “previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.”
 
It is unclear at this time what impact the Sessions Memo will have on the medical-use marijuana industry. In addition, pursuant to the current omnibus spending bill previously approved by Congress, the DOJ was prohibited from using funds appropriated by Congress to prevent states from implementing their medical-use cannabis laws. This provision, however, will expire on September 30, 2019. There is no assurance that Congress will approve inclusion of a similar prohibition on DOJ spending in the appropriations bill for 2019. Although we are not engaged in the purchase, sale, growth, cultivation, harvesting, or processing of medical-use marijuana products, we lease our properties to tenants who engage in such activities, and therefore strict enforcement of federal prohibitions regarding marijuana could irreparably harm our business, subject us to criminal prosecution and/or adversely affect the trading price of our securities.
 
Additionally, financial transactions involving proceeds generated by marijuana-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statutes and the Bank Secrecy Act. Prior to the DOJ's rescission of the “Cole Memo”, supplemental guidance from the DOJ issued under the Obama Administration directed federal prosecutors to consider the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the “Cole Memo” when determining whether to charge institutions or individuals with any of the financial crimes described above based upon marijuana-related activity. It is unclear what impact the recent rescission of the “Cole Memo” will have, but federal prosecutors may increase enforcement activities against institutions or individuals that are conducting financial transactions related to marijuana activities.
 
Federal prosecutors have significant discretion and no assurance can be given that the federal prosecutor in each judicial district where we own a property will not choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing marijuana production or distribution. Any change in the federal government's enforcement posture with respect to state-licensed cultivation of medical-use cannabis, including the enforcement postures of individual federal prosecutors in judicial districts where we own or may purchase properties, would result in our inability to execute our business plan, and we would likely suffer significant losses with respect to our investment in marijuana facilities in the United States, which would adversely affect the trading price of our securities. Furthermore, following any such change in the federal government's enforcement position, we could be subject to criminal prosecution, which could lead to imprisonment and/or the imposition of penalties, fines, or forfeiture.

Financial transactions involving proceeds generated by marijuana-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statute and the Bank Secrecy Act. Previous guidance issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a division of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“FinCEN”), clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Prior to the DOJ’s announcement in January 2018 of the rescission of the “Cole Memo” and related memoranda, supplemental guidance from the DOJ directed federal prosecutors to consider the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the “Cole Memo” when determining whether to charge institutions or individuals with any of the financial crimes described above based upon marijuana-related activity.
 
Consequently, those businesses involved in the marijuana industry continue to encounter difficulty establishing banking relationships, which may increase over time. Our inability to maintain our current bank accounts would make it difficult for us to operate our business, increase our operating costs, and pose additional operational, logistical and security challenges and could result in our inability to implement our business plan.
 
The inability of our current and potential tenants to open accounts and continue using the services of banks will limit their ability to enter into triple-net lease arrangements with us or may result in their default under our lease agreements, either of which could materially harm our business and the trading price of our securities.
 
Local, state and federal marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our proposed business. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had two full-time employees, our chief executive officer and a division manager. We have established an extensive network of external partners, contractors, and consultants to outsource to in an effort to minimize administrative overhead and maximize efficiency.
