Item 1. | Business
---------+---------

 Sprouts Farmers Market operates as a healthy grocery store that specializes in fresh, natural and organic products at prices that appeal to everyday grocery shoppers. Based on the belief that healthy food should be affordable, Sprouts’ welcoming environment and knowledgeable team members continue to drive its growth. Sprouts offers a complete grocery shopping experience that includes an array of fresh produce in the heart of the store, a deli with prepared entrees and side dishes, The Butcher Shop, The Fish Market, an expansive vitamins and supplements department and more. Since our founding in 2002, we have grown rapidly, significantly increasing our sales, store count and profitability. With 313 stores in 19 states as of December 30, 2018, we are one of the largest specialty retailers of fresh, natural and organic food in the United States. As of February 18, 2019, we have grown to 318 stores in 19 states.
 At Sprouts, we believe healthy living is a journey and every meal is a choice. The cornerstones of our business are fresh, natural and organic products at compelling prices (which we refer to as “Healthy Living for Less”), an attractive and differentiated shopping experience featuring a broad selection of innovative healthy products, and knowledgeable team members who we believe provide best-in-class customer engagement and product education. 
 Our Heritage 
 In 2002, we opened the first Sprouts Farmers Market store in Chandler, Arizona. From our founding in 2002 through December 30, 2018, we have continued to open new stores while successfully rebranding to the Sprouts banner 43 Henry’s Farmers Market and 39 Sunflower Farmers Market stores added in 2011 and 2012, respectively, through acquisitions. These three businesses all trace their lineage back to Henry’s Farmers Market and were built with similar store formats and operations including a strong emphasis on value, produce and service in smaller, convenient locations. The consistency of these formats and operations was an important factor that allowed us to rapidly and successfully rebrand and integrate each of these businesses under the Sprouts banner and on a common platform.

Our Stores and Operations 
 We believe our stores represent a blend of conventional supermarkets, farmers markets, natural foods stores, and smaller specialty markets, differentiating us from other food retailers, while also providing a complete offering for our customers. 

• | Store Design. Our stores are organized in a “flipped” conventional food retail store model, positioning our produce at the center of the store surrounded by a complete grocery offering. We typically dedicate approximately 15% of a store’s selling square footage to produce, which we believe is significantly higher than many of our peers. The stores are designed with open floor plans and low displays, intended to provide an easy-to-shop environment that allows our customers to view the entire store, and our small box format allows for quick in-and-out service. The below diagram shows a sample layout of our stores:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer Engagement. We are committed to providing, and believe we have, best-in-class customer engagement, which builds trust with our customers and differentiates the Sprouts shopping experience from that of many of our competitors. We design our stores to maximize customers’ interactions with our team members, as we believe this interaction provides an opportunity to educate customers and provides a valued, differentiated customer service model, which enhances customer loyalty and increases visits and purchases over time. In addition, we continue to explore mobile and digital opportunities to further engage with our customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Store Size. Our stores are generally between 28,000 and 30,000 square feet, which we believe is smaller than many of our peers’ average stores. Our stores are located in a variety of mid-sized and larger shopping centers, lifestyle centers and in certain cases, independent single-unit, stand-alone developments. The size of our stores and our real estate strategy provide us flexibility in site selection, including entering into new developments or existing sites formerly operated by other retailers, including other grocery banners, office supply stores, electronics retailers and other second generation space. Further, we believe our value positioning allows us to serve a diverse customer base and provides us significant flexibility to enter new markets across a variety of socio-economic areas, including markets with varying levels of fresh, natural and organic grocer penetration.

• | Team Members. Our stores are typically staffed with 80 to 100 full and part-time team members including a store manager, two assistant store managers, eight department managers, eight to ten assistant department managers, store office staff and other team members. We strive to create a strong and unified company culture and develop team members throughout the entire organization, and we assist our store teams with our store support office and regional teams. We have prioritized making investments in training that we believe enhances our team members’ knowledge, particularly with respect to our expanded and evolving product offerings, so our team members can continue to engage and assist our customers. We believe our team members contribute to our consistently high service standards and that this helps us successfully open and operate our stores.

Our Product Offering 
 We are a complete food retailer that offers a full shopping experience for our customers. We focus and tailor our assortment to fresh, natural and organic foods and healthier options throughout all of our departments. 
Fresh, Natural and Organic Foods 
 We focus our product offerings on fresh, natural and organic foods. Foods are generally considered “fresh” if they are minimally processed or in their raw state not subject to any type of preservation or freezing. Natural foods can be broadly defined as foods that are minimally processed and are free of synthetic preservatives, artificial sweeteners, colors, flavors and other additives, growth hormones, antibiotics, hydrogenated oils, stabilizers and emulsifiers. Essentially, natural foods are largely or completely free of non-naturally occurring chemicals and are as near to their whole, natural state as possible. 
 Organic foods refer to the food itself as well as the method by which it is produced. In general, organic operations must demonstrate that they are protecting natural resources, conserving biodiversity, and using only approved substances and must be certified by a USDA-accredited certifying agency. Further, retailers that handle, store or sell organic products must implement measures to protect their organic character. 
 Products 
 We categorize the varieties of products we sell as perishable and non-perishable. Perishable product categories include produce, meat, seafood, deli, bakery, floral and dairy and dairy alternatives. Non-perishable product categories include grocery, vitamins and supplements, bulk items, frozen foods, beer and wine, and natural health and body care. The following is a breakdown of our perishable and non-perishable sales mix: 

 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
----------------+------+------+---+------+------+-----
Perishables | | 57.5 | % | | 58.0 | % | 58.1 | %
Non-Perishables | | 42.5 | % | | 42.0 | % | 41.9 | %

Departments 
 While we focus on providing an abundant and affordable offering of natural and organic produce, our stores also include the following departments that enable customers to have a full grocery shopping experience: packaged groceries, meat and seafood, deli, vitamins and supplements, dairy and dairy alternatives, bulk items, baked goods, frozen foods, natural health and body care, and beer and wine. We believe each of our departments provides high-quality, value-oriented offerings for our customers which we continuously refine with our customer preferences in mind, including our ongoing fresh food and deli expansion initiatives in select stores, comprised of freshly prepared proteins and sides, full service deli case, salad bar, fresh juices and soup station to provide more convenient prepared food options for our customers.

Private Label 
 We have been expanding the breadth of our Sprouts branded products over the last several years and have a dedicated product development team focused on continuing this growth. These products feature competitively priced specialty and innovative products, with great taste profiles and quality and strict ingredient standards that we believe equal or exceed n
ational brands. Our private label program accounted for approximately 13% of our revenue in 2018 and features approximately 2,400 products. Our private label brands drive value by offering our customers lower prices while still delivering generally higher margin as compared to branded products. We believe our private label products build and enhance the Sprouts brand and allow us to distinguish ourselves from our competitors, promoting customer loyalty and creating a destination shopping experience. 
Sourcing and Distribution 
 We manage the buying of, and set the standards for, the products we sell, and we source our products from over 780 vendors and suppliers, both domestically and internationally. We work closely with our supply chain partners to improve animal welfare standards, sustainable seafood sourcing, support for organic agriculture and the ethical treatment of people.
 We believe, based on our industry experience, that our strong relationships in the produce business provide us a competitive advantage and enable us to offer high-quality produce at prices we believe are significantly below those of conventional food retailers and even further below high-end natural and organic food retailers. Given the importance of produce to our stores, we source, warehouse and self-distribute nearly all produce. This ensures our produce meets our high quality standards. We are supported by dedicated regional procurement teams that provide us flexibility to procure produce on local, regional and national levels. 
 We have department and product specifications that ensure a consistently high level of quality across product ingredients, production standards and other key measures of freshness, natural and organic standards. These specifications are measured at both entry and exit points to our facilities. We distribute all produce to our stores from two leased distribution centers and three third-party operated distribution centers, and we manage every aspect of quality control in this department. We believe we currently have sufficient capacity at these facilities to support our near-term growth plans in our current markets, but we continue to explore expansion opportunities as our needs evolve. 
 We believe our scale, together with this decentralized purchasing structure and flexibility generates cost savings, which we then pass on to our customers. Distributors and farmers recognize the volume of goods we sell through our stores and our flexible purchasing and supply chain model allows us to opportunistically acquire produce at great value which we will also pass along to our customers. 
 For all non-produce products, we use third-party distributors and vendors to distribute products directly to our stores following specifications and quality control standards that are set by us. 
 KeHE Distributors, LLC (“KeHE”), is our primary supplier of dry grocery and frozen food products, accounting for approximately 34%, 34% and 33% of our total purchases in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Another 4% of our total purchases in each of fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were made through our secondary supplier, United Natural Foods, Inc. (“UNFI”). See “Risk Factors—Disruption of significant supplier relationships could negatively affect our business.”

Our Pricing, Marketing and Advertising 
 Pricing
 We are committed to a pricing strategy consistent with our motto of “Healthy Living for Less.” As a farmers market style store, we emphasize low prices throughout the entire store, as we are able to pass along the benefits of our scale and purchasing power to our customers. We position our prices with everyday value for our customers with regular promoti
ons on selected products that drive traffic and trial. We typically have about 31% of our approximately 20,100 products on sale at any given time. 
 Marketing and Advertising
 We supplement and support our everyday competitive pricing strategy through weekly advertised specials, a weekly e-circular, online coupons and special promotions. We send over 19 million weekly advertisement circulars to encourage customers to shop at our stores. These circulars focus on product education and offerings and aim to engage the customer. We use sales flyers distributed through direct delivery or inserted into local newspapers as our primary medium for advertising. These sales flyers include representative products from our key departments. In addition, we have a customer database of over two million customers as of December 30, 2018, many of whom receive electronic versions of our weekly circulars or monthly newsletters. 
 We tailor our advertisements to specific markets, which provides us with greater flexibility to offer different promotions and respond to local competitive activity. In addition, we advertise our sales promotions and support our brand image through the use of local radio, television and billboards, as well as targeted direct mail in specific markets. 
 We also continue to promote and enhance our digital presence.  We developed and maintain a smartphone app on which we include mobile coupons, customized offers based on the user’s preferences and in-store scan features, and our website, www.sprouts.com, on which we display our weekly sales flyers, highlight our product offerings and offer special deals. Our website and smartphone app also feature on-line ordering for delivery. The inclusion of our website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include or incorporate by reference the information on or accessible through our website herein. We continue to expand our social media platform. As of December 30, 2018, we had approximately 1.6 million social media followers, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. In addition, we offer home deliveries from our stores through partner services in many of our markets, and we intend to expand our home delivery to our major markets nationwide. We will continue to explore mobile and digital opportunities to further connect with our customers.    
 In addition to the weekly circulars, we offer numerous other saving opportunities for our customers, all of which are meant to reinforce our value offering and are designed to appeal to specific target customers. In 2018, we had more than 30 major promotional events throughout the year, which included our Vitamin Extravaganza, Frozen Frenzy, Gluten-Free Favorites, and Incredible Bulk Sales, in addition to our 72-Hour Sales. 
 Our Customers 
 Our target customer seeks a wide assortment of high-quality fresh and nutritious food as well as vitamins and supplements at competitive prices. We believe our value proposition and complete grocery offering engages both conventional and health-focused shoppers.

We have a broad range of customers from those looking for value, to customers seeking specific attribute products, to those seeking to eat healthier. We believe the majority of our customers are initially attracted to our stores by our fresh produce, which we offer at prices we believe are significantly below those of conventional food retailers and even further below high-end natural and organic food retailers. We drive customer traffic by aggressively promoting produce and other items through weekly advertisements designed primarily to reach the everyday supermarket shopper. Through department-specific promotions, in-store signage, digital engagement and customer education, many customers begin to shop new departments and try new products. Over time, through customer service and engagement, targeted marketing, and increased knowledge of our product offering, we believe that customers will shop with greater frequency throughout the entire store.
 Sustainability and Social Responsibility
 Central to our identity is a genuine commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. We care deeply about the health and well-being of our customers, team members, communities and our world.  We are committed to operating our business in a way that respects social and environmental welfare. 
Hunger Relief and Waste Management
 In the United States, approximately 40% of all food grown goes uneaten and ends up in landfills, while one in seven Americans is food insecure at some point throughout a given year.  We are committed to eliminating food waste and fighting hunger in the communities we serve.  We have taken great strides to ensure that each of our stores and distribution centers has a food recovery program in place.  In 2018, Sprouts rescued and repurposed nearly 64 million pounds of food.  
 Every day, Sprouts team members gather product that may no longer be in retail condition, but remains wholesome to consume, through our Food Rescue Program.  In 2018, Sprouts stores and distribution centers donated over 27 million pounds of food, the equivalent of 23 million meals to hunger relief agencies.  Our annual Grab’N’Give campaign funded by contributions from our customers generated over 487,000 personal care and emergency food bags for those in need. Sprouts was proud to once again be named a Leadership Partner by Feeding America in 2018 for our commitment to help those facing hunger in our communities.
 Food that did not meet our Food Rescue Program donation guidelines was sent to local farms through our Food Waste to Farms Program.  In 2018, our stores diverted more than 37 million pounds of food waste to these farms to provide a low-cost feed source for local farmers. As part of our further effort to combat waste, during 2018 we recycled more than 91 million pounds of cardboard. These waste reduction initiatives reduce our environmental footprint and waste management expenditures and take Sprouts closer to our commitment to “zero waste.”   
 Refrigeration and Energy Management
 Sprouts has a robust refrigeration and energy management plan in place to reduce fugitive refrigeration emissions and reduce energy consumption in our stores. In 2017, we conducted our first annual greenhouse gas emissions inventory and identified areas of opportunity within our operations and supply chain, and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) recognized 76 Sprouts stores with “GreenChill” certifications; the GreenChill program is a partnership between the EPA and food retailers to reduce refrigerant emissions and decrease their impact on the ozone layer and climate change.

To further reduce energy consumption in our stores, Sprouts implemented a program engaging our approximately 30,000 team members to “Save Green”.  The Save Green program is a team member engagement tool aimed at reducing energy consumption and costs through best practices.  Sprouts also embeds green building practices into our new stores and remodels that lead to long-term reduced energy consumption and cost.  Some examples include daylight harvesting, LED lighting and energy management systems to control refrigeration and HVAC.  
 The Sprouts Healthy Communities Foundation
 In 2015, we formed the Sprouts Healthy Communities Foundation (referred to as our “Foundation”), a registered 501(c)(3) organization focused on promoting nutrition education and fresh food access in local communities where Sprouts operates. Our Foundation relies on donations from Sprouts, as well as our vendors and customers, to support non-profit organizations that fulfill its mission. Sprouts covers 100% of the Foundation’s operational expenses ensuring that every dollar raised benefits the Foundation’s programs. Since the Foundation’s inception, it has provided over $7 million in donations to more than 250 non-profit organizations.
 
Our Foundation has multi-year partnerships with seven organizations that are committed to making a meaningful difference in the lives of children, individuals and families.

 The Foundation began the Neighborhood Grants program in 2017 to distribute donations received from Sprouts and our customers entirely in the communities in which the donations were collected. In 2018, with Neighborhood Grants ranging from $2,500 to $10,000, our Foundation contributed $550,000 to 85 local non-profit organizations aligned with its goal to create stronger and healthier communities. Our Foundation and stores also contributed financial and in-kind donations to those impacted by natural disasters during 2018 in North Carolina and California. On November 3, 2018 we hosted our first company-wide Day of Service, uniting 500 team members for 28 community service projects across the country.

Growing Our Business
 We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on two powerful, long-term consumer trends—a growing interest in health and wellness and a focus on value and are pursuing a number of strategies designed to continue our growth and strong financial performance, including: 
 Expand our store base. We intend to continue expanding our store base by pursuing new store openings in existing markets, expanding into adjacent markets and penetrating new markets. We have opened 30, 32 and 36 new stores in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  We expect to continue to expand our store base with approximately 28 store openings and one relocation planned for fiscal 2019, of which five new stores have opened as of February 18, 2019. In the near term we expect to open approximately 30 new stores annually, with approximately 50% in existing markets. 
 The below diagram shows our store footprint, by state, as of December 30, 2018.

Continue positive comparable store sales. For 47 consecutive quarters, including throughout the economic downturn from 2008 to 2010, stores under our management have achieved positive comparable store sales growth. We believe the consistency of our performance over time and across geographies and vintages is the result of a number of factors, including our distinctive value positioning and merchandising strategies, product innovation and a well-trained staff focused on customer education and engagement. We believe we can continue to grow the number and size of customer transactions by enhancing our core value proposition and distinctive customer-oriented shopping experience. We aim to grow our average ticket by continuing to expand and refine our fresh, natural and organic product offering, our private label program, our targeted and personalized marketing efforts and our in-store and digital education. We believe these factors, combined with the continued strong growth in fresh, natural and organic food consumption, will allow Sprouts to gain new customers, increase customer loyalty and, over time, convert single-department customers into core customers who shop Sprouts with greater frequency and across an increasing number of departments. 
 Grow the Sprouts Farmers Market brand. We are committed to supporting our stores, product offerings and brand through a variety of marketing programs, expanded private label offerings and corporate partnerships. In addition, we will continue our community outreach and charity programs to more broadly connect with our local communities with the aim of promoting our brand and educating consumers on healthy choices. We will also continue to expand our innovative marketing and promotional strategy through print, digital and social media platforms. 
 Train Future Leaders. We believe Sprouts is an attractive place to work with significant growth opportunities for our approximately 30,000 team members. In 2018, we promoted more than 6,000 team members. We regularly assess prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate and offer competitive wages and benefits as we believe active, educated and passionate team members contribute to consumer satisfaction. Customer engagement is critical to our culture and growth plans, and we place great importance on recruiting candidates that share our passion for Healthy Living for Less and training our team members on customer engagement and product knowledge to ensure there is friendly, knowledgeable staff in every department in every store. Our team members are trained and empowered to proactively engage with customers throughout the entire store. This includes investing time to educate them on the benefits of different vitamins, sharing ways to prepare a meal or cutting a piece of produce or opening a package to offer customers product tastings throughout the store. We consider customer education and engagement to be particularly important as many conventional supermarket customers that have not shopped our stores believe that eating healthy is expensive and difficult. 
New Store Development 
 We have an extensive and selective process for new store site selection, which includes in-depth analysis of area demographics, competition, growth potential, traffic patterns, grocery spend and other key criteria. We have a dedicated real estate team as well as a real estate committee that includes certain of our executive officers. Multiple members of this committee will conduct an on-site inspection prior to approving any new location. 
 We believe that our store model, combined with our rigorous store selection process and a growing interest in health and wellness, contribute to our attractive new store returns on investment and strong cash flows. We have been successful across varying geographies which we believe supports the portability of the Sprouts brand and store model into a wide range of markets. Based on our experience, we believe that our broad product offering and value proposition appeals to a wider demographic than other leading competitors, including higher-priced health food and gourmet food retailers. Sprouts has been successful across a variety of urban, suburban and rural locations in diverse geographies, from coast to coast, underscoring the heightened interest in eating healthy across markets. 
 
9


We currently expect to open approximately 30 new Sprouts Farmers Market stores per year over the near term based on our new store site selection analysis. We expect to open approximately 50% of our new stores in existing markets and approximately 50% in new markets, as we believe this provides for a good balance, given that our new stores in existing markets mature more quickly than those in new markets.  This mix allows us to focus our resources on developing our new markets, so they begin with a solid foundation.
 See “Properties” for additional information with respect to our store locations. 
 Our Competition and Industry
 We operate within the intensely competitive and highly fragmented grocery store industry which encompasses a wide array of food retailers, including large conventional independent and chain supermarkets, warehouse clubs, small grocery and convenience stores, and natural and organic, specialty, mass, discount and other food retail and online formats. According to the Progressive Grocer, U.S. supermarket sales totaled $683 billion in 2017. Based on our industry experience, we believe we are capturing significant market share from conventional supermarkets and specialty concepts in this supermarket segment. 
 While the natural and organic food segment is one of the fastest growing segments in the industry, conventional supermarkets have experienced overall share decline from approximately 73% in 2005 to approximately 63% in 2017, according to the Progressive Grocer, as customers have migrated to other grocery retail formats. Conventional supermarket customers are attracted to unique product offerings, formats and differentiated shopping experiences. Based on our industry experience, we also believe consumers are increasingly focused on health and wellness and are actively seeking healthy foods in order to improve eating habits. This overall demand for healthy products is driven by many factors, including increased awareness about the benefits of eating healthy, a greater focus on preventative health measures, and the rising costs of health care. We believe customers are attracted to retailers with comprehensive health and wellness product offerings. As a result, food retailers are offering an increased assortment of fresh, natural and organic foods as well as vitamins and supplements to meet this demand.
 Our competitors include conventional supermarkets such as Kroger, Albertsons and Safeway, and other food retailers such as Whole Foods, Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage and Trader Joe’s, as well as mass or discount retailers, warehouse membership clubs, online retailers such as Amazon, specialty stores, restaurants, and home delivery and meal solution companies. We believe Sprouts offers consumers a compelling value relative to our competitors and will continue to benefit from increasing consumer focus on health, wellness and value, as well as their emphasis on an enhanced shopping experience featuring a broad selection of products along with exceptional customer engagement. 
 Insurance and Risk Management 
 We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation, general liability, product liability, director and officers’ liability, team member healthcare benefits, and other casualty and property risks. Changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage. 
 
10


Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 
 We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks, including our registered SPROUTS FARMERS MARKET®, SPROUTS® and HEALTHY LIVING FOR LESS!® trademarks, are valuable assets that we believe reinforce our customers’ favorable perception of our stores. In addition to our trademarks, we believe that our trade dress, which includes the human-scale design, arrangement, color scheme and other physical characteristics of our stores and product displays, is a large part of the farmers market atmosphere we create in our stores and enables customers to distinguish our stores and products from those of our competitors. 
 From time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied to register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. Third parties have also, from time to time, opposed our trademarks and challenged our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis. The outcomes of these actions have included both negotiated out-of-court settlements as well as litigation. 
 Information Technology Systems 
 We have made significant investments in information technology infrastructure and business systems, including point-of-sale, data warehouse, labor management, purchasing, inventory control, demand forecasting, financial and reporting systems. Our recent investments have focused on solutions to enhance our operational productivity, optimize our labor, maintain our in-stock positions and forecast our customer demand, while maintaining our high quality and value proposition.  All of our stores operate under one integrated information technology platform which allows for our current and future store growth. We will continue making investments in our current information technology infrastructure and invest in systems that scale to support our growth and add efficiencies to our growing operations.  
Regulatory Compliance 
 Our stores are subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages, environmental protection, licensing for the sale of food and, in many stores, licensing for beer and wine or other alcoholic beverages. Our operations, including the manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) and the EPA. 
 Food. The FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate the safety of food and food ingredients (other than meat, poultry, catfish and certain egg products), as well as dietary supplements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Similarly, the USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service is the public health agency responsible for ensuring that the nation’s commercial supply of meat, poultry, catfish and certain egg products is safe, wholesome and correctly labeled and packaged under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act. 
 Congress amended the FDCA in 2011 through passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), which greatly expanded FDA’s regulatory obligations over all actors in the supply chain. Industry actors continue to determine the best pathways to implement FSMA’s regulatory mandates and FDA’s promulgating regulations throughout supply chains, as most requirements are now in effect. Such regulations mandate that risk-based preventive controls be observed by the majority of food producers. This authority applies to all domestic food facilities and, by way of imported food supplier verification requirements, to all foreign facilities that supply food products. 
 
11


The FDA also exercises broad jurisdiction over the labeling and promotion of food. Labeling is a broad concept that, under certain circumstances, extends even to product-related claims and representations made on a company’s website or similar printed or graphic medium. All foods, including dietary supplements, must bear labeling that provides consumers with essential information with respect to standards of identity, net quantity, nutrition facts labeling, ingredient statement, allergen disclosures. FDA also regulates the use of structure/function claims, health claims and nutrient content claims. Additional in-store labeling requirements, such as disclosure of calories and other nutrient information for frequently sold items are scheduled to go into effect in 2018. In addition, compliance dates on various nutrition initiatives that will impact many actors in our supply chain, such as in relation to partially hydrogenated oils and new nutritional labeling guidelines, are scheduled to go into effect beginning 2018 and scheduled into 2021.
USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (“AMS”) oversees compliance with the National Organic Standards Program and related labeling activity. In addition, AMS has responsibility for newly enacted requirements surrounding the disclosure of the presence of bioengineered ingredients in food, scheduled to go into effect beginning in 2020. 
 Dietary Supplements. The FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate the safety of dietary supplements, dietary ingredients, labeling and current good manufacturing practices. Congress amended the FDCA in 1994 through passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (“DSHEA”), which greatly expanded FDA’s regulatory authority over dietary supplements. Through DSHEA, dietary supplements became its own regulated commodity while also allowing structure/function claims on products. However, no statement on a dietary supplement may expressly or implicitly represent that it will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease. 
 Food and Dietary Supplement Advertising. The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of foods and dietary supplements. The FTC has the power to institute monetary sanctions and the imposition of consent decrees and penalties that can severely limit a company’s business practices. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. 
 Compliance. As is common in our industry, we rely on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. In general, we seek certifications of compliance, representations and warranties, indemnification and/or insurance from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. However, even with adequate insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in products we sell. In addition, the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or remove such products from our stores. In order to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, our suppliers and contract manufacturers have from time to time reformulated, eliminated or relabeled certain of their products and we have revised certain provisions of our sales and marketing program. 
Employees 
 As of December 30, 2018, we had approximately 30,000 team members. None of our team members are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our team members to be good, and we have never experienced a strike or significant work stoppage.
