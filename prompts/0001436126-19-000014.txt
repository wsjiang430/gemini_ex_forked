OUR SPECIALIZED SOLUTIONS
As a OneSource provider of asset protection solutions, MISTRAS combines our industry-leading services, products and technologies to provide a unique, custom-tailored solution for each customer’s individual asset protection need, ranging from routine inspections to complex, plant-wide asset integrity management.
Field Inspections
Our field inspections portfolio includes traditional and advanced Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques, along with predictive maintenance (PdM) assessments of fixed and rotating assets. We offer these solutions on an individual basis, or as parts of plant-wide inspection and testing programs.
NDT is the examination of an asset without materially impacting its integrity. The ability to inspect infrastructure assets and not interfere with their operating performance makes NDT a highly-attractive alternative to many traditional techniques, which may require shutting down an asset or entire facility. Typical issues that MISTRAS technicians inspect for include corrosion, cracking, leaking, faults and flaws in piping, storage tanks, pressure vessels and a wide range of other industrial assets.
Field inspection services lend themselves to integration with our other offerings, and as such have often served as the initial entry point to more advanced customer engagements that require additional solutions. After an initial field inspection is performed, MISTRAS is able to provide multiple supplemental solutions that further serve to solidify our relationships with our clients and drive additional revenue.
Consulting
We provide a broad range of engineering consulting services, primarily for process equipment, technologies and facilities. Our engineering consultations include plant operations and management support, turnaround/shutdown planning, profit improvement, facilities planning studies, engineering design, process safety reviews, energy optimization evaluations, benchmarking/key performance indicator (KPI) development and technical training.
Our Asset Integrity Management/Mechanical Integrity (AIMS/MI) services help improve asset reliability and regulatory compliance through a systematic, engineering-based approach to ensure the ongoing integrity and safety of equipment and industrial facilities. AIMS/MI services can include conducting an inventory of infrastructure assets; developing, implementing and training personnel in executing inspection and maintenance procedures; and managing MI programs. We help to identify 
4

gaps between existing and desired practices and establish quality assurance standards for fabrication, engineering and installation of infrastructure assets.
Maintenance
We perform maintenance and light mechanical services to prepare assets for inspection and to return them to working condition post inspection. These services include corrosion removal, mitigation and prevention; insulation installation and removal; electrical services; heat tracing, industrial cleaning; pipefitting; and welding. Our light mechanical services are often offered as complementary, value-added solutions to inspections, such as removing insulation in order to inspect piping, then re-installing insulation.
Our multi-disciplined technicians offer maintenance and light mechanical services in hard-to-access areas, in combination with rope access or diving strategies.
Mechanical services are still a small part of our business, and we carefully try to avoid providing any such services that conflict with our inspection services.
Data Management
Our world-class enterprise inspection database management software (IDMS) - Plant Condition Management Software (PCMS®) - was developed specifically for process industries and equipment, and enables the storage, organization and analysis of inspection data. 
PCMS offers wide-ranging support for mechanical integrity programs, including:

• | Comprehensive inspection tracking, scheduling and analysis


• | Corrosion analysis & trending


• | Integrated risk-based inspection (RBI) calculators


• | Safety relief valve management

PCMS compares data to prior operations, similar assets, industrial standards and specific risk conditions, such as use with highly-flammable or corrosive materials. It also develops asset integrity management plans based on RBI calculations that specify an optimal schedule for the testing, maintenance and retirement of assets.
In many instances, customers of our field inspections and consulting services also have licensed PCMS for storage and analysis of collected inspection and MI data.
We believe PCMS is one of the most widely used plant condition management software systems in North American refineries. We estimate it is currently used by approximately 50% of the U.S. refining capacity, as well as by leading midstream pipeline energy companies and major energy companies in Canada and Europe. This provides us with recurring maintenance and support fees and additional marketing opportunities for additional software and solutions.
MISTRAS also digitizes the transfer of field inspections to inspection data management systems (IDMS). MISTRAS Digital™ is an electronic platform that digitally delivers field inspection assignments and related data, captures inspection results, and delivers electronic reporting and productivity tracking via Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). MISTRAS Digital integrates with MISTRAS’ PCMS and other inspection data management systems to provide additional productivity improvements.

Access
Much of our work is conducted in hard-to-access locations, including those in at-height, subsea and confined locations. We utilize scaffolding and rope access to access at-height and confined assets; certified divers for subsea inspection and maintenance; and unmanned aerial, land-based and subsea systems for a wide range of inspection applications, with an emphasis on minimizing at-height access and confined space entry (CSE).
Monitoring
Our online condition-monitoring solutions provide real-time reports and analysis of infrastructure to alert facility personnel to damages before critical failures occur. These monitoring solutions are often installed in hazardous or hard-to-reach locations, helping to enhance safety by reducing the need to send technicians into unsafe locations. We offer monitoring solutions for a wide range of assets and applications, including:

• | Bridge Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)

5


• | Power Transformer Health & Reliability


• | Stator Vane Cracking


• | Through-Valve Leaking


• | Tube Leaking


• | Wall Thickness Tracking

We offer a variety of secure, web-based solutions that monitor structural integrity and analyze conditions against our library of historical inspection data, allowing users to stay aware of potential concerns and prioritize future inspections and maintenance. We also offer custom-developed software that integrates into onsite IDMSs, stores and trends monitoring data and provides immediate automated data analysis.
We provide continuous, periodic and conditional monitoring, depending on the type of asset and its operating condition. Continuous monitoring is applied on critical assets to observe the earliest onset of a defect to predict its progress and to track its progression to avoid catastrophic failure. Periodic monitoring, or “walk around” monitoring, is a preventative maintenance technique to observe changes in an asset's condition over a specified period of time. Conditional monitoring solutions are typically used when there is a known defect that needs to be monitored until the asset is repaired or replaced. 
Laboratory Quality Assurance/Control (QA/QC)
Our network of in-house laboratories located across North America and Europe offer quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) solutions for new and existing metal and alloy components, materials and composites.
Our in-house labs work with our clients throughout their components’ lifetimes, from preparation and production to post-processing and in-service component monitoring. MISTRAS’ laboratory QA/QC solutions help to meet customer needs throughout their manufacturing cycles, with a focus on optimizing production logistics. Our in-house lab solutions include:

• | Non-destructive testing (NDT)


• | Destructive testing (DT)


• | Metallurgical testing


• | Chemical analysis testing


• | Mechanical services


• | Pre-machining


• | Finishing services

We often inspect and test components prior to assembly to screen for defects and discontinuities introduced in the manufacturing process. We also inspect existing components to ensure they remain fit-for-purpose.
Our labs hold a wide variety of certifications that allow them to perform inspections to meet or exceed stringent regulatory requirements, such as: Nadcap (formerly NADCAP, the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program), AS9100/ISO-9001, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Repair Station, the International Traffice in Arms Regulations/Export Administration Regulations (ITAR/EAR) and manufacturers' requirements. With these certifications comes a comprehensive range of approvals from prime contractors of major projects, militaries, and internationally-renowned original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) from many of our key markets, including the oil and gas, aerospace and defense, power generation, and industrial markets. 
Equipment
We design and manufacture portable, handheld, wireless and turnkey NDT equipment, along with corresponding data acquisition sensors and software, for spot inspections and long-term, unattended monitoring applications.
We sell these solutions as individual components, or as complete systems, which include a combination of sensors, an amplifier, signal processing electronics, knowledge-based software and decision and feedback electronics. We also sell integrated service-and-system technology packages, in which our field technicians utilize our proprietary and specialized testing procedures and hardware, advanced pattern recognition, neural network software and databases to compare test results against our prior testing data or industry standards.
In addition to other NDT and vibration equipment, we provide a range of acoustic emission (AE) products and are a leader in the design and manufacture of AE sensors, instruments and turnkey systems used for monitoring and testing materials, pressure components, processes and structures.

ASSET PROTECTION INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Asset protection plays a crucial role in assuring the integrity and reliability of critical infrastructure. As an asset protection solutions provider, MISTRAS seeks to maximize the uptime and safety of critical infrastructure, by helping clients to detect, locate, mitigate and prevent damages such as corrosion, cracks, leaks, manufacturing flaws and other concerns to operating and structural integrity. In addition to these core utilities, the storage and analysis of collected inspection and mechanical integrity data is also a key aspect of asset protection.
NDT has historically been a prominent solution in the asset protection industry due to its capacity to detect defects without compromising the integrity of the tested materials or equipment. The supply of NDT inspection services has traditionally come from many small vendors, who provide services to a small geographic region. A trend has emerged, however, for customers to engage a select few vendors capable of providing a wider spectrum of asset protection solutions for global infrastructure, in addition to an increased demand for advanced non-destructive testing (ANDT) solutions and data acquisition software, both of which require a highly-trained workforce.
Due to these trends, those vendors offering integrated solutions, scalable operations skilled personnel and a global footprint will have a distinct competitive advantage. Moreover, we believe that vendors that are able to effectively deliver both advanced solutions and data analytics, by virtue of their access to customers’ data, create a significant barrier to entry for competitors, leading to the opportunity to further create significant recurring revenues.
Key Dynamics of the Asset Protection Industry
We believe the following represent key dynamics of the asset protection industry, and that the market available to us will continue to grow as these macro-market trends continue to develop:
Extending the Useful Life of Aging Infrastructure While Increasing Utilization. Due to the prohibitive costs and challenges of building new infrastructure, many companies have chosen to extend the useful life of existing assets through enhancements, 
7

rather than replacing these assets. This has resulted in the significant aging and increased utilization of existing infrastructure in our target markets. Increasing demand for refined petroleum products, combined with high plant-utilization rates, is driving refineries to upgrade facilities to make them more efficient and expand capacities. Because aging infrastructure requires more frequent inspection and maintenance in comparison to new infrastructure, companies and public authorities continue to spend on asset protection to ensure their aging infrastructure assets continue to operate effectively.
Outsourcing of Non-Core Activities and Technical Resource Constraints. Due to the increasing sophistication and automation of NDT programs, a decreasing supply of skilled professionals and increasing governmental regulations, companies are increasingly outsourcing NDT to third-party providers with advanced solution portfolios, engineering expertise and trained workforces.
Increasing Corrosion from Low-Quality Inputs. The increased availability and low cost of crude oil from areas such as shale plays and oil sands resources have led to the use of lower-grade raw materials and feedstock. This leads to higher rates of corrosion, especially in refining processes involving petroleum with higher sulfur content. This increases the need for asset protection solutions to detect and/or proactively prevent corrosion-related issues.
Increasing Use of Advanced Materials. Customers in various of our target markets - particularly aerospace and defense - are increasingly utilizing advanced materials, such as composites and other unique technologies in their assets. These materials often cannot be tested using traditional NDT techniques. We believe that demand for more advanced testing and assessment solutions will increase along with the demand for these advanced materials during the design, manufacturing, operating and quality control phases. 
Meeting Safety Regulations. Owners and operators of refineries, pipelines and petrochemical and chemical plants increasingly face strict government regulations and more stringent process safety enforcement standards. This includes the continued implementation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) National Emphasis Program (NEP). Failure to meet these standards can result in significant financial liabilities, increased scrutiny by government and industry regulators, higher insurance premiums and tarnished corporate brand value. As a result, these owners and operators are seeking highly-reliable asset protection suppliers with a track record of assisting organizations in meeting increasingly stringent regulations. Our clients benefit from MISTRAS’ extensive engineering consulting base that supports them in devising mechanical integrity programs that both meet regulatory compliance standards and enable enhanced safety and uptime at their facilities.
Expanding Addressable End-Markets. The continued emergence of and advances in asset protection technologies and software-based systems are increasing the demand for asset protection solutions in applications where existing techniques were previously ineffective.
Expanding Aerospace Industry. We believe that increased demand will continue to come from the aerospace industry due to the approximately decade-long backlog for next-generation commercial aircraft to be built, driving the need for advanced solutions that drive cost and quality efficiencies.
Crude Oil Prices. Throughout most of 2018, crude oil prices have continued to rebound, although during the last two months of 2018, they declined. They have already started to rebound in early 2019, and we believe that spending on maintenance shutdowns in 2019 should remain steady with 2018 levels. This demand will be balanced against the continued focus on process efficiencies and cost savings initiatives. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths contribute to our being a leading provider of asset protection solutions and will allow us to further capitalize on growth opportunities in our industry:
One Source Provider for Asset Protection Solutions®. We believe we have one of the most comprehensive portfolios of integrated asset protection solutions worldwide, which positions us to be the leading single-source provider for our customers’ asset protection requirements. This is particularly a competitive strength in regards to turnarounds and shutdowns - during which facilities temporarily cease operations in order to perform plant-wide inspections, maintenance and repairs - as these work stoppages make up significant portions of refinery, process and power plant maintenance budgets. Demand for our solutions increases during these outages, as facilities seek third-party providers to perform a wide spectrum of asset protection operations while the plant is offline. In addition, as companies are increasingly outsourcing their NDT needs to third-party providers, we believe that the ability to offer a comprehensive package of solutions provides us with a competitive advantage.
Long-Standing Trusted Provider to a Diversified and Growing Customer Base. We have become a trusted partner to a large and growing customer base across numerous global markets through our proven, decades-long track record of successful operations. Our customers include some of the largest and most well-recognized firms in the oil and gas, chemicals, power generation and aerospace and defense industries, as well as public authorities.

Through our enterprise data management and analysis software, PCMS, we have accumulated extensive, proprietary process data that allows us to provide our customers with value-added services, such as benchmarking, risk-based inspection (RBI) and reliability-centered maintenance (RCM).
Proprietary Products, Software and Technology Packages. Our deep knowledge base in asset protection services and equipment enable us to offer technology packages, in which our field technicians utilize our proprietary and specialized testing procedures and hardware, advanced pattern recognition, neural network software and databases to compare test results against our prior testing data or national and international structural integrity standards.
Deep Domain Knowledge and Extensive Industry Experience. We have extensive asset protection experience and data, dating back several decades of operations. We have gained this through our industry leadership in developing advanced asset protection solutions, including research and development of advanced NDT technologies and applications; process engineering technologies; online plant asset integrity management with sensor fusion; and enterprise software solutions for plant-wide and fleet-wide inspection data archiving and management.
Technological Research and Development. The NDT industry continues to move towards more advanced, automated solutions, requiring service providers to find safer and more cost-efficient inspection techniques. We believe that we remain ahead of the technological curve by backing our extensive industry expertise with the investment of resources in research and development (R&D). Some of the advanced inspection technologies developed by our internal R&D teams include an automated radiographic testing (aRT) crawler for corrosion under insulation (CUI) inspections in aboveground pipelines; our Large Structure Inspection (LSI) scanner; and our real-time radiography (RTR) crawler for 360° inspections of pipeline girth welds. 
Collaborating with Our Customers. We have historically expanded our asset protection solution portfolio in response to our customers’ unique performance specifications. Our technology packages have often been developed in close cooperation and partnership with key customers and industry organizations.
Experienced Management Team. Our management team has a track record of asset protection organizational leadership. These individuals also have successfully driven operational growth organically and through acquisitions, which we believe is important to facilitate future growth in the asset protection industry.
Our Growth Strategy
Our growth strategy emphasizes the following key elements:
Expand Our Focus in the Aerospace Industry. We believe that the introduction of next-generation airframes and aircraft engines has created an inherent demand for inspection, testing, machining and mechanical services required for the production of parts. The recent interest in the use of additive manufacturing techniques to create components also necessitates advanced inspection and testing solutions. The Company consummated two acquisitions of aerospace inspection companies in 2017 and won a key European contract in 2016. These recent actions are driven by our increased focus to provide solutions to our clients throughout their manufacturing value chains in this growing area.
Expand Our Focus in the Pipeline Integrity Industry. MISTRAS intends to continue broadening our solutions for the pipeline market. Recent industry regulations significantly expanded pipeline integrity management regulations, requiring pipeline owner/operators to inspect, document, and assess the risk of operating conditions for existing lines. This provide MISTRAS, with the opportunity to provide asset protection solutions for both the new construction and integrity phases. We acquired an inline inspection provider based in Canada in 2018 and have implemented our PCMS software for several pipeline operators to support their integrity data management.
Expanding our Mechanical Services Portfolio. We believe that performing mechanical services to complement inspections, such as removing and reapplying insulation or preparing surfaces for coating or painting, is an important market differentiator for us. This is particularly true when considering the cost-efficiencies our customers realize when our rope access technicians perform these services at height without the use of scaffolding. Many of our customers already require these services, but utilize multiple vendors to do so, creating an opportunity for us to provide greater value to a customer base that increasingly requires enhanced speed and efficiency.
Continue to Develop Technology-Enabled Asset Protection Solutions. We intend to maintain and enhance our technological leadership by continuing to invest in developing new technology, applications and data services. We intend to continue deepening synergies between our solutions to provide our customers with uniquely-integrated offerings, which we believe makes us a more attractive vendor for clients seeking to centralize their asset protection. We also intend to continue to develop technologies that enhance the flow of data throughout multiple operational phases and facilities.
Expand our Solution Offerings to Existing Customers. We believe that branching into adjacent, complementary services, such as mechanical services, increases our value proposition and our ability to capture additional business. Many of our customers 
9

are multinational corporations with asset protection requirements at multiple locations. We believe that expanding our solution offerings, combined with the trend of customers outsourcing asset protection to service providers with integrated offerings, provides opportunities for significant additional recurring revenues.
Continue to Expand Our Customer Base into New End Markets. We believe we have significant opportunities to expand our customer base in relatively new end markets, including wind and other alternative energy, natural gas transportation industries pipeline integrity and additive manufacturing. The expansion of our addressable markets is being driven by the increased recognition and adoption of advanced asset protection technologies that are supplanting traditional methods.
Continue to Capitalize on Acquisitions. We intend to continue employing a disciplined acquisition strategy to supplement and enhance our solutions, add new customers, expand our sales channels and accelerate our growth. We believe the market contains many potential acquisition opportunities, enhanced by an increasing desire on the part of customers for a single source provider of solutions.

Our Target Markets

Overview

Mistras operates in a highly competitive, but fragmented market. Domestically, the market is serviced by several national competitors, and many regional and/or local companies.   Internationally, our primary competitors are divisions of large companies, with additional competition from small independent local companies which may be limited to a specific product, service or technology and focused on a niche market or geographic region. We focus our strategic sales, marketing and product development efforts on a range of infrastructure-intensive based industries and governmental authorities. We view energy-related infrastructure and commercial aerospace as the Company's largest market opportunities.  We perform inspection and mechanical services for customers in both industries.

In the energy market there are various economic indicators that drive our business, especially in the U.S. domestic markets. These factors are excerpted below from various Energy Information Administration (EIA) outlook reports;
The continued decline in natural gas prices and increasing penetration of renewable electricity generation have resulted in lower wholesale electricity prices and operating losses for coal and nuclear generators.  In addition, environmental concerns continue to negatively affect coal as a viable source of electricity generation. The use of natural gas as an energy source is projected to grow the most on an absolute basis. Per the Energy Information Agency's (EIA) December 14, 2018, crude oil output was 11.6 million barrels per day (bpd) and increased to 11.7 bpd by the end of the year, the highest level for any year on record in the United States. In addition, the EIA estimates that production of U.S. crude oil and natural gas plant liquids continues its growth through 2025, with oil production records predicted through 2027 that top 14 million bpd through 2040. Crude pricing remains highly uncertain due to international market conditions. However, U.S. refinery utilization peaks in 2020 at approximately 96%. 
There are a number of economic factors which drive the aerospace market, including:

• | The approximately decade-long backlog for next generation commercial aircraft to be built, including several large and mid-sized aircraft built by Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and Embraer, among other manufacturers;

10


• | The backlog of next generation aircraft engines which operate with greater fuel efficiency, including the LEAP engine and the geared-turbo fan engine;


• | The continuing regulatory scrutiny to ensure public safety associated with these new technologically advanced aircraft, which serves to ensure the continued need for inspection and mechanical services to be performed, as well as to limit the number of participants who can meet the demanding requirements associated with performing these services.

Revenue by Target Market

The following chart represents the percentage of consolidated revenues we generated from our various markets for the year ended December 31, 2018:
Mistras Revenues by Target Market
(Year ended December 31, 2018)
Oil and Gas
MISTRAS supplies oil and gas asset protection solutions to downstream (refining), midstream (transportation and storage), upstream (exploration and production) and petrochemical operations.
We use our vast solutions portfolio to help identify current and future asset performance, and actively prevent, mitigate or otherwise address potential issues, including corrosion, cracking, leaking and other damages that may lead to safety, productivity or environmental concerns. Our solutions help identify conditions that could lead to potential catastrophic failures in tanks, vessels, valves, buried and above ground pipelines, pumps, motors, compressors and other critical assets found throughout the oil & gas production and delivery supply chain. 
We actively seek to evolve our solutions through technological enhancements and R&D to discover new applications. Online monitoring and permanently-mounted sensors, as well as the use of drones and other alternative delivery devices, are all being considered as oil and gas infrastructure owners look to “smart” technologies that reduce human intervention while delivering highly-accurate inspection & integrity data. We also have actively sought to further enhance our integrated approach to asset protection, through the development of our complementary mechanical service portfolio.
In general, the energy market is poised to leverage digital solutions to facilitate process improvements as well as increase plant reliability and improve process and personnel safety. This provides an opportunity for the Company to synergistically leverage our asset protection solutions into our new MISTRAS Digital platform. Digital transmission of data in various industry sectors, with built-in analytic functions, shall allow our clients to better leverage inspection data that is being generated in the field.
11

While we expect off-stream inspection of critical assets to remain a routine practice, we anticipate an increase in the demand for non-invasive, or on-stream inspections. Non-invasive inspections enable companies to minimize the costs associated with shutting down equipment during testing, while enabling the economic and safety advantages of advanced planning and/or predictive maintenance.
Aerospace and Defense
The aerospace industry is undergoing unprecedented growth with many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) reporting record-high backlogs of up to ten years. We serve this rapidly-growing target market by providing a full range of inspection, testing, machining, mechanical, finishing, additive manufacturing and equipment solutions, which we are Nadcap certified. Our state-of-the-art in-house labs maintain numerous accreditations from industry organizations, including Nadcap and some of the largest prime manufacturers in the world, such as Boeing, Safran, Airbus, Bombardier and Embraer.
Advanced composite materials found in new classes of aircraft require advanced asset protection solutions, including x-ray of critical engine components, ultrasonic fatigue testing of complete aircraft structures and corrosion detection and other critical components. Many OEMs are shifting towards condition-based maintenance utilizing embedded monitoring sensors to track component structural and operational integrity over time as opposed to performing maintenance on time-based intervals. We expect demand for our solutions to increase with the adoption of these new-age materials and distributed online sensor networks. We also expect demand for asset protection solutions to increase with the continued adoption of additive manufacturing techniques. 
Industrial
The quality control requirements driven by the need for zero-to-low-defect component tolerance within automated, robotic-intensive industries such as automotive, consumer electronics and medical industries serve as key drivers for increased demand in asset protection, particularly for in-house inspection and testing. We expect that increasingly stringent quality-control requirements and competitive forces will drive the demand for more-costly finishing and polishing which, in turn, creates opportunities for integrated partnerships between MISTRAS and our clients throughout the production lifecycle.
Power Generation and Transmission
MISTRAS provides asset protection solutions for clients in the combined cycle, fossil, nuclear, transmission & distribution and wind/alternative energy industries. We believe that in recent years, acceptance of asset protection solutions has grown in this industry due to the aging of critical power generation and transmission infrastructure.
The growing availability of cheap natural gas, along with environmental concerns with coal, has stimulated the construction of new natural gas-fired power plants across North America, creating opportunities for MISTRAS to provide specialized solutions in multiple phases. These include facility design consultations, NDT services during construction and plant operations and long-term condition monitoring. We anticipate sharp growth in the plants as natural gas pricing remains low, and the environmental impacts of coal remain unattractive to the public. 
Process Industries
Our asset protection solutions are crucial for process industries, or industries in which raw materials are treated or prepared in a series of stages, including chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food processing, pulp and paper and metals and mining. As the process facilities are increasingly facing aging infrastructure, high utilization, growing capacity constraints and increasing capital costs, we believe asset protection solutions will continue to grow in importance in maintenance planning, quality and cost control and prevention of catastrophic failure.
Public Infrastructure, Research and Engineering
We believe that high-profile infrastructure catastrophes have caused public authorities to more actively seek ways to prevent similar events from occurring. Public authorities tasked with new construction and maintenance of existing public infrastructure increasingly use asset protection solutions to inspect these assets, including the use of embedded sensors to enable online monitoring throughout the life of the asset.
We have provided testing and structural health monitoring (SHM) solutions on bridges and structures worldwide, including some of the largest and most well-known bridges in the United States and United Kingdom. Our sensors continuously monitor these assets, alerting owner/operators when defects are detected. Our monitoring teams also provide regular reports that include early warnings of suspect areas before an alarm is generated.
Customers

12

We provide our asset protection solutions to a global customer base of diverse companies primarily in our target markets. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2018. One customer, BP plc., accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 10% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, the transition period ended December 31, 2016 and fiscal 2016, respectively.
Geographic Areas
We have operations in 10 countries and occasionally conduct business in a few other countries. Most of our revenues are derived from our U.S., Canadian and European operations. See Note 19 — Segment Disclosure to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further disclosure of our revenues, long-lived assets and other financial information regarding our international operations.
Sales and Marketing

We sell our asset protection solutions through our direct sales and marketing teams within all of our offices worldwide. In addition, our project and laboratory managers as well as our management are trained on our solutions and often are the source of sales leads and customer contacts. Our direct sales and marketing teams work closely with our customers’ research and design personnel, reliability engineers and facilities maintenance engineers to demonstrate the benefits and capabilities of our asset protection solutions, refine our asset protection solutions based on changing market and customer needs and identify potential sales opportunities. We divide our sales and marketing efforts into services sales, products and systems sales and marketing and utilize customer relationship management (CRM) systems to collect, manage and collaborate customer information with our teams globally. Our CRM's also provide critical data to provide accurate forecasting and reporting. 
Manufacturing

Most of our hardware products are manufactured in our Princeton Junction, New Jersey facility. Our Princeton Junction facility includes the capabilities and personnel to fully produce all of our AE products and NDT Automation Ultrasonic equipment. We also design and manufacture automated ultrasonic systems and scanners in France.
Employees

Providing our asset protection solutions requires a highly-skilled and technically proficient employee base. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 5,700 employees worldwide, of which approximately 61% were based in the United States. Less than 1% of our employees in the United States are unionized. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
Seasonality

Our business is seasonal. This seasonality relates primarily to our oil and gas business. U.S. refineries’ non-peak periods are generally in the fall, when they are retooling to produce more heating oil for winter, and in the spring, when they are retooling to produce more gasoline for summer. The peak periods for these customers are the summer and winter months, when they run at peak capacity and are not retooling or performing turnarounds or shut downs. As a result, our revenues in the summer and winter months are typically lower than our revenues in the fall and spring because demand for our asset protection solutions from the oil and gas as well as the fossil and nuclear power industries increases during their non-peak production periods. Because we are increasing our work in the fall and spring, our cash flows are lower in those quarters than in the summer and winter, as collections of receivables lag behind revenues. We expect that this seasonality will continue.
Competition

We operate in a highly competitive, but fragmented, market. Our primary competitors are divisions of large companies and various small companies which generally are limited to a specific product or technology and focused on a niche market or geographic region. We believe that few, if any, of our competitors currently provide the full range of asset protection and NDT products, enterprise software (PCMS) and the traditional and advanced services solutions that we offer. Our competition with respect to NDT services include the Acuren division of Rockwood Service Corporation, SGS Group, the Team Qualspec division of Team, Inc. and APPLUS RTD. Our competition with respect to our PCMS software includes UltraPIPE, Lloyd’s Register Capstone, Inc. and Meridium Systems. In the traditional NDT market, we believe the principal competitive factors include project management, availability of qualified personnel, execution, price, reputation and quality; whereas in the advanced NDT market, reputation, quality and size tend to be the most significant competitive factors. We believe that the NDT market has significant barriers to entry which would make it difficult for new competitors to enter the market. These barriers include: (1) having to acquire or develop advanced NDT services, products and systems technologies, which in our case 
13

occurred over many years of customer engagements and at significant internal research and development expense, (2) complex regulations and safety codes that require significant industry experience, (3) license requirements and evolved quality and safety programs, (4) costly and time-consuming certification processes, (5) capital requirements and (6) emphasis by large customers on size and critical mass, length of relationship and past service record.
Research and Development 
Our research and development is principally conducted by engineers and scientists at our Princeton Junction, New Jersey headquarters, and supplemented by other employees in the United States and throughout the world, including France, Greece the United Kingdom, Brazil and the Netherlands. Our total professional staff includes employees who hold Ph.D.’s and engineers and employees who hold Level III certification, the highest level of certification from the American Society of Non-Destructive Testing (ASNT).
MISTRAS makes strategic R&D investments in technologies that support integration with our other solution offerings to enhance cost- and time-efficiencies, maximize uptime and safety and improve the flow of data from field technicians to inspection databases. We are investing resources in the development of MISTRAS Digital, an electronic platform that will digitally deliver field inspection assignments and related data, capture inspection results, and provide electronic reporting and productivity tracking. MISTRAS also invested significant R&D in pre-machining and advanced testing technologies in a purpose-built facility for an aerospace customer, with the goal of reducing the customer’s production cycle logistics and costs.
We also work with customers to develop new products or applications for our technology, including:

• | Testing of new composites


• | Detecting crack propagation


• | Wireless and communications technologies


• | Development of permanently embedded inspection systems to provide continuous, online, in-service monitoring of critical structural components

Research and development expenses are reflected on our consolidated statements of income as research and engineering expenses. Our company-sponsored research and engineering expenses were approximately $3.3 million, $2.3 million, $1.6 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the transition period ended December 31, 2016 and fiscal 2016, respectively. While we have historically funded most of our research and development expenditures, from time to time we also receive customer-sponsored research and development funding. Most of the projects are in our target markets; however, a few of the projects could lead to other future market opportunities.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We utilize a combination of intellectual property safeguards, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as employee and third-party confidentiality agreements, to protect our intellectual property.
As of December 31, 2018, we held 4 U.S. patents (by direct ownership or exclusive licensing) which will expire at various times between 2021 and 2026 and 2 patents pending in the U.S. for applications filed in 2018, and license certain other patents. However, we do not principally rely on these patents or licenses to provide our proprietary asset protection solutions. Our trademarks and service marks provide us and our solutions with a certain amount of brand recognition in our markets. We do not consider any single patent, trademark or service mark material to our financial condition or results of operations.
As of December 31, 2018, the primary trademarks and service marks that we held in the United States included MISTRAS® and our stylized globe design. Other trademarks or service marks that we utilize in localized markets or product advertising include:

• | One Source for Asset Protection Solutions®


• | PCMS®


• | Physical Acoustics and the PAC logo


• | Streamview™


• | Ropeworks®


• | Sensor Highway™


• | Streamview


• | TankPAC®


• | CALIPERAY™


• | VPAC

• | Transformer Clinic™

Many elements of our asset protection solutions involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications because they are not patentable or would be difficult to enforce, including technical processes, equipment designs, algorithms and procedures. We believe that this proprietary know-how, technology and data is the most important component of our intellectual property used in our asset protection solutions, and is a primary differentiator of our solutions from those of our competitors. We rely on various trade secret protection techniques and agreements with our customers, service providers and vendors to protect these assets. All of our employees are subject to confidentiality requirements through our employee handbook. In addition, many of our employees have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us. Our employee handbook and these agreements require our employees not to use or disclose our confidential information, to assign to us all of the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us and to otherwise address intellectual property protection issues. We also seek confidentiality agreements from our customers and business partners before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technologies or business strategies. We are not currently involved in any material intellectual property claims.
Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous environmental, legal and regulatory requirements related to our operations worldwide. In the United States, these laws and regulations include, among others: the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Atomic Energy Act, the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, and applicable regulations. In addition to the federal laws and regulations, states and other countries where we do business often have numerous environmental, legal and regulatory requirements by which we must abide. We evaluate and address the environmental impact of our operations by assessing properties in order to avoid future liabilities and comply with environmental, legal and regulatory requirements.
We received a notice in May 2015 that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) performed a preliminary assessment of a leased facility we operate in Cudahy, California. Based upon the preliminary assessment, the EPA conducted an investigation of the site. The purpose of the investigation is to determine whether any hazardous materials were released from the facility. We were informed that certain hazardous materials and pollutants have been found in the ground water in the general vicinity of the site and the EPA is attempting to ascertain the origination or source of these materials and pollutants. Given the historic industrial use of the site, the EPA determined that the site of our Cudahy facility should be examined along with numerous other sites in the vicinity. In addition, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control recently notified the owner of the property that it may perform additional investigation of the property. At this time, we are not able to determine whether we have any liability in connection with this matter and if so, the amount or range of any such liability.
