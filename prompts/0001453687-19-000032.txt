Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using our ImmTOR technology, designed to induce tolerance to novel biologic therapies that would otherwise be limited by immunogenicity with the goal of effectively and safely treating rare and serious diseases. Many such diseases are treated with biologic therapies that are foreign to the patient’s immune system and therefore elicit an undesired immune response. Of particular concern are anti-drug antibodies, or ADAs, which are often produced by the immune system in response to biologic therapy and can adversely affect the efficacy and safety of treatment. Our proprietary tolerogenic ImmTOR technology encapsulates an immunomodulator in biodegradable nanoparticles and is designed to mitigate the formation of ADAs by inducing antigen-specific immune tolerance to biologic drugs. ADAs can start developing in the body with the first dose of a biologic therapy and can render subsequent doses ineffective or unsafe, potentially depriving patients of life-saving therapeutic options and limiting the likelihood of success for many otherwise promising novel biologic drugs and technologies. We believe ImmTOR has potential to enhance the efficacy without compromising the safety of existing approved biologic drugs, improve product candidates under development and enable novel therapeutic modalities, such as re-administration of systemic gene therapy. We intend to build a product pipeline by combining our ImmTOR technology with a range of biologics and also plan to seek collaborations and license agreements to broaden our applications for the platform.
Our most advanced product candidate, SEL-212, is a proprietary combination of a therapeutic uricase enzyme (pegadricase) and our ImmTOR technology that is designed to durably control serum uric acid levels in patients with chronic refractory gout through monthly administration. Our preclinical data indicate that ImmTOR, when co-administered with pegadricase, induced antigen-specific immune tolerance to pegadricase and substantially reduced the formation of associated ADAs. Our Phase 1 data showed that ImmTOR mitigated the formation of ADAs against pegadricase after a single dose of SEL-212. Interim Phase 2 clinical data as of December 17, 2018 suggest the potential of monthly doses of SEL-212 to durably control serum uric acid levels by mitigating the formation of anti-pegadricase antibodies. Initial tissue imaging studies by dual energy computerized tomography (CT) scans also provided evidence regarding the potential of SEL-212 to rapidly eliminate tissue deposits of monosodium urate crystals. These interim data also showed a low rate of gout flare rates. Based on our current Phase 2 clinical data and feedback received from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, during our end-of-Phase 2 meeting we plan to commence enrollment and initiate dosing in our head-to-head (COMPARE) clinical trial of SEL-212, utilizing revised stopping rules, compared to the current FDA-approved uricase therapy, KRYSTEXXA®, in the first quarter of 2019. We expect our clinical and, if approved, marketing strategy for SEL-212 to initially focus on the estimated 160,000 patients in the United States with chronic refractory gout that are being treated by rheumatologists.
We are also applying our ImmTOR technology in an effort to mitigate the formation of ADAs when dosing gene therapy. Gene therapies often use a viral vector, such as an adeno-associated virus, or AAV, vector to place corrective genetic material into cells to treat genetic diseases. One of the key hurdles for the gene therapy field is to overcome immunogenicity against the viral vector. ADAs form in response to the first administration of a gene therapy vector and prevent effective subsequent doses of gene therapy. The ability to provide repeat doses may be particularly important for pediatric patients to receive continued treatment benefit later in life as gene expression wanes due to cellular turnover as patients grow. The ability to re-administer gene therapies also could provide the potential for dose titration and could be advantageous for diseases where the goal is to transfect a high number of cells. 
Our first proprietary investigational gene therapy program is targeted to treat a rare genetic disease, Methylmalonic Acidemia, or MMA, pursuant to which we are collaborating with a clinical and gene therapy laboratory at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and The Schepens Eye Institute, Inc., which we collectively refer to as MEE. We have in-licensed the Anc80 gene therapy vector, or Anc80, from MEE. Anc80 is an engineered vector that has been reported to have limited cross-reactivity to antibodies against wild type AAV serotypes. In preclinical studies, Anc80 has shown potency as a gene therapy vector. We believe our product candidate, if successfully developed and approved, has the potential to prevent undesired immune responses to the vector and transgene that can occur with the first dose of gene therapy by using our ImmTOR technology. In January 2017, we entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement with Lonza Houston, Inc. Under our license agreement with MEE, we also have the exclusive option to develop gene therapies using Anc80 for several additional diseases including lysosomal storage, muscular and genetic metabolic diseases. For more information, see "Licenses and Collaborations - Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary” below.
In addition to developing this proprietary non-immunogenic therapeutic candidate, we intend to continue expanding our proprietary immune tolerance pipeline and pursue out-licensing opportunities for select applications of our ImmTOR technology. In December 2016, we entered into a license agreement, or the Spark License Agreement, with Spark Therapeutics, 
Inc., or Spark, that provides Spark with exclusive worldwide rights to our ImmTOR technology to research, develop and commercialize gene therapies for Factor VIII, an essential blood clotting protein relevant to the treatment of hemophilia A, which is the initial target under the agreement, as well as exclusive options for up to four additional pre-specified targets. For more information, see “Licenses and Collaborations - Spark Therapeutics" below.
In September 2018, we announced a collaboration with the European consortium, CureCN, for an ImmTOR+AAV gene therapy combination product candidate in Crigler-Najjar Syndrome. We expect CureCN to initiate preclinical toxicology studies in the first half of 2019 and for the combination product candidate to enter the clinic in the second half of the year. 
In addition to this renewed focus on our AAV gene therapy applications, we are deprioritizing our SEL-403 Phase 1 oncology program. The trial, which was placed on clinical hold by the FDA, was being conducted by the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.
OUR STRATEGY
Our goal is to become the first biopharmaceutical company to develop and commercialize targeted therapies that are designed to more effectively and safely treat rare and serious diseases by inducing immune tolerance to potent but immunogenic biologic therapies. In addition, we intend to maximize the value of our ImmTOR technology by collaborating with biopharmaceutical companies on programs that can benefit from our technology but that are outside our area of focus. The key elements of our strategy include the following.

• | Advance the development of SEL-212 for the treatment of chronic refractory gout. We believe SEL-212 has the potential, if successfully developed and approved, to become the first monthly biologic treatment that durably controls uric acid while also dissolving harmful deposits of uric acid crystals for a majority of patients with chronic refractory gout. We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical program, comprised of two completed Phase 1 clinical studies and an ongoing Phase 2 clinical program. We expect to commence enrollment for our head-to-head (COMPARE) clinical study against Krystexxa in the first quarter of 2019 and expect to have interim six-month data in the fourth quarter of 2019, and data from statistical superiority endpoints expected to be available in the first quarter of 2020. The two armed, open label trial is projected to enroll between 120-150 patients per arm, with one arm receiving Krystexxa (per label) and the other arm receiving six monthly doses of SEL-212. The primary endpoint in the study is the percentage of patients in each arm that maintain serum uric acid control below 6 mg/dL at the six month endpoint. The results of the head-to-head (COMPARE) clinical trial are expected to inform the design of our planned Phase 3 clinical trials of SEL-212, which we plan to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2019. 


• | Transform gene therapy by enabling repeated administration of systemically-administered AAV gene therapy vectors. One of the key challenges for the gene therapy field is the inability to administer more than one dose of AAV systemically due to the formation of neutralizing anti-AAV antibodies. We believe redosing has the potential to enable dose titration of gene therapy to achieve therapeutic expression of the transgene, to restore therapeutic expression in pediatric patients that have lost expression of the transgene due to target organ growth. A 2018 publication in Nature Communications provided peer-reviewed preclinical data supporting ImmTOR’s potential to mitigate the formation of neutralizing anti-AAV antibodies and enable productive AAV vector redosing in mice and nonhuman primates. 


• | Leverage ImmTOR to develop additional novel uses and classes of non-immunogenic biologics. We intend to use our ImmTOR technology to develop a range of proprietary, non-immunogenic biologic therapeutic candidates. In each case, ImmTOR would be evaluated for its potential to mitigate undesired immune response to the biologic therapy with the goal of improving efficacy and/or safety. Our strategy is to develop proprietary treatments for rare and serious diseases by combining ImmTOR with biologics that have been in- licensed or provided through research collaborations. 


• | Establish infrastructure and capabilities to commercialize our products in rare and orphan diseases. While we believe our ImmTOR technology may be broadly applicable across disease areas, we intend to focus our proprietary efforts on developing and commercializing proprietary ImmTOR -enabled products for rare and serious diseases where there is high unmet medical need. Therapies for treating these diseases require focused commercial efforts and coordination with patient groups and investigators. As our first product candidate, SEL-212, advances toward Phase 3 clinical trials and potential commercialization, we intend to build a commercial infrastructure to capture its full value. 


• | Selectively pursue collaborations and maximize the value of our ImmTOR programs for immune tolerance. In addition to our own proprietary product development efforts, we are in discussions with potential collaborators and licensees to pursue novel therapies that would utilize our ImmTOR technology. For example, in December 2016, we entered into the Spark License Agreement to develop gene therapies for certain targets utilizing our ImmTOR technology. For more information, see “Licenses and Collaborations - Spark Therapeutics." In September of 2018 we also announced a collaboration with CureCN, a European non-profit developing an AAV gene therapy for the treatment of Crigler Najjar Syndrome, an ultra-rare disease of iron metabolism mediated by a single gene deletion of a liver enzyme. The consortium plans to utilize our ImmTOR technology in combination with their AAV gene therapy with the potential to re-dose patients who are not producing enough enzyme post their first dose of AAV gene therapy. Preclinical toxicology studies are expected to begin in the first half of 2019, with the potential for initiation of preclinical/clinical combination studies in the second half of 2019. 

OVERVIEW OF THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM
The human immune system is an integrated system of specialized immune cells, cell products and tissues that protect against infectious disease and cancer. The immune system recognizes antigens, which are substances, such as proteins, enzymes or complex sugars. These antigens can be endogenous, or self-antigens, which are produced by the body, or exogenous antigens derived from foreign sources, such as viruses, fungi or bacteria. The human immune system has evolved to recognize and destroy potentially harmful substances. To function effectively, the immune system must discern between harmful antigens and innocuous antigens. The immune system maintains a delicate balance between effector cells, which mount immune responses to antigens that represent potential threats, and regulatory cells, which mitigate undesired and potentially harmful immune responses through immune tolerance. Depending upon the characteristics of the antigen and the context in which the antigen is encountered, the immune system must determine whether to mount a defensive (effector) or regulatory (tolerogenic) immune response.
Antigens are processed in lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes and the spleen, where the immune system determines whether to mount a defensive or regulatory response through a process called “antigen presentation.” In connection with antigen presentation, dendritic cells process the antigens and present them to T cells. When presented, antigens perceived as harmful induce a stimulatory response that can result in the activation of cytolytic T cells or helper T cells, the latter of which help to induce B cells to produce antibodies. The role of cytolytic T cells is to kill cells that harbor intracellular antigens, such as viruses. The role of antibodies is to neutralize or eliminate extracellular antigens on cell surfaces or in interstitial fluids, such as plasma. Figure 1 below depicts both antigen presentation and the related immune responses.
Figure 1. Antigen Presentation and Related Tolerogenic or Stimulatory Immune Response
There are a number of adverse outcomes that can occur when the immune system mounts an undesired response to an innocuous foreign antigen or a self-antigen. For example, food allergy occurs when the immune system mounts an immune response to innocuous food antigens. Another example of undesired immunogenicity occurs when the immune system is exposed to a biologic treatment, recognizes it as a foreign antigen and instructs the body to mount a defense by forming ADAs to the biologic, which can compromise a therapy’s desired beneficial effect. Undesired immunogenicity is common with biologic therapies, such as in enzyme and protein replacement therapies, and in novel technologies, such as gene therapy and antibody-drug conjugates.
A number of therapies have been developed to modulate an immune response. These therapies fall into two categories:

• | Immunosuppressive therapies. Immunosuppressive therapies are designed to suppress the immune system and inhibit an undesired immune response. However, many current therapies are not antigen-specific and, as a result, broadly suppress the immune system leading to undesired side effects that include opportunistic infections, skin cancer and lymphomas. We believe there is an opportunity to develop therapies that instruct the immune system to mitigate the formation of ADAs in an antigen-specific manner and remain tolerant to the specific antigen, thereby mitigating off-target effects of systemic immunosuppression. 


• | Immunostimulatory therapies. Immunostimulatory therapies are designed to stimulate the immune system to prevent or treat infections and cancers. The most common class of immunostimulatory therapies are vaccines, which are designed to simulate the body’s immune system to mount a defensive response to a specific antigen. While traditional vaccines have been successful for the prevention of infectious diseases, there has been limited success in developing therapeutic vaccines for the successful treatment of certain other diseases, including chronic infections and cancer. As a result, we believe there is a need for more effective vaccines to treat these diseases. 

OUR ImmTOR TECHNOLOGY
Our ImmTOR technology is based in part on the pioneering research performed by our co-founders at Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, or Brigham. In connection with our company’s founding, we licensed 17 patent families related to several aspects of our ImmTOR technology from our co-founders’ institutions pursuant to an agreement with MIT, the party that administers licensing arrangements with respect to patents jointly owned by these institutions. We believe one of the key insights from this research is that nanoparticles are uniquely suited to deliver precise instructions to the immune system as a result of the natural predisposition of the immune system to interrogate nanoparticles, such as viruses. This research led to a portfolio of patents and patent applications covering aspects of our ImmTOR technology. We have aggressively sought to extend and protect the proprietary intellectual property underlying the composition and use of ImmTOR for antigen-specific immunotolerance. For more information, see "Intellectual Property" below.
We are currently developing our ImmTOR technology for:

• | combination with a uricase enzyme for the treatment of chronic refractory gout;


• | combination with gene therapies for the treatment of rare diseases;


• | potential application with other marketed products, product candidates in development and novel biologic drugs that would otherwise be too immunogenic to develop

Our SVP nanoparticles are designed to remain intact after injection into the body and accumulate selectively in lymphoid organs, which include lymph nodes and the spleen, where the immune response is coordinated. They are designed to be processed by specialized immune cells, such as dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells that initiate and regulate immune responses, where they deliver the immunomodulator in a coordinated and targeted manner. Depending on the type of immunomodulator encapsulated in the SVP, our technology is designed to induce a tolerogenic response to mitigate the formation of ADAs against a biologic drug or to treat allergies and autoimmune diseases.
OUR ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC IMMUNE TOLERANCE PROGRAM
Our antigen-specific tolerance programs utilize ImmTOR, our biodegradable nanoparticle encapsulating the immunomodulator rapamycin. Rapamycin is a small molecule approved for the prevention of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients. To mitigate the formation of ADAs and induce immune tolerance in the body, we co-administer our ImmTOR with a free antigen, such as a biologic drug, which is depicted in Figure 2 below.
Figure 2. Co-Administration of ImmTOR with a Biologic Drug
ImmTOR is designed to be co-administered (prior to the biologic drug) at the beginning of therapy with a biologic drug to mitigate the formation of ADAs without requiring the alteration of the drug or its dose regimen. As a result, we believe our ImmTOR may provide us with significant opportunities in the areas of immune tolerance and ADA prevention because ImmTOR is designed to be co-administered at the beginning of therapy with many different biologic drugs. Importantly, we believe each pairing of ImmTOR with a biologic drug also offers us the opportunity to pursue a distinct proprietary product candidate, which we believe has the potential to be separately patented, approved and marketed. ImmTOR is manufactured in facilities subject to current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements using well-defined commercial operations, which, we believe, further enhances the scalability of our tolerance programs.
During preclinical studies, we observed that delivering an antigen together with ImmTOR provided the appropriate signals in vivo to induce regulatory T cells, which, in turn, inhibited effector immune responses, such as the formation of ADAs. In our preclinical studies, we observed that ImmTOR labeled with a fluorescent dye selectively accumulated in lymphoid organs where it was processed by antigen-presenting cells. Figure 3 below depicts a model of how ImmTOR would enter a lymph node and be taken up by a dendritic cell. We believe that when delivered in the context of our ImmTOR , both the biologic drug and ImmTOR are taken up and processed by dendritic cells in a manner that may induce regulatory T cells, which can potentially block the activation of helper T cells, mitigating the formation of ADAs.
Figure 3. ImmTOR and Antigen/Biologic Drug Presentation and Related Immune Tolerance Induction
Limitations of existing therapies
All biologics, even those comprised of human protein sequences, have the potential to induce ADAs. Whether a biologic drug elicits an ADA response depends on both product-specific factors, such as propensity to form aggregates, the route of administration and mechanism of action, as well as patient-specific factors, such as genetics, underlying disease and medications. For instance, many enzyme and protein replacement therapies used in the treatment of rare and serious diseases have a particularly high rate of immunogenicity because patients are genetically deficient in the target protein and, as a result, the therapeutic protein can be recognized as foreign by the patient’s immune system.
The formation of ADAs can lead to neutralization of efficacy, modification of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as allergic responses. Immunogenicity remains a significant hurdle for the development of safe and effective biologic treatments and has become a key concern for regulators, as evidenced by over 100 approved biologics that describe immunogenicity in their labels or clinical literature. According to product package inserts, approximately 50 currently marketed biologics report an incidence of ADAs affecting over 20% of patients. Among these biologics are Factor VIII products, such as Advate® (antihemophilic factor) for the treatment of hemophilia A and antibody therapeutics with fully human sequences, such as Humira® (adalimumab). We believe that immunogenicity also is a leading cause of product development failure for biopharmaceutical companies and that this issue is hampering the development of novel platform technologies, such as gene therapy and gene editing.
Undesired immunogenicity represents a significant hurdle that can hamper the clinical development of new biologic platforms. For example, in gene therapy, viral vectors are required to transport the genetic material into cells. The viral origin of these vectors explains their immunogenicity, which has led drug developers to limit applications to situations where the required frequency and site of administration are conducive to manageable immune responses.
Treatment and product development failure resulting from undesired immunogenicity has been recognized by regulators and patient advocacy organizations. In June 2014, the FDA and the National Organization for Rare Diseases, or NORD, co-sponsored a workshop on undesired immune responses to enzyme replacement therapies and called on the biopharmaceutical industry to take a more proactive approach to addressing immunogenicity to biologics.
Currently, we believe there are no comprehensive solutions to the complications of immunogenicity. Drug developers often stop the development of biologics that show an undesired immune response during preclinical or clinical development. In some cases, biopharmaceutical companies may attempt to reduce undesired immune responses by re-engineering the biologic through protein pegylation or removal of immunogenic epitopes. However, these approaches are limited in their effectiveness. Physicians may try to address the issue of undesired immune responses by increasing the dose of the biologic, which can be prohibitively expensive and may present greater safety concerns, or in life-threatening situations, by using global immunosuppressive combination therapies. We believe that our tolerogenic ImmTOR technology could offer an entirely new and effective treatment alternative for undesired immune responses, including with respect to the formation of ADAs, but potentially also for autoimmune diseases and allergies.
OUR IMMTOR PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO INDUCE ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC IMMUNE TOLERANCE
We believe our ImmTOR technology designed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance has a broad range of potential applications. We are currently pursuing targeted product development strategies for multiple applications in which we believe ImmTOR products could be highly differentiated.

• | Therapeutic enzymes. Therapeutic enzymes are a frequently used class of biologic drugs to treat rare diseases. Through our analysis of biologic drugs, including our preclinical studies, we have observed that enzymes are especially prone to undesired immune responses. Our first product candidate, SEL-212, includes pegadricase, a pegylated uricase enzyme, which is an example of an immunogenic enzyme for which we are applying ImmTOR with the intention of improving the enzyme’s efficacy and safety. Other examples of immunogenic enzymes include acid alpha-glucosidase for the treatment of Pompe disease, alpha galactosidase A for the treatment of Fabry’s disease and microbial enzymes such as asparaginase for the treatment of cancers. We intend to seek opportunities to secure supply of and, if appropriate, licenses to these or other enzymes that we would evaluate in combination with ImmTOR. 


• | Gene therapies. We believe gene therapies have the potential to address key unmet medical needs for many rare genetic diseases, but undesired immune responses to the viral vectors used for gene replacement, augmentation and editing may be restricting their broader use. Through our analysis of genetic diseases, we have identified applications and patient segments that we believe would benefit from our ImmTOR technology. We intend to develop proprietary ImmTOR -enabled non-immunogenic gene therapy candidates with viral vectors such as the Anc80 vector that we have licensed from MEE, but which are also designed to be utilized with more common AAV vectors (e.g., AAV8, AAV5). We believe our product candidates have the potential to mitigate the problem of pre-existing immunogenicity to the gene therapy vector by using Anc80 and to prevent undesired immune responses to the vector and transgene that can occur with the first dose of gene therapy by using our ImmTOR technology. Our initial area of focus is on genetic metabolic diseases, but may also include lysosomal storage diseases and genetic muscular diseases. We believe we are the first company to systematically pursue the development of gene therapy product candidates with the goal of enabling repeat administration. We have engaged third parties with experience in gene therapy and rare diseases to support the development of our proprietary products. We also have licensed our ImmTOR technology to Spark Therapeutics for the development of gene therapies for certain pre-specified targets. For more information, see "Licenses and Collaborations - Spark Therapeutics". 


• | Other products and product candidates affected by undesired immune responses. We have generated preclinical data which we believe suggests a broad potential benefit of ImmTOR for immune tolerance. For many biologic drugs, undesired immune responses limit efficacy and cause safety concerns. This includes TNF-alpha-specific monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and coagulation factor replacement therapies for the treatment of hemophilia. We intend to out-license ImmTOR technology for use with other products that are outside our focus to larger biopharmaceutical companies. We believe our ImmTOR technology may also be of interest to biopharmaceutical companies with novel biologic development concepts or product candidates in clinical development that have demonstrated initial efficacy but are experiencing issues with safety or sustained efficacy due to inhibitory ADAs. 

SEL-212 for the treatment of chronic refractory gout 
Overview
SEL-212 is our proprietary product candidate under development for the treatment of chronic refractory gout. SEL-212 consists of ImmTOR co-administered with pegadricase, a pegylated uricase. We believe that our SEL-212 has the potential, if successfully developed and approved, to offer a uniquely effective treatment for patients with chronic refractory gout, while also providing evidence regarding the utility of our ImmTOR technology platform. Pegylated uricase, in the form of the approved drug Krystexxa, has demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce uric acid levels and dissolve the harmful uric acid crystals that are the manifestations of gout upon initial treatment in patients. However, we believe broad commercial adoption has not been achieved primarily due to undesired immune responses. Based on the data received from our preclinical and Phase 1/2 clinical studies, we believe that by leveraging our ImmTOR technology to mitigate the formation of ADAs following the dosing of our pegylated uricase, pegadricase, SEL-212, if successfully developed and approved, could enable the removal of uric acid crystals in a majority of patients.
The market for gout therapy
Gout is a painful and potentially disabling form of arthritis resulting from excess accumulation of uric acid and deposition of uric acid crystals in joints and soft tissues, including those of the kidney and heart, causing harmful inflammation. Gout is 
caused by an overproduction of uric acid, a natural byproduct of purine metabolism that is produced after consumption of food with high levels of purines such as seafood, meat, yeast and certain vegetables, and/or an inability of the kidneys to excrete adequate amounts of uric acid from the body. High concentrations of serum uric acid lead to formation of uric acid crystals in joints and tissues, causing pain, inflammation and joint damage, and increase the risk for other conditions, including cardiovascular, cardiometabolic, joint and kidney disease.
There are approximately 8.3 million and 10.0 million gout sufferers in the United States and the European Union, respectively. The first line of treatments for gout are Allopurinol and Febuxostat. Both drugs are Xanthine Oxidase inhibitors, oral drugs that reduce the synthesis of uric acid. Lesinurad and Probenecid are oral gout drugs that increase the rate of excretion of uric acid through the kidneys, and are used almost exclusively in combination with these first line treatments. While these oral treatments are designed to prevent the formation of uric acid deposits, they are not well suited to reduce existing uric acid deposits in joints and tissues.
Gout is a spectrum of disease that is typically diagnosed through the measurement of uric acid levels in the blood and/or the identification of uric acid crystals from a visible tophus. High concentrations of serum uric acid increase the risk of co-morbidities, including cardiovascular, cardiometabolic, joint and kidney disease. Patients who are unable to reduce their serum uric acids levels below 6 mg/dl with oral drugs are diagnosed with refractory gout. Patients who have uric acid deposits, or tophi, in soft tissues, joints, the urinary tract, the digestive tract or the heart and a persistently elevated uric acid level when left untreated are diagnosed with chronic tophaceous gout. Tophi are a source of inflammation and pain. Chronic refractory gout constitutes a subset of gout patients exhibiting chronic high serum uric acid levels and painful and damaging uric acid deposits. In total, we estimate that there are approximately 160,000 chronic refractory gout patients in the U.S. who are seen by rheumatologists.
Figure 4 below illustrates the association between gout and diseases of the heart, vascular system, metabolic process, kidney and joints.
Figure 4. Co-Morbidities Associated with Gout
Based on our preclinical studies, clinical data from our Phase 1b and ongoing Phase 2 trials and market research, we believe that SEL-212 may potentially address several key unmet needs in the treatment of chronic refractory gout: the durable control of serum uric acid levels, the elimination of painful and damaging uric acid deposits, reduction in incidence and severity of flares and once-monthly dosing.
Our product development strategy is designed to address these unmet medical needs while improving the dosing regimen to a once-monthly treatment. We expect to commence enrollment for our Phase 2 head-to-head (COMPARE) clinical study against Krystexxa, which is intended to evaluate the differences between Krystexxa and SEL-212 with respect to serum uric acid control, flare rates and dosing convenience, in the first quarter of 2019. The results of the head-to-head (COMPARE) clinical trial are expected to inform the design of our planned Phase 3 clinical trial of SEL-212, following which we plan to seek regulatory approval for the treatment of refractory gout based on an endpoint of reduction of serum uric acid levels below 6 mg/dl. We intend for the Phase 3 protocol to include patients with chronic tophaceous gout. During our market research, physicians expressed their preference for a product that could be dosed monthly for at least six months. If approved, we plan to position 
SEL-212 as a debulking therapy for gout that has the potential to remove harmful uric acid deposits over a limited number of once-monthly doses and subsequently allow patients to switch to oral gout maintenance therapy unless and until such patients experience a subsequent manifestation of uric acid deposits. We do not believe that oral therapy would completely prevent the build-up over time of uric acid crystals in patients with a history of chronic tophaceous gout and, as a result, we anticipate that treatment with SEL-212, if approved, would be required intermittently in such patients. We believe that SEL-212, if approved, may be effective in removing harmful uric acid deposits in most patients with chronic tophaceous gout over multiple courses of treatment in their lifetimes. Figure 5 below depicts this positioning strategy as a sample diagram illustrating what we believe to be a shift in the treatment paradigm for chronic refractory gout.
Figure 5. Sample Treatment Course for Chronic Refractory Gout.
We expect our clinical and marketing strategy for SEL-212 to initially focus on the estimated 160,000 patients in the United States with chronic refractory gout who are being treated by rheumatologists. If SEL-212 is approved, we expect our strategy for marketing SEL-212 to rheumatologists will be to promote a switch from oral therapies to SEL-212 for patients with serum uric acid levels chronically above 6 mg/dl or those diagnosed with chronic tophaceous gout. Some rheumatologists have begun to utilize imaging technologies recommended by the guideline writing associations for rheumatology, including the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism. In particular, dual energy computed tomography, or DECT, can visualize uric acid deposits in joints and tissues as depicted in Figure 6 below in green. DECT has the potential to become an important tool to manage chronic refractory gout. Figure 6 below depicts a patient, using DECT imaging, with heavy urate burden at onset of study and almost a complete resolution of this after five months. We believe DECT imaging use could increase the market for SEL-212 by better assessing the severity of gout prior to treatment and by demonstrating the impact of efficacy following treatment.
Figure 6. Tophi / Uric Acid Deposits (shown in green) Visualized Using Dual Energy Computed Tomography Imaging
SEL-212 components
Our SEL-212 consists of ImmTOR co-administered with pegadricase. Our ImmTOR consists of nanoparticles composed of poly(D,L-lactide), or PLA, and poly(D,L-lactide)-block-poly(ethylene-glycol), or PLA-PEG, encapsulating rapamycin. Our pegadricase consists of a uricase modified with poly(ethylene-glycol), or PEG. The components of SEL-212 are depicted in Figure 7 below.
Figure 7. Components of SEL-212
Our pegadricase is a pegylated version of the therapeutic enzyme uricase, which we have licensed from Shenyang Sunshine Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or 3SBio, exclusively for all markets, except Japan and Greater China, and exclusively for Japan only in combination with our ImmTOR technology. Uricase is an enzyme endogenous to all mammals, except for humans and certain primates, which converts uric acid to the more soluble metabolite, allantoin. There is a natural limit to the amount of uric acid that can be excreted by the kidneys, which decreases with age and can be reduced by some medications. By converting uric acid to allantoin, uricase provides an additional way for the body to reduce uric acid. 
ImmTOR is our biodegradable nanoparticle that encapsulates rapamycin, also referred to as sirolimus. Rapamycin is the active ingredient of Rapamune, an immunosuppressant which has extensive prior use in humans and is currently FDA-approved as a prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients aged 13 or older. PLA is part of the broader poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), or PLGA, family of biodegradable polymers that have more than 30 years of commercial use and are formulation components in a number of approved products. Polyethylene glycol, or PEG, has been widely studied in clinical trials and is also a formulation component in many approved biologic products. In our preclinical studies, ImmTOR co-administered at the initiation of treatment with a biologic drug substantially reduced the formation of associated ADAs and induced antigen-specific immune tolerance to the biologic drug.
Clinical development
For chronic refractory gout, we are executing a clinical development program that seeks to evaluate SEL-212’s ability to durably reduce serum uric acid levels below 6.0 mg/dL. The saturation point of uric acid, or the maximum level at which uric acid will remain soluble in plasma, is 6.8 mg/dL. When uric acid rises above 6.8 mg/dL, monosodium urate microcrystals begin to form and settle in joints and other tissues, creating an inflammatory response that is diagnosed as gout. This inflammatory response is the source of highly debilitating gout flares experienced by patients. When serum uric acid levels drop below the level of 6.0 mg/dL, microcrystals will begin to dissolve and, over time, gout symptoms will resolve. Therefore, a serum uric acid level of less than 6.0 mg/dL is defined as the target for uric acid-lowering treatments by organizations such as the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism. The FDA and EMA have also considered the maintenance of serum uric acid levels below 6 mg/dL to be an acceptable primary endpoint in clinical trials for urate lowering therapies. Available oral gout therapies are designed to prevent the formation of uric acid microcrystals but are not effective in rapidly removing existing crystalized deposits. In severe gout patients who have significant deposits of monosodium urate crystals, known as tophi, it is of clinical benefit to significantly reduce serum uric acid levels (i.e. below 0.1 mg/dL) for a period of time in order to rapidly dissolve the monosodium urate crystals.
We expect to conduct multiple clinical studies in more than 400 patients with gout or elevated levels of serum uric acid. We initiated our clinical program in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2015 with a multicenter Phase 1a trial of pegadricase in patients with serum uric acid levels greater than 6.0 mg/dL. We completed the patient treatment portion of our Phase 1a trial in November 2015, initiated a Phase 1b trial in December 2015 and reported data from both Phase 1 clinical trials in December 2016. In our Phase 1b trial, we demonstrated that a single dose of SEL-212 was capable of lowering serum uric acid levels below 0.1 mg/dL for at least 30 days, which is correlated with the inhibition of uricase-specific ADAs. We initiated patient recruitment in an open label multi-dose Phase 2 clinical trial of SEL-212 in patients with symptomatic gout and elevated uric acid levels in October 2016. This study is being conducted at multiple clinical sites in the U.S. We have completed our initial end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and believe we have established a path forward for potential BLA submission. This program may consist of either a head-to-head active comparator study(s) or studies similar to the Krystexxa Phase 3 program, which would involve a comparison of SEL-212 to placebo.
Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials
SEL-212 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical program that includes a Phase 1a and Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with high uric acid levels as well as a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with symptomatic gout and high uric acid levels. Each Phase 1 clinical trial was designed with the primary objective to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEL-212 and its individual components. Additional objectives of the Phase 1 clinical trials included identifying a pegadricase dose that was capable of lowering serum uric acid levels over a period of one month, evaluating the immunogenicity of pegadricase after a single dose and demonstrating that ImmTOR co-administered with pegadricase reduced uric acid levels and mitigated the formation of uricase-specific ADAs. The Phase 2 clinical trial evaluated the effect of multiple doses over an extended period of time on serum uric acid and the formation of ADAs in patients. We received final data from both Phase 1 clinical trials in December 2016. We commenced patient recruitment in the Phase 2 clinical trial in October 2016. We plan to commence enrollment for our Phase 2 head-to-head (COMPARE) clinical trial of SEL-212, utilizing revised stopping rules, compared to Krystexxa in the first quarter of 2019 and expect to present interim 6-month data planned in the fourth quarter of 2019, and statistical superiority endpoints in the first quarter of 2020. The two-armed, open label trial is projected to enroll between 120-150 patients per arm, with one arm receiving Krystexxa (per label) vs. 6 monthly doses of SEL-212. The primary endpoint in the study is the percentage of patients in each arm that maintain sUA control below 6 mg/dL at the six month endpoint. The results of the head-to-head (COMPARE) clinical trial are expected to inform the design of our planned Phase 3 clinical trials of SEL-212, which we plan to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Phase 1a clinical trial
The Phase 1a clinical trial for SEL-212 was conducted at multiple sites in the United States and was a single ascending dose trial of pegadricase alone in 22 patients with elevated serum uric acid levels greater than 6 mg/dl. At the outset of the trial, each of five cohorts received a single intravenous infusion of pegadricase at ascending dose levels. We monitored the patients during a 30-day period post-infusion. We commenced enrollment of the clinical trial in the second quarter of 2015 and completed the 
treatment portion of the trial in November 2015. We observed that pegadricase showed no serious adverse events, or SAEs, and was well tolerated at the five dose levels tested. Additionally, we observed that pegadricase rapidly reduced and sustained average serum uric acid levels below 6 mg/dl for each cohort for 14 to 30 days, depending on the dose level. Consistent with our preclinical studies in animals, pegadricase induced uricase-specific ADAs in all patients with varying levels in this Phase 1a trial.
Figure 8 below indicates the serum uric acid and uricase-specific ADA levels for each patient in Cohort #3 of the Phase 1a clinical trial, which received a single dose of 0.4 mg/kg of pegadricase. The serum uric acid levels were measured at baseline and days seven, 14, 21 and 30 and uricase-specific ADA levels at baseline and days seven, 14 and 30 following the single intravenous injection of pegadricase. We did not measure uricase-specific ADA levels at day 21 in the Phase 1a clinical trial. Patient number two in this cohort developed a relatively low level uricase-specific ADA titer of 40 and maintained uric acid levels below 0.5 mg/dL through the thirtieth day after dosing. By contrast, the remaining four patients in the cohort developed levels of uricase-specific ADAs greater than 1,000 titer and uric acid levels above 5 mg/dL by the thirtieth day after dosing. Based on the results from our Phase 1a clinical trial, we observed that pegadricase at the 0.4 mg/kg dose is capable of achieving and maintaining a reduction of serum uric acid below the target of 6 mg/dL for a 30-day period in the absence of inhibitory uricase-specific ADAs.
Figure 8. Phase 1a Clinical Trial: Serum Uric Acid and Uricase-Specific ADA Levels of the Third Cohort
Based on our analysis of the Phase 1a clinical trial data, we selected the pegadricase dose of 0.4 mg/kg from Cohort #3 of the Phase 1a clinical trial for further study in the Phase 1b clinical trial.
Phase 1b clinical trial
In December 2015, we initiated our Phase 1b clinical trial at multiple sites in the United States. The clinical trial enrolled 63 patients with serum uric acid levels greater than 6 mg/dl. One group of five patients received a single 0.4 mg/kg dose of pegadricase alone, which we refer to as the Pegadricase Cohort. Four groups of patients, each containing two placebo-control patients and five test article patients, received a placebo or a single intravenous infusion of ImmTOR alone at the following ascending dose levels: 0.03 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg, which we refer to collectively as the ImmTOR Cohorts. Four groups of patients received a single intravenous infusion of ImmTOR at ascending dose levels of 0.03 mg/kg (5 patients), 0.1 mg/kg (10 patients), 0.15 mg/kg (5 patients) or 0.3 mg/kg (5 patients) with a fixed dose of pegadricase of 0.4 mg/kg, which we collectively call the SEL-212 cohorts. All patients were followed for at least 30 days after their initial dose.
Figure 9 below depicts the serum uric acid levels of the Pegadricase Cohort (depicted in red symbols), the ImmTOR Cohorts (depicted in blue symbols), and the SEL‑212 Cohorts (depicted in green symbols) from the Phase 1b clinical trial. Serum uric acid levels were measured at baseline and days seven, 14, 21, 30 and longer for some patients that maintained serum uric acid control at day 21. As expected, ImmTOR alone had no relevant effect on reducing serum uric acid levels across the ImmTOR Cohorts, as such levels remained relatively constant during the 30‑day period. Patients in the Pegadricase Cohort showed an immediate drop in uric acid levels after dosing, with uric acid levels returning close to or above baseline levels by day 21 in four of the five patients, similar to what was observed in Cohort #3 in the Phase 1A study. In contrast, patients in the SEL-212 Cohort receiving the lowest dose of ImmTOR (0.03 mg/kg) co-administered with pegadricase (0.4 mg/kg), showed four out of five patients maintaining serum uric acid levels below 6 mg/dL through day 21 after dosing. SEL-212 patients receiving ImmTOR at 0.1 mg/kg co-administered with 0.4 mg/kg of pegadricase, showed seven out of 10 patients maintained levels of serum uric acid of less than 0.1 mg/dl through day 30. SEL-212 patients receiving ImmTOR at 0.15 mg/kg co-administered with 0.4 mg/kg of pegadricase, showed all five patients maintaining levels of serum uric acid of less than 6 mg/dL through day 30. Finally, SEL-212 patients receiving ImmTOR at 0.3 mg/kg c- administered with 0.4 mg/kg of pegadricase, showed all five 
patients maintaining levels of serum uric acid of less than 0.1 mg/dL through day 30. These results indicate that SEL-212 showed a dose-dependent reduction in serum uric acid levels.
Figure 9. Phase 1b Clinical Trial: Uric Acid Levels Across All Phase 1b Cohorts
Figure 10 below depicts the serum uric acid levels at day 30 next to the corresponding day 30 uricase-specific ADA titer for all patients in the Pegadricase Cohort and in the SEL-212 Cohorts at the three higher dose levels. Four of the five patients treated with 0.4 mg/kg pegadricase alone showed their serum uric return to baseline by day 30 and all five showed uricase specific ADA titers greater than 1000. Seven of 10 SEL-212 patients treated with 0.1 mg/kg ImmTOR and 0.4 mg/kg pegadricase showed serum uric acid levels below 0.1 mg/dL with corresponding low or negative uricase specific ADA titers at day 30. All five SEL-212 patients treated with 0.15 mg/kg ImmTOR and 0.4 mg/kg pegadricase showed serum uric acid below 6 mg/dL at day 30. One patient developed uricase specific ADA titers greater than 1000 but still maintained his serum uric acid below the target threshold of 6 mg/dL at day 30. The other four patients showed no ADA titers and had serum uric acid levels below 0.1 mg/dL. Finally, all five SEL-212 patients treated with 0.3 mg/kg ImmTOR and 0.4 mg/kg pegadricase showed serum uric acid below 0.1 mg/dL at day 30 with corresponding low or negative ADA titers. The one patient with an ADA titer of 120 at baseline showed the same titer at baseline and at each time point tested, indicating that this patient had pre-existing low titer of antibody that was cross-reactive with pegadricase at baseline. These results indicate that SEL-212 mitigated the formation of uricase-specific ADAs which correlated with sustained control of serum uric acid levels through at least day 30 after a single dose.
Figure 10. Comparison of Phase 1b Uric Acid and Uricase‑Specific ADA Levels
Certain patients in the SEL-212 Cohort were requested to return for additional visits on days 37, 44, and/or 51 because their serum uric acid levels were still under control (<6 mg/dL) at day 21. Not all patients were able to return for the additional visits. The data for those who could return are in included in Figure 11 below. The data show that uric acid levels eventually returned to baseline, as expected after a single dose of pegadricase. Importantly, no emergence of ADAs was detected in those patients who exhibited low or no ADA titers at day 30. These data suggest that the treatment with ImmTOR controlled immune responses to pegadricase for up to 51 days after dosing. The data also support monthly dosing in the Phase 2 multiple dose trial of SEL-212.
Figure 11. Comparison of Phase 1b Uric Acid and Uricase‑Specific ADA Levels
At the completion of our Phase 1b program for SEL-212 we had dosed a total of 64 patients in the trial with either SEL-212 (ImmTOR and pegadricase), ImmTOR alone, pegadricase alone or placebo. The median serum acid level of patients enrolled was 7.3 mg/dL, with a mean of 7.4 mg/dL at baseline. Patients presented with an average of 5.3 co-morbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes.
We have generally observed that SEL‑212 and its components, ImmTOR and pegadricase, have been well tolerated in this patient population. There were a total of six SAEs in the Phase 1b trial. Of the six SAEs, three were determined to not to be related to study drug by investigators. Of the remaining three SAEs that were determined to possibly or likely be related to 
study drug, two were cases of stomatitis that occurred at the highest dose of ImmTOR tested (0.5 mg/kg), leading us to define 0.3 mg/kg as the maximum tolerated dose of ImmTOR in this patient population. The remaining SAE was a case of drug hypersensitivity that occurred at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg of ImmTOR in combination with 0.4 mg/kg of pegadricase. In all cases, the patient fully-recovered from the SAE without residual effects.
Phase 2 clinical trial
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we began enrolling patients with symptomatic gout and elevated serum uric acid levels in an open-label, multiple ascending dose Phase 2 clinical trial of SEL-212. The primary and secondary endpoints for this trial include safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and reduction of serum uric acid and ADA levels. We are also collecting data regarding flares and other patient-related observations. We are enrolling patients in multiple ascending dose cohorts with the primary goal of identifying the dose regimens to advance into our planned Phase 3 clinical program.
As of December 17, 2018, a total of 152 patients had been dosed in the Phase 2 trial at 15 active U.S. clinical sites and the treatment phase of all SEL-212 cohorts had been completed. The following is a summary of clinical activity from the trial as defined by the primary clinical endpoint (i.e., serum uric acid levels below 6 mg/dL):

• | Control and 0.05 mg/kg ImmTOR Dose Cohorts (cohorts receiving five monthly doses of pegadricase alone or three monthly doses of 0.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg of pegadricase + 0.05 mg/kg of ImmTOR followed by two monthly doses of pegadricase alone): Dosing of patients in the control cohorts receiving pegadricase alone was stopped early due to a loss of clinical activity caused by the immunogenicity of the enzyme. Clinical activity was lost by week 12 in the majority of patients receiving pegadricase in combination with the 0.05 mg/kg dose of ImmTOR .


• | 0.08 and 0.1 mg/kg ImmTOR Dose Cohorts (cohorts receiving three monthly doses of 0.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg of pegadricase + 0.08 or 0.10 mg/kg of ImmTOR followed by two monthly doses of pegadricase alone): A majority of patients in these cohorts maintained clinical activity while receiving the combination therapy through week 12. These results are consistent with the level of clinical activity observed through day 30 at a similar SEL-212 dose level in our Phase 1b trial. At the 0.1 mg/kg dose level, half of the patients that maintained clinical activity through week 12 also maintained clinical activity through week 20.


• | 0.125 and 0.15 mg/kg ImmTOR Dose Cohorts (cohorts receiving three monthly doses of pegadricase +0.125 or 0.15 mg/kg of ImmTOR followed by two monthly doses of pegadricase alone): A majority of patients in these cohorts maintained clinical activity while receiving the combination therapy through week 12. These results are consistent with the level of clinical activity observed through day 30 at a similar SEL-212 dose level in our Phase 1b trial. Approximately 81% of evaluable patients (N=27) receiving up to 0.15 mg/kg ImmTOR in combination with 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg of pegadricase followed by 2 monthly doses of pegadricase alone had serum uric acid control below 6 mg/dL at week 12. 


• | 0.10 and 0.15 mg/kg ImmTOR 5 Combination Dose Cohorts (cohorts receiving five monthly doses of pegadricase +0.10 or 0.15 mg/kg of ImmTOR ): Five monthly doses of SEL-212 resulted in sustained serum uric acid control and has been well tolerated over the entire treatment period. 100% of the patients that had serum uric acid levels below 6 mg/dL at 12 weeks maintained control through 20 weeks. Approximately 66% of evaluable patients (21/32) completed week 20 with serum uric acid levels below 6 mg/dL. (Figure 12). 

Figure 12. Five Combination Doses Controlled Serum Uric Acid <6 mg/dL at Week 20 in 66% of Patients
Data from the ongoing trial suggest that ADA levels have been strongly correlated with serum uric acid levels. We have observed that ImmTOR has reduced the formation of ADAs in a dose-dependent manner, which we believe enables pegadricase to maintain its clinical activity for extended durations as compared to pegadricase administered without ImmTOR.
Data from the ongoing trial suggest that sustained control of serum uric acid near 0 mg/dL may lead to reduction in uric acid deposits as measured by DECT imaging.
As of December 17, 2018, approximately 29% of patients receiving SEL-212 reported a gout flare during their first month of the trial. This is followed by a decline in flare rates during the remainder of the therapy (Figure 13). By comparison, 50% of patients reported a flare during the first month in the control cohorts receiving pegadricase alone before treatment was stopped due to loss of efficacy and safety.
Figure 13. Percentage of Patients Reporting a Gout Flare per Month
SEL-212 has been generally well tolerated at clinically active doses following repeated administrations in the trial. As of December 17, 2018, 20 patients reported a total of 23 SAEs in the Phase 2 clinical trial. Nine SAEs had been reported in the five dose combination cohorts, seven of which were reported to be not related or unlikely related to study drug, and two of which were infusion reactions. All SAEs were successfully treated without further issues.
Our ImmTOR programs for immune tolerance in gene therapy
Overview
Although gene therapy has made significant progress over the last several years, it faces certain limitations due to undesired immunogenicity to either the AAV vector or the encoded transgene.
For those patients who are able to receive a dose of gene therapy, gene vector-specific ADAs frequently occur and have been found to prevent the AAV vector from reaching its target cell. It is unknown exactly how long these neutralizing ADAs prevent redosing of gene therapy. However, it has been observed in studies with animals and humans that high titer AAV-specific ADAs develop and persist for more than 10 years, preventing vector readministration. In addition, cellular immune responses have been found to correlate with liver inflammation and loss of gene expression.
Because of the induction of lasting antibodies against AAV, we believe many gene therapy companies have focused on the single localized dose in diseases of the eye and central nervous system for which immunogenicity is perceived to be less of an issue. We believe that many gene therapy applications may require or would benefit from multiple doses, especially therapies designed to treat diseases via intravenous administration. Some of these rare genetic deficiencies are best treated when patients are infants or small children in order to prevent developmental defects. However, pediatric patients may have a higher need for repeat dosing due to higher cell turnover as the patient grows. Accordingly, we believe that a solution enabling repeat dosing would significantly expand the number of diseases and patients that could be treated with gene therapies.
Genethon Collaboration
In collaboration with Genethon, a not-for-profit company focusing on gene therapies, we have generated and presented preclinical data in mice in which we observed that ImmTOR mitigated the formation of ADAs to AAV-based gene therapy, thereby enabling repeat dosing of the AAV vector in these mice. Preclinical data generated in connection with this collaboration 
also show that ImmTOR mitigated the formation of ADAs to AAV capsids in nonhuman primates. We believe these results further indicate that ImmTOR may have the potential to mitigate undesired immune responses and enable repeat intravenous administration of gene therapies.
SEL-302 for the Treatment of Methylmalonic Acidemia
In 2016, we in-licensed Anc80, a gene therapy vector, from MEE. In preclinical studies, Anc80 has been observed to be a potent gene therapy vector.
By combining ImmTOR and Anc80, we intend to enable the development of highly differentiated gene therapies with the goal of improving gene therapy safety by mitigating cellular immune responses, and allowing for repeat gene therapy dosing.
In collaboration with the clinical and gene therapy laboratories at the NIH and MEE, we are developing SEL-302, a product candidate utilizing the Anc80 vector in combination with ImmTOR for the treatment of methylmalonic acidemia, or MMA, which can cause severe developmental defects and premature death as a result of an accumulation of toxic metabolites. Other than dietary and cofactor therapy, organ transplantation is the only existing option for patients with MMA, a severe organic acidemia most frequently caused by mutations in the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, or MUT.
SEL-313 for the Treatment of OTC Deficiency
For our second gene therapy program, we plan to develop another product candidate for the treatment of OTC deficiency, which is another metabolic disorder. We are pursuing this second indication through collaborations with third parties with preclinical and clinical experience in this area.
Factor VIII 
On December 2, 2016, or the Spark Signing Date, we entered into a License and Option Agreement, or the Spark License Agreement, with Spark Therapeutics, Inc., or Spark, to collaborate on the development of gene therapies for certain targets utilizing our ImmTOR technology. Under the terms of the Spark License Agreement, we granted Spark certain exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing licenses to our intellectual property and know-how relating to our ImmTOR technology to research, develop and commercialize gene therapies for Factor VIII, an essential blood clotting protein relevant to the treatment of hemophilia A, which is the initial target under the collaboration.
Pursuant to the Spark License Agreement, Spark has made aggregate payments of $15.0 million to date. On a target-by-target basis, we will be eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $430.0 million in milestone payments for each target, with up to $65.0 million being based on Spark’s achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones and up to $365.0 million for commercial milestones, as well as tiered royalties on global net sales at percentages ranging from mid-single to low-double digits. Until December 2019, Spark has the right to fund up to 50.0% of any development or regulatory milestone payable to us by issuing us shares of Spark’s common stock having a fair market value equal to the percentage of such development or regulatory milestone, as applicable.
In addition, for a period of three years from the Spark Signing Date, Spark may exercise options to research, develop and commercialize gene therapies utilizing the ImmTOR technology for up to four additional pre-specified targets, subject to Spark’s payment of the applicable option exercise fee, in a range of $1.4 million to $2.0 million depending on the incidence of the applicable indication, to us in each case.
In connection with the Spark License Agreement, we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Spark, or the Spark SPA, pursuant to which Spark purchased an aggregate of $15.0 million of our common stock including (i) 197,238 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5.0 million on the Spark Signing Date, (ii) 324,362 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5.0 million on June 8, 2017, and (iii) 205,254 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5.0 million on October 31, 2017.
For more information about the Spark License Agreement and the Spark SPA, see the discussion under “Licenses and Collaborations” below.
Crigler Najjar Syndrome 
In September 2018 we also announced a collaboration with CureCN, a European non-profit developing an AAV gene therapy for the treatment of Crigler Najjar Syndrome, an ultra-rare disease of iron metabolism mediated by a single gene deletion of a liver enzyme. The consortium plans to utilize our ImmTOR technology in combination with their AAV gene therapy with the potential to re-dose patients who are not producing enough enzyme post their first dose of AAV gene therapy. Preclinical toxicology studies are expected to begin in the first half of 2019, with the potential for initiation of preclinical combination studies in the second half of 2019.
MANUFACTURING
We manufacture ImmTOR using a readily-scalable, self-assembly nanoemulsion process with well-defined, robust commercial pharmaceutical unit operations. This proprietary, highly specialized and precisely controlled manufacturing process enables us to reproducibly manufacture ImmTOR across many production scales, from milligram-scale at the laboratory bench to hundreds of grams to multi-kilogram scale for commercial production. This well-defined process has been produced at multiple scales. We have also developed and executed the required detailed analytic characterization of our products.
For the SEL-212 program, we have increased ImmTOR production to a 50-gram scale and have developed an approximately 400-gram scale process, which, at the current projected clinical dose, we believe would be suitable for commercial launch. The process is designed such that this same equipment is capable of potentially producing up to a one kilogram batch size scale. As our nanoparticle manufacturing process is compact, and therefore also portable, our strategy is to transfer our custom designed process skids to our contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, and have the CMO produce the nanoparticles, under our direction. This is the strategy we use for production of clinical supplies for clinical trials and would be the expected strategy for commercial production.
The pegadricase enzyme for SEL-212 is produced by fermentation in E. Coli and is sourced from 3SBio in China. 3SBio is a Chinese pharmaceutical company that produces multiple approved products in China and also has product sales in other countries around the world. 3SBio supplies the pegadricase used in the current clinical trials of SEL-212 in the United States. Through a licensing arrangement, we own exclusive worldwide rights to pegadricase outside of China, with co-ownership of rights in Japan and with 3SBio owning all rights in China. Under this arrangement, 3SBio has agreed to supply us with pegadricase. We also have selected a back-up supplier for pegadricase in the United States.
In January 2017 we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Lonza Houston, Inc., a leader in viral gene and cell therapy manufacturing. Under the terms of the agreement, Lonza has agreed to produce an Anc80-AAV-based gene therapy product for our proprietary program for MMA.

We are required to make future payments to 3SBio contingent upon the occurrence of events related to the achievement of clinical and regulatory approval milestones of up to an aggregate of $21.0 million for products containing our ImmTOR technology, and up to an aggregate of $41.5 million for products without our ImmTOR technology. We are also required to pay 3SBio tiered royalties on annual worldwide net sales related to the pegadricase component of products at percentages ranging from the low-to-mid single digits for products containing our ImmTOR technology, and from the mid-single digits to low or low-to-mid teens for products without our ImmTOR technology, subject to specified reductions. These royalties are payable, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of (i) the date that all of the patent rights for that product have expired in that country, or (ii) a specified number of years from the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
The 3SBio License expires on the date of expiration of all of our royalty payment obligations unless earlier terminated by either party for an uncured material default or for the other party’s bankruptcy. We may also terminate the 3SBio License on a country-by-country or product-by-product basis for any reason effective upon 60 days’ prior written notice to 3SBio or, with respect to a given product, immediately upon written notice to 3SBio if we identify a safety or efficacy concern related to such product.
BIND
In December 2008, we entered into a cross-license agreement with BIND Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly BIND Biosciences, Inc.), or BIND, which we refer to as the BIND Agreement. Pursuant to the BIND Agreement, BIND granted us a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free worldwide non-exclusive license under certain of BIND’s existing and future patent rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import products and services covered by such patents and patent applications in the field of certain prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. The time period for adding new patent rights, not included in the families of previously licensed patent rights, to our license grant from BIND has expired. Pursuant to the BIND Agreement, we granted BIND a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide non-exclusive license under certain of our current and future patent rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import products and services covered by such patents and patent applications in all other fields, in each case, excluding certain future patent rights of each party related to novel targeting agents. The time period for adding new patent rights, not included in the families of previously licensed patent rights, to BIND’s license grant from us has expired.
We have paid BIND an upfront license issuance fee and reimbursed certain of BIND’s fees in connection with the entry into the BIND Agreement. No royalties or other payments are due to or by either party. The BIND Agreement expires upon expiration of the last patent right covered by the BIND Agreement. Neither party may unilaterally terminate the BIND Agreement for any reason. If either party materially breaches the BIND Agreement, fails to expend a specified amount in research and development activities related to the BIND Agreement, undergoes bankruptcy or insolvency, or undergoes a change of control, the future patent rights to be included in the license grant to the party breaching, failing to expend such amounts or undergoing such event under the BIND Agreement will no longer be granted to the breaching party.
In connection with BIND’s entry into bankruptcy proceeding in 2016, Pfizer purchased substantially all of the assets of BIND, including those pertaining to the BIND Agreement.
Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary
In May 2016, we entered into a license agreement with the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and The Schepens Eye Research Institute, Inc., or, collectively, MEE, which we refer to as the MEE License. Under the MEE License, we were granted an exclusive commercial worldwide license, with the right to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers, to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import certain products and to practice certain processes, the sale, use or practice of which are covered by patents and proprietary know-how owned or controlled by MEE, for use of Anc80 gene therapy vectors for gene augmentation therapies expressing certain target sequences.
MEE also granted us exclusive options to exclusively license certain of their intellectual property rights relating to several additional target sequences and variations thereof each linked to a specified disease. Pursuant to the MEE Agreement, we agreed to pay MEE a license fee in the low six figures, annual license maintenance fees ranging from the mid-twenty thousands to mid-seventy thousands and an option maintenance fee in the low five figures for each exercisable option. We also agreed to pay development milestones on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, totaling up to an aggregate of between $4.2 million to $37.0 million and sales milestones on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, totaling up to an aggregate of between $50.0 million to $70.0 million; tiered royalties equal to a percentage of net sales ranging from mid-single digits to mid-teens, subject to certain reductions; and a percentage, in a range expected to be in the mid-teens depending on timing, of any sublicense income we receive from sublicensing our rights granted thereunder, subject to certain reductions and exclusions. The MEE License will continue until the expiration of the last to expire of the patent rights licensed thereunder. We may terminate the MEE License in whole or in part upon prior written notice. MEE may terminate the MEE License on a target sequence-by-target sequence basis if we fail to make any scheduled payments in respect of such target sequence or if we materially breach a diligence obligation in respect of such target sequence, in each case if we fail to cure within a specified time period. MEE may terminate the MEE License in its entirety if we materially breach certain of our obligations related to diligence, representations and warranties, and maintenance of insurance; if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any patents licensed thereunder; if any of our executive officers are convicted of a felony relating to manufacture, use, sale or importation of licensed products; or upon our insolvency or bankruptcy.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We endeavor to protect our SVP based immunotherapy program technology, which we consider fundamental to our business, by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, relating to our program, product candidates, their methods of use and the processes for their manufacture. Our practice is to strive to protect our intellectual property by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, programs and product candidates that are commercially important to the operation and growth of our business. We also rely on trade secrets 
and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, programs and product candidates, continuing innovation and in-licensing opportunities to maintain, advance and fortify our proprietary position in our SVP-based immunotherapy program and product candidates. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our program technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned or controlled by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
We have developed and in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to our SVP-based immunotherapy technology, program and product candidates. Our patent portfolio contains 10 issued patents in the United States and 82 foreign issued patents, in all cases, owned solely by us. We also have 62 pending patent applications in the United States as well as 407 foreign pending patent applications, in all cases, owned solely by us. These patents and patent applications include claims directed to:

• | tolerance and cancer immunotherapy programs;


• | other immune stimulation programs;


• | methods and compositions incorporating our proprietary SVP nanoparticle in a variety of tolerance applications, including:


• | mitigating or treating anti-drug antibodies association with protein drugs such as pegadricase or LMB-100, and


• | genetic therapies (such as viral delivery of genes).


• | development and commercialization of SEL-212, including both composition of matter and method of treatment claims (there are three patent families that cover the SEL-212 product, one of which is a licensed, issued U.S. patent that covers the SEL-212 product, which expires in 2021); and


• | methods and compositions incorporating our proprietary SVP nanoparticle in a variety of cancer immunotherapy applications, including:


• | creating various cancer vaccines, and


• | combination treatments, including co-treatment with PD-1/PDL-1 checkpoint inhibitors.

Set forth below is a table indicating the expiration dates for our owned patent families, or expected expiration dates in the case of our owned patent application families, corresponding to each of our programs.

In addition, we have exclusively or non-exclusively licensed intellectual property, including the following patent portfolio: 36 U.S. issued patents; 235 foreign issued patents; 7 U.S. pending patent applications; and 74 foreign pending applications. The licensed patents and patent applications cover various aspects of the technology being developed by us, including claims directed to compositions of matter and methods of use, and have been filed in various countries worldwide including in North America, Europe and Asia, with material expiration dates varying from 2021 to, if claims are issued, 2028. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we often file analogous patent applications in the European Union and in additional foreign countries where we believe such filing is likely to be beneficial, including but not limited to Australia, Brazil, China, and Eurasia, including the Russian Federation, Europe, South Korea, Mexico, India, Israel and Japan.
Each patent’s term depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. The patent term in most countries in which we file is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. Notably, the term of U.S. patents may be extended due to delays incurred due to compliance with FDA or by delays encountered during prosecution that 
are caused by the USPTO. For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, depending upon the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. There is a limit to the amount of time a patent may be extended in the United States; no patent extension can extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar patent term extensions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions for patents that cover regulatory-approved drugs. Currently, we own or license patents with material expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2032. If patents are issued on pending patent applications that we own or license, the resulting patents are expected to have material expiration dates ranging from 2027 to 2035. However, the actual patent protection period varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
COMPETITION
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of SEL-212, and any other tolerance or immune stimulation product candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic or biosimilar products. SEL-212 may compete with others in the gout market, including Krystexxa, which contains a pegylated uricase similar to the pegadricase component of SEL-212 and is indicated for the treatment of refractory gout. Horizon Pharma plc, whose affiliates own Krystexxa, may find other approaches to eliminate undesired immunogenicity to Krystexxa. Long-term treatment with global immunosuppressive products may increase the susceptibility to contract infections, tumors and may lead to organ failure. Large companies with active research to prevent the formation of ADAs and treat allergies or autoimmune diseases include Sanofi, Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, and Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck. Small, early-stage biopharmaceutical companies active in the research for new technologies to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance include Anokion SA, AnTolRx Inc., Apitope International NV, Caladrius Biosciences, Cour Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc., Dendright International, Inc., Parvus Therapeutics, REGiMMUNE Corporation, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc., Tolerion, Inc., Topas Therapeutics GmbH, and Txcell SA. However, we believe that most of these companies are focused on autoimmune and inflammatory diseases rather than immune tolerance to biologics.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.
Our most advanced product candidate, SEL-212, is subject to regulation in the United States as a combination product. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and would require approval of independent marketing applications by the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a Center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our SEL-212, we believe that the primary mode of action is attributable to the biologic component of the product. In the case of SEL-212, which we believe will 
be regulated as a therapeutic biologic, the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, will have primary jurisdiction over premarket development. We expect to seek approval of SEL-212 through a single Biologics License Application, or BLA, reviewed by CDER, and we do not expect that the FDA will require a separate marketing authorization for each constituent of SEL-212.
Biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. SEL-212 and any other product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries.
U.S. biological products development process
The process required by the FDA before a biologic, including a gene therapy, may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive nonclinical testing, sometimes referred to as preclinical testing, including laboratory tests, animal trials and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for humane use of laboratory animals;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended use;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.

Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules had historically been subject to review by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, of the National institutes of Health, or NIH, Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. On August 17, 2018, the NIH issued a notice in the Federal Register and issued a public statement proposing changes to the oversight framework for gene therapy trials, including changes to the applicable NIH Guidelines to modify the roles and responsibilities of the RAC with respect to human clinical trials of gene therapy products, and requesting public comment on its proposed modifications. During the public comment period, which closed on October 16, 2018, the NIH announced that it would no longer accept new human gene transfer protocols for review as a part of the protocol registration process or convene the RAC to review individual clinical protocols. These trials remain subject to the FDA’s oversight and other clinical trial regulations, and oversight at the local level will continue as set forth in the NIH Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk 
to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, patient selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor patient safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase I. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human patients and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.


• | Phase II. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.


• | Phase III. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements.
U.S. review and approval processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal trials, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days after an c 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product candidate. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the applicant interprets the same data. If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months from the filing date and 90% of priority BLAs in six months from the filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs.
Orphan designation
The FDA may grant orphan designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
In the United States, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
We have not requested orphan designation for our product candidates, but depending on the proposed indication for which we intend to develop our future products, we may in the future request such designation.
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic may request that the FDA designate the biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product subject to accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
In addition, under the provisions of FDASIA, the FDA established a Breakthrough Therapy Designation which is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of Fast Track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and FDA will either grant or deny the request.
Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if we receive one of these designations for our product candidates, the FDA may later decide that our product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification. In addition, these designations may not provide us with a material commercial advantage.
Post-approval requirements
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects and reporting updated safety and efficacy information.
We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as 
possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Biosimilars and exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product.
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for certain biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a study.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Government regulation outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial authorization, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA.
There are two types of MAs.

• | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, , advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), and medicinal products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210 days review period is reduced to 150 days.


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, which is similar to the U.S. BLA. The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no marketing authorization application shall be accepted and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if the:

• | second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;


• | applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or


• | applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
We are also subject to data privacy and security laws in the jurisdictions outside of the U.S. in which we are established, run clinical trials or in which we sell or market our products once approved. For example, in Europe we are subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR) in relation to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identifiable living individual). We process personal data in relation to participants in our clinical trials in the EEA., including the health and medical information of these participants. The GDPR is directly applicable in each E.U. Member State, however, it provides that E.U. Member States may introduce further conditions, including limitations which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data (including health and medical information), or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and implement policies as part of its mandated privacy governance framework. It also requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of personal data; defines for the first time pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data; introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements; and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are also subject to E.U. rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the E.U. and EEA. We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those E.U. jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to the GDPR. Fines for certain breaches of the GDPR are significant: up to the greater of EUR 20 million or 4% of total global annual turnover. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/ change our use of data, enforcement notices, as well potential civil claims including class action type litigation where individuals suffer harm.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Other healthcare laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products, other U.S. federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may also constitute a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. 
government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of pricing information and marketing expenditure as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to, as well as imposed certain other privacy obligations on, “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Coverage and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate 
reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations.
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
The containment of healthcare costs is a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceutical or biological products have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
Healthcare reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, the ACA, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; and created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.
We also expect that the current presidential administration and U.S. Congress will continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. Recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the law.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies.
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
