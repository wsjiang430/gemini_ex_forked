Item 1. Business.
OVERVIEW
 

We are a multinational company with operations primarily in the telecommunications and payment industries. We have two reportable business segments, Telecom & Payment Services and net2phone (formerly net2phone-Unified Communications as a Service, or UCaaS).

OUR STRATEGY
 

Since our founding, we have focused on value creation by leveraging potentially disruptive telecommunications, payment and other technologies to challenge entrenched business models. Outside of our core businesses, we seek to select and incubate promising early stage businesses.
 

Since 2008, five non-core businesses have spun-off to our stockholders: CTM Media (now IDW Media Holdings) (2009), Genie Energy (2011), Straight Path Communications (2013), Zedge (2016) and Rafael Holdings (2018). Additionally, we have sold other assets to realize value for our shareholders including net2phone (subsequently repurchased), IDT Entertainment, Corbina and Fabrix.
 

Our current revenue and income from operations are generated predominantly by our three core offerings:
 

● | BOSS Revolution Calling;
--+-------------------------


● | Carrier Services; and
--+----------------------


● | Mobile Top-Up.
--+---------------

 
We believe that these businesses are synergistic and jointly leverage certain of our strategic assets including:
 

● | The BOSS Revolution and IDT brands;
--+------------------------------------


● | A nationwide network of more than 42,000 BOSS Revolution retailers; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our retail customer base of more than eight million, primarily in immigrant communities within the United States; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our technology, global infrastructure and transaction platforms; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extensive VoIP and cloud services expertise; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Our staff of more than 1,200 working in over 20 offices on five continents. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our core services compete primarily in the mature pay-per-minute international voice communications market. Several long-term, industry-wide trends have, for several years, been gradually reducing the size of the global market for these services including the growing popularity of low-cost or free messaging services and other non-voice communications technologies, free peer-to-peer voice calls available when both parties utilize broadband connections, and the prevalence of flat-rate international long distance plans offered both by the largest mobile network operators and niche mobile virtual network operators. We believe that these trends have pressured revenue and margin generated by our core offerings.

To counter the sectoral challenges in the pay-per-minute market, we are pursuing a multi-pronged strategy:
 

● | Investing to scale a portfolio of what we believe to be high-margin, rapidly growing businesses that leverage our core strategic assets to provide synergistic communications and payments services, including: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | net2phone, a provider of cloud communication services for businesses globally; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | National Retail Solutions, or NRS, an operator of a POS platform serving independent retailers; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | BOSS Revolution Money Transfer, a provider of international remittances through both retail and direct-to-consumer channels. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversification and enhancement of offerings in our core market including: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | BOSS Revolution Calling: Launching new and competitive offerings such as unlimited, flat-rate calling plans; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | BOSS Revolution Mobile, a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, providing wireless communication services; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mobile Top-Up: Developing bundles of voice, data and messaging for recharging accounts internationally in addition to voice-only air-time top-up; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Carrier Services: Offering incumbent national telecoms value-added services including outsourced management of international long-distance traffic and launch of a self-service platform, IDT Express, for wholesale termination of international long-distance calls and purchase of direct inward dialing numbers, or DIDs; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | BOSS Revolution Calling and BOSS Revolution Money apps: both of which have strengthened our relationships with our retail customers, improved the economics of our offerings, and increased opportunities to cross-market our services. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
3

 


● | Reducing the underlying cost of providing our services by: 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilizing new technologies; and 
--+------------------------------------


● | Reducing our selling, general and administrative costs. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that this strategy has begun to offset the impact of the secular trends in the pay-per-minute market and to stabilize our gross profit despite continued declines in our core revenue.
 
BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
 
Telecom & Payment Services
 
Our Telecom & Payment Services, or TPS, segment, represented 96.6% and 97.7% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. TPS offerings are classified in two verticals, Core and Growth, as follows:

● | Core includes our three largest communications and payments offerings by revenue: 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | BOSS Revolution Calling
--+------------------------


● | Carrier Services; and
--+----------------------


● | Mobile Top-Up.
--+---------------

 
Core also includes smaller communications and payments offerings.
 

● | Growth includes high-margin, rapidly growing businesses that leverage our core strategic assets to provide synergistic communications and payments services, including: 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | NRS;
--+-----


● | BOSS Revolution Money Transfer; and 
--+----------------------------------------


● | BOSS Revolution Mobile.
--+------------------------

 


During fiscal 2019, our TPS segment generated $1,361.9 million in revenues and income from operations of $14.3 million, as compared with revenues of $1,511.5 million in revenues and income from operations of $25.8 million in fiscal 2018.
 

Telecom & Payment Services – Core
 

BOSS Revolution Calling
 

BOSS Revolution Calling’s revenue was $490.7 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $529.7 million in fiscal 2018 (36.0% and 35.0% of TPS’ revenue in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively).
 

Our BOSS Revolution Calling business is a prepaid international long-distance calling service marketed primarily to foreign-born and underbanked consumers in the United States, with smaller retail operations serving customers in Europe, Asia, South America and Canada.
 

BOSS Revolution Calling offerings include our flagship ‘BOSS Revolution’ branded international long-distance prepaid calling service as well as disposable hard cards sold under a variety of brands. In the United States, BOSS Revolution Calling serves, as of July 31, 2019, approximately 3.7 million customers per month, of which approximately 1.3 million use the BOSS Revolution Calling app (for iOS and Android).
 

Usage of our BOSS Revolution Calling App has been growing rapidly. Nevertheless, the majority of our customers purchase BOSS Revolution Calling offerings through our nationwide network of approximately 42,000 BOSS Revolution resellers. These resellers are typically independent retailers serving foreign-born communities including significant unbanked or under-banked populations. BOSS Revolution Calling allows users to place international long-distance calls at affordable rates from the BOSS Revolution Calling app or by calling an access number. Regardless of how the call originates, our customers must first establish and top-up a prepaid BOSS Revolution account that is linked to their phone. Once the account is established and a call is placed, our platform recognizes the customer’s phone through its network-provided automatic number identification and seamlessly links each call to the corresponding BOSS Revolution account. Callers then enter their destination phone numbers. BOSS Revolution Calling customers’ account balances are debited at a fixed rate per minute or at a fixed amount for unlimited calling to a specific country over a specified time period, typically one month. In contrast to many competitors, BOSS Revolution Calling does not charge connection, usage or breakage fees. BOSS Revolution Calling’s per minute rates can vary by the destination country, city, and whether the call is placed to a landline or mobile phone. Rates are published on the BOSS Revolution consumer website and within the BOSS Revolution Calling app.

Customers with a credit card, debit card or store-bought top-up voucher can open and add to their account balance directly through the BOSS Revolution Calling or BOSS Revolution Money apps, by phone, or through the BOSS Revolution consumer website (www.bossrevolution.com).
 

Alternatively, customers can also open and top-up their account balance at any BOSS Revolution retailer using cash, a debit card or a credit card. Our nationwide reseller network enables our customers, many of whom we believe are unbanked, to purchase our offerings with cash.
 

In the United States, we distribute our retail products primarily through our network of distributors that, either directly or through sub-distributors, sell to retail locations. In addition, our internal sales force sells BOSS Revolution Calling and other platform products directly to retailers. Distributors, our internal salespeople and retailers receive commissions based on the revenue generated by each transaction or fee per transaction, depending on the product.
 

The BOSS Revolution retailer portal can be accessed on the world wide web via a networked computer or by Android and iOS smartphones. The BOSS Revolution retailer portal enables retailers to create accounts for new customers, add funds to existing customer balances and execute sales transactions. It provides a direct, real-time interface with our retailers, resulting in a cost-effective and adaptable distribution model that allows us to target and promote services directly to distributors and retailers, to introduce and cross-sell new offerings, and to rapidly respond to changes in the business environment.
 

In the United States, the BOSS Revolution brand is supported by national, regional and local marketing programs that include television and radio advertising, online advertising, print media, and grass roots marketing at community and sporting events. In addition, we work closely with distributors and retailers on in-store promotional programs and events.
 

BOSS Revolution Calling’s sales have traditionally been strongest in the Northeastern United States and in Florida because of our extensive local distribution network and their large foreign-born populations. We continue to grow distributor relationships and expand our retail network in other areas of the United States, including the Southwest and West Coast, where we historically have not had as strong of a market presence.
 

Carrier Services
 

Carrier Services’ revenue was $514.2 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $639.0 million in fiscal 2018, contributing 37.8% and 42.3% of TPS’ revenue in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
 

Our Carrier Services business is one of the largest wholesale carriers of international long-distance minutes in the world.
 

Carrier Services’ telecommunications network is comprised of interconnections and commercial relationships that reach virtually every significant carrier globally. These relationships enable us to carry international telecommunications traffic to more than 190 countries around the world. The division’s customers include our BOSS Revolution Calling business, net2phone, major and niche carriers around the globe, mobile network operators, and other service providers such as call aggregators. For many of these customers, particularly the major carriers, we engage in buy-sell relationships, terminating their customers’ traffic in exchange for terminating our wholesale and retail traffic with them.



We offer competitively priced international termination rates at several quality levels. We can offer competitively priced termination services in part because of the large volumes of originating minutes generated by our BOSS Revolution Calling business, our global platform powered by proprietary software, our team of professional and experienced account managers and market makers, and the global network of interconnects and relationships with other telecom system operators around the globe.
 

TPS terminated 22.4 billion minutes in fiscal 2019, as compared to 25.5 billion minutes in fiscal 2018. Carrier Services accounted for 17.5 billion minutes and 19.7 billion minutes of the total TPS’ minutes in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
 
Carrier Services has a significant number of direct connections to Tier 1 providers in North America, Latin America, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Tier 1 providers are the largest recognized licensed carriers in a country. Direct connections improve the quality of the telephone calls and reduce the cost, thereby enabling us to generate more traffic with higher margins to the associated foreign locales. We also have direct relationships with mobile network operators, reflecting their growing share of the voice traffic market.

Termination rates charged by Tier 1 and other providers of international long-distance traffic have been declining for many years. Nevertheless, termination rates charged to us by individual Tier 1 carriers and mobile operators can be volatile. Termination price volatility on heavily trafficked routes can significantly impact our minutes of use and wholesale revenues.
 

In addition to offering competitive rates to our carrier customers, we emphasize our ability to offer the high-quality connections that these providers often require. To that end, we offer higher-priced services in which we provide higher-quality connections, based upon a set of predetermined quality of service criteria. These services meet a growing need for higher-quality connections for some of our customers who provide services to high-value, quality-conscious retail customers. As of July 31, 2019, Carrier Services had more than 2,000 customers and has more than 340 carrier relationships globally.
 

Carrier Services’ revenue is generated by sales to both postpaid and prepaid customers. Postpaid customers typically include Tier 1 carriers, mobile network operators and our most credit worthy customers. Prepaid customers are typically smaller telecommunication companies as well as independent call aggregators.
 

Carrier Services also provide outsourcing services to help fixed and mobile telephony operators enhance the profitability and value of their international voice operations. Carrier Services offers these operators customized solutions including full outsourcing, handing all inbound and outbound calls with or without switch management, and hybrid arrangements whereby the operator retains certain routes or customers directly. Pursuant to these deals, Carrier Services collaborates with the companies to provide a full range of international long-distance services to their respective customers in-country and overseas.
 

Mobile Top-Up
 

Mobile Top-Up’s revenue was $272.0 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $253.6 million in fiscal 2018 (20.0% and 16.8% of TPS’ revenue in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively).
 

Our Mobile Top-Up offerings enable customers to transfer airtime and bundles of airtime, messaging and data to recharge or ‘top-up’ mobile phone accounts internationally (International Mobile Top-Up, or IMTU) and domestically (Domestic Mobile Top-Up, or DMTU). Mobile Top-Up’s offerings leverage our platform capabilities, our distribution reach into foreign-born communities and our relationships with mobile operators around the world.
 

IMTU and DMTU offerings are sold under the BOSS Revolution brand through the BOSS Revolution digital platforms, including our BOSS Revolution Calling and BOSS Revolution Money apps, as well as through mobile operator branded top-up cards sold by our retail network. We offer Mobile Top-Up service for approximately 150 different carriers in 90 countries. Most Mobile Top-Up revenue is generated by the sale of IMTU offerings.
 

Telecom & Payment Services – Growth
 

National Retail Solutions (NRS)
 
Our NRS business operates a point-of-sale, or POS, network that processes sales and provides business management tools and other services to independent retailers in the United States. We believe that these services help independent retailers increase sales and operate more efficiently and profitably, equipping them to compete more effectively against large retail chains. 
 
The POS terminals integrate hardware – including cash registers, barcode scanners, retailer and customer-facing hi-definition screens, receipt printers and credit card readers – with NRS’ proprietary software that includes features such as inventory management, sales tracking, and price book management.
 

The primary market for NRS POS terminals is the more than 200,000 independently owned convenience, liquor, grocery and tobacco stores in the United States.
 
6

 

At September 30, 2019, NRS had deployed more than 10,000 POS terminals with bodegas and other retailers nationwide of which approximately 8,000 actively processed transactions during the month. NRS is currently selling an additional 900 to 1,000 new terminals to its network per quarter. NRS sales and marketing is targeted, in part, to our nationwide network of BOSS Revolution retailers. It has also secured partnerships with more than 100 wholesale distributors including some of the largest cash-and-carry wholesalers in the United States.
 
NRS currently generates the majority of its revenue from retailers through the sale of POS terminals and a monthly recurring fee for use of the POS software and customer support. In addition, NRS charges retailers for certain premium POS services including payment processing services and monthly subscriptions for premium POS features.
 
In addition, NRS leverages the nationwide scale of its POS network to generate revenues from (1) the sale of data analytics and (2) out-of-home display advertising delivered through the terminals’ consumer-facing screens.
 
Data Analytics: NRS captures targeted, daily POS data from independent retailers at scale. These retailers are concentrated in urban communities with significant immigrant populations and, in the aggregate, constitute a significant but largely opaque market. NRS’ network tracks more than 35 million monthly transactions in this sector that otherwise would be unavailable for analysis. NRS has built a data platform that allows third parties to analyze trends at independent retailers and gain insights into this segment of the retail economy.
Display Advertising: The 15” high-definition customer-facing screens on the NRS terminals are designed to engage customers during check-out. The screen enables retailers to offer coupon deals and promotions on in-store products, and enables NRS to provide digital-out-of-home advertisers a display for both static and video advertisements.
 
We believe that the NRS business is synergistic with our other communications and payment services including BOSS Revolution Calling, BOSS Revolution Money Transfer and Mobile Top-Up, all of which can be sold and provisioned by retailers directly from their NRS terminals.
 

BOSS Revolution Money Transfer
 

We believe that international money remittance is a significant economic activity among our target market of foreign-born communities. Our BOSS Revolution Money Transfer business enables customers in the United States to remit money to approximately 50 countries. The service is offered through licensed BOSS Revolution authorized money transfer agents as well as through the BOSS Revolution direct-to-consumer channel via the Boss Revolution Money app and website.
 

Our money transfer service leverages the BOSS Revolution retail network to afford unbanked and underbanked customers the ability to initiate transactions with cash. In order to provide our remittance service, BOSS Revolution retailers must meet certain financial and other qualifications. To date, only a fraction of the BOSS Revolution retail network has been approved to offer money transfer services. Our internal sales force is recruiting new money transfer retailers to expand our origination network, and we continue to enhance our retail money transfer portal to facilitate adoption and utilization of the money transfer offering by BOSS Revolution retailers.
 

BOSS Revolution Money Transfer offers its service directly to consumers through our BOSS Revolution Money app and the BOSS Revolution website. Direct-to-consumer is the fastest growing channel, led by significant increases in transaction volumes through corridors in Africa as well as Latin America. During fiscal 2019, approximately two thirds of our transactions originated over our digital platform – primarily the BOSS Revolution Money app. The BOSS Revolution Money app works seamlessly with the BOSS Revolution Calling app to enable customers with a debit or credit card to send money transfers and mobile top-up easily and securely directly from their iOS or Android device.
 

BOSS Revolution Money Transfer’s payment network includes payout locations in 49 countries and over 300,000 locations. In addition, remittances are offered to mobile wallets in some destinations.
 

BOSS Revolution Money Transfer generates revenues from a per-transaction fee charged to the customer and from foreign exchange differentials. Transaction costs include commissions paid to the retail agent, payment to the international disbursing agent, banking, compliance, foreign currency exchange costs and, in the case of direct-to-consumer transfers, credit and debit card processing fees.
 

Boss Revolution Mobile
 

We launched Boss Revolution Mobile in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Boss Revolution Mobile is a domestic mobile service operating on Sprint’s nationwide network offering an innovative, low-cost model for mobile service under our Boss Revolution brand.

International Operations
 

Internationally, we are a provider of prepaid calling cards including both private label and IDT-branded calling cards, which are sold through an extensive network of thousands of independent retailers as well as through our own internal sales force. Additionally, we sell BOSS Revolution Calling, IMTU and payment services in select global markets both through retailers and direct to consumers. Carrier Services’ products and services are marketed and sold globally through our internal Carrier Services account management team.
 

In Europe, we market our prepaid calling products in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Austria and Luxembourg, seeking to capitalize on the demographic opportunity presented by immigration from outside of Europe to these developed nations. Because the immigrant market is fragmented, and due to the large number of markets in which we compete, we offer over 600 different prepaid calling cards in Europe. In addition, we sell BOSS Revolution platform products through retailers, our mobile calling app, and direct-to-consumer web sites in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom.
 

Our operations in Europe also include Carrier Services. We maintain our European corporate, prepaid calling and Carrier Services operations in London, England. We also operate satellite offices in Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland and Greece.
 

Our European operations, including Carrier Services and BOSS Revolution Calling, generated $405.4 million of revenues in fiscal 2019, a 5.3% decline from the $428.1 million of revenues generated during fiscal 2018. Our European operations’ revenues constituted 29.8% of TPS’ revenues in fiscal 2019, as compared to 28.3% in fiscal 2018.
 

In Asia, we sell BOSS Revolution Calling direct to consumers online and through our app in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore and post-paid calling services direct to consumers and small businesses in Hong Kong. In fiscal 2019, we generated $47.7 million in revenues from our operations in the Asia-Pacific region compared to $55.5 million in fiscal 2018, primarily through our Carrier Services business. We maintain our Asia Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong.
 

In Latin America, we market prepaid calling products in Argentina and Brazil. We maintain our Latin American headquarters in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In fiscal 2019, we generated $0.7 million in revenues from the sale of prepaid calling in Latin America compared to $1.5 million in fiscal 2018.
 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 

In the United States, we distribute our TPS retail products, including prepaid calling, IMTU and DMTU, money transfer and bill payment services to retail outlets. Our retail products are provisioned directly through the BOSS Revolution retailer portal or through our network of distributors and our internal sales force. In addition, our private label calling cards as well as our IDT-branded calling cards are also marketed to retail chains and outlets through our internal sales force, and from time to time, we may utilize third-party agents or brokers to acquire accounts.
 

We also market all of our most significant retail offerings, including BOSS Revolution Calling, IMTU and DMTU, and BOSS Revolution Money Transfer, directly to the consumer via online channels including the BOSS Revolution consumer website (www.bossrevolution.com) and mobile apps for iOS and Android.
 

In Europe and Latin America, we are a provider of prepaid calling cards including both private label and IDT-branded calling cards, which are sold through a network of independent retailers as well as through our own internal sales force. Additionally, we sell BOSS Revolution Calling and IMTU in select markets both through retailers and directly to consumers. In Asia, we sell BOSS Revolution Calling direct to consumers online and through our BOSS Revolution Calling app and postpaid services direct to consumers and small businesses. Carrier Services are marketed and sold through our internal account management team. In Canada, we sell BOSS Revolution platform products through retailers, our mobile calling app and direct-to-consumer web sites.
 

Telecommunications Network Infrastructure
 

We operate a global network to provide an array of telecommunications and payment services to our customers worldwide using a combination of proprietary and third-party applications. Proprietary applications include call routing and rating, customer provisioning, call management, e-commerce sites, product web pages, calling card features, and payment services features. Proprietary applications provide the flexibility to adapt to evolving marketplace demands without third-party software releases, and often provide advantages in capability or cost over third-party solutions.
 

Our core voice network utilizes VoIP and is interconnected, where needed, through gateways to time-division multiplexing, or TDM, networks worldwide. This hybrid IP/TDM capability allows us to interface with carriers using the lowest cost technology protocol available. To support our global reach, we operate voice switches and/or points of presence in the United States, Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. We receive and terminate voice traffic from every country in the world, including cellular, landline and satellite calls through direct and indirect interconnects. The network includes data centers located in the United States, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, which house equipment used for both our voice and payment services, with smaller points of presence in several other countries. Our global network is monitored and operated on a continual basis by our Network Operations Center in the United States. We also make use of one of the leading cloud providers to serve as host for some of our application infrastructure.

net2phone’s revenue was $47.3 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $34.9 million in fiscal 2018. net2phone’s loss from operations was $6.5 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $2.7 million in fiscal 2018.
 
net2phone’s revenue is generated by several offerings including:
 

● | cloud-based unified communications services offered primarily to small and mid-sized business customers; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Session Initiation Protocol, or SIP trunking, which supports inbound and outbound domestic and international calling from an IP PBX; and

net2phone launched its Unified Communications as a Service, or UCaaS, offering in 2015, leveraging IDT’s deep expertise in VoIP communications, established technology team, and global telephony network. net2phone’s UCaaS offering has become its primary growth engine and strategic focus.
 
The net2phone UCaaS solution converges communications across devices: desk phone, PC and mobile devices via the net2phone app, all backed by client management tools and analytics. net2phone’s cloud-based platform replaces and improves upon on-premise private branch exchanges, or PBXs, which many businesses maintain to operate their legacy phone systems. net2phone’s advanced feature set includes its mobile app, Web RTC, SMS/MMS, live chat widget, voicemail to email transcription, and client analytics. net2phone adds features and enhancements to its offering on a regular basis. In 2019, net2phone began deployment of its proprietary platform to enhance system reliability and facilitate the development and deployment of additional features and third-party integrations.
 
At its 2015 launch, net2phone’s UCaaS service was offered only in the United States. In 2016, net2phone began its international expansion, offering cloud communications to businesses in Brazil. net2phone expanded to Argentina in May 2017, Colombia in May 2018 and Mexico in August 2018. In September 2018, net2phone entered the Canadian market through its acquisition of Versature Corp., a Software as a Service, or SaaS, business communications solutions and hosted VoIP provider serving the Canadian market.
 
We expect that net2phone will continue to grow rapidly by focusing on expansion in its overseas markets. These markets are large and characterized by low rates of UCaaS penetration, high levels of competitive fragmentation and, in many cases, by a lack of significant attention from the global market leaders. Future growth catalysts include the continued roll-out of net2phone’s proprietary platform, development and deployment of new features and functionality, expansion into additional geographic markets, further customization for local markets, and, outside of Canada, the development of a direct-to-consumer channel.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
net2phone is focused on the agent channel marketplace and acquires a substantial majority of its customers through its network of master agents, telecom agents and managed service providers in the United States and internationally. Versature historically utilized a direct-to-consumer channel model to acquire customers across Canada. In October 2019, Versature announced a channel market program, leveraging net2phone’s channel relationships and experience.
 
net2phone’s cloud-communications offering is priced on a per-seat basis, with each employee identity constituting a seat. Pricing is structured on a monthly base fee per seat, with additional option-based charges including provisioning of pre-configured VoIP phones.

Competition
 
Telecom & Payment Services
 
BOSS Revolution Calling
 
Like all international calling services, our BOSS Revolution Calling service is subject to fierce competition, and we do not expect to grow revenues and/or margins without a successful strategy and sound execution. While virtually any company offering communication services is a competitor, we face particularly strong competition from Tier 1 mobile network operators who offer flat-rate international calling plans, other PIN-less prepaid voice offerings, prepaid calling card providers, mobile virtual network operators, and VoIP and other “over the top”, or OTT, service providers. Outside the United States, we also compete with large foreign state-owned or state sanctioned telephone companies.
 
Many of these companies, such as AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint, are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical, engineering, personnel and marketing resources, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and larger customer bases than we do. The use by these competitors of their resources in or affecting the international prepaid calling market could significantly impact our ability to compete against them successfully.
 
In addition to these larger competitors, we face significant competition from smaller prepaid calling providers, who from time-to-time offer rates that are substantially below our rates, and in some instances below what we believe to be the cost to provide the service, to gain market share. This type of pricing by one or more competitors can adversely affect our revenues, as they gain market share at our expense, and our gross margins, if we lower rates to better compete.
 
The continued growth of OTT calling and messaging services such as Skype, Viber, and WhatsApp has adversely affected the sales of BOSS Revolution and our other prepaid calling services. We expect the popularity of these IP-based services—many of which offer voice communications for free provided both the caller and recipient have a broadband connection—to continue to increase, which may result in increased substitution and pricing pressure on our BOSS Revolution and other international prepaid calling service offerings.
 
Many wireless operators offer unlimited international long-distance plans that include international destinations to which customers can place direct calls from their mobile phones without time limitation. These plans now include some of our most popular international destinations. The growth of these “international unlimited” plans adversely affects our revenues as these operators gain subscriber market share.
 
In our view, our ability to compete successfully against these operators depends on several factors. Our interconnect and termination agreements, network infrastructure and least-cost-routing system enable us to offer low-cost, high quality services. Our extensive distribution and retail networks provide us with a strong presence in communities of foreign-born residents, a significant portion of which purchase our services with cash. Our BOSS Revolution brand is often highly visible in these communities and has a reputation for quality service and competitive, transparent pricing. Finally, we also offer synergistic payment services over the BOSS Revolution platform that customers can conveniently access from their accounts. In our view, these factors represent competitive advantages.
 
However, some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition and can provide comparable service levels and pricing through established brands. Consequently, our ability to maintain and/or to capture additional market share will remain dependent upon our ability to continue to provide competitively priced services, expand our distribution and retail networks, improve our ability to reach and sell to customers through mobile devices, develop successful new products and services to fit the evolving needs of our customers, and continue to build the brand equity of BOSS Revolution.
 
Carrier Services
 
The wholesale carrier industry has numerous entities competing for the same customers, primarily based on price and quality of service.
 
In our Carrier Services business, we participate in a global marketplace with:
 

● | interexchange carriers and other long-distance resellers and providers, including large carriers such as T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | historically state-owned or state-sanctioned telephone companies such as Telefonica, France Telecom and KDDI; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | on-line, spot-market trading exchanges for voice minutes; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | OTT internet telephony providers; 
--+--------------------------------------

● | other VoIP providers;
--+----------------------


● | other providers of international long-distance services; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | alliances between large multinational carriers that provide wholesale carrier services. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that our Carrier Services business derives a competitive advantage from several inter-related factors:
 

● | our BOSS Revolution Calling business generates large volumes of originating minutes, which represents a desirable, negotiable asset that helps us win return traffic and obtain beneficial pricing which we can offer in the wholesale arena; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the proprietary technologies powering our wholesale platform and, in particular, the software that drives voice over internet protocols enables us to scale up at a lower cost than many of our competitors; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our professional and experienced account management; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | our extensive network of interconnects around the globe, with the ability to connect in whichever format (IP or TDM) is most feasible. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In aggregate, we believe that these factors provide us with a competitive advantage over some participants on certain routes.
 
Mobile Top-Up
 
The major competitors to Mobile Top-Up’s offerings include:
 

● | international mobile operators, who seek to control more of their own distribution channel or create their own products that directly compete with our international airtime top-up; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other distributors, who develop a more comprehensive product offering than our international airtime top-up offerings or aggressively discount their product offerings that are like our international airtime top-up offerings. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BOSS Revolution Money Transfer


BOSS Revolution Money Transfer competes against traditional international money transfer services with established retail and disbursement networks including Western Union, MoneyGram and Ria, as well as many niche money transfer organizations that serve specific destination corridors. Our direct-to-consumer channel competes with these operators as well as with new entrants including Xoom, TransferWise and World-Remit that seek to disrupt the retailer-based money transfer market.
National Retail Solutions (NRS)
 
NRS competes against several nationwide POS companies that primarily service other retail store segments, but also service NRS’ target market of independent convenience, liquor and tobacco stores in the United States. These companies include, among others, Square, Clover and NCR. NRS believes that it has a competitive advantage because other nationwide POS companies do not offer the complete suite of services that NRS has tailored to the specific needs of independent retailers. In addition, we do not believe that these competitors have NRS’ reach into the ethnic retailer market where many retailers have established relationships with us and sell our BOSS Revolution offerings.
 
NRS also competes with smaller, regional POS companies that focus on convenience stores. However, these regional players generally do not offer a comparable suite of POS services, have limited capacity to scale their platforms, and/or are not price competitive.
  
net2phone
 
Major competitors to our net2phone offerings include other UCaaS and hosted voice providers such as Vonage Business, Nextiva, 8x8, LogMeIn and Ring Central. Due to their longevity and substantial investments in the marketplace, these providers offer more widely recognized brands, larger and more developed marketing and sales forces and/or channel agent networks, and a more advanced product sets including features such as services designed specifically for call centers, video and chat. These competitors’ offerings typically also support integration of their services with other well-known, third-party customer relationship management, or CRM, vendors such as SalesForce and SugarCRM as well as with various Google applications.


REGULATION
 
The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation is intended to describe what we believe to be the most important, but not all, current and proposed international, federal, state and local laws, regulations, orders and legislation that are likely to materially affect us.
 
11

 

Regulation of Telecom in the United States
 
Telecommunications services are subject to extensive government regulation at both the federal and state levels in the United States. Any violations of the regulations may subject us to enforcement actions, including interest and penalties. The Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has jurisdiction over all telecommunications common carriers to the extent they provide interstate or international communications services, including the use of local networks to originate or terminate such services. Each state regulatory commission has jurisdiction over the same carriers with respect to their provision of local and intrastate communications services. Local governments often indirectly regulate aspects of our communications business by imposing zoning requirements, taxes, permit or right-of-way procedures or franchise fees. Significant changes to the applicable laws or regulations imposed by any of these regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
Regulation of Telecom by the Federal Communications Commission
 
Universal Service and Other Regulatory Fees and Charges
 
In 1997, the FCC issued an order, referred to as the Universal Service Order, that requires all telecommunications carriers providing interstate telecommunications services to contribute to universal service support programs administered by the FCC (known as the Universal Service Fund). In addition, beginning in October 2006, interconnected VoIP providers, such as our subsidiary net2phone, are required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. These periodic contributions are currently assessed based on a percentage of each contributor’s interstate and international end user telecommunications revenues reported to the FCC. We also contribute to several other regulatory funds and programs, most notably Telecommunications Relay Service, FCC Regulatory Fees, and Local Number Portability (collectively, the Other Funds). We and most of our competitors pass through Universal Service Fund and Other Funds contributions as part of the price of our services, either as part of the base rate or, to the extent allowed, as a separate surcharge on customer bills. Due to the manner in which these contributions are calculated, we cannot be assured that we fully recover from our customers all of our contributions. In addition, based on the nature of our current business, we receive certain exemptions from federal Universal Service Fund contributions. Changes in our business could eliminate our ability to qualify for some or all of these exemptions. As a result, our ability to pursue certain new business opportunities in the future may be constrained in order to maintain these exemptions, the elimination of which could materially affect the rates we would need to charge for existing services. Changes in regulation may also have an impact on the availability of some or all of these exemptions. If even some of these exemptions become unavailable, they could materially increase our federal Universal Service Fund or Other Funds’ contributions and have a material adverse effect on the cost of our operations and, therefore, on our ability to continue to operate profitably, and to develop and grow our business. We cannot be certain of the stability of the contribution factors for the Other Funds. Significant increases in the contribution factor for the Other Funds in general and the Telecommunications Relay Service Fund in particular can impact our profitability. Whether these contribution factors will be stable in the future is unknown, but it is possible that we will be subject to significant increases.
Regulation of Telecom by State Public Utility Commissions
 
Our telecommunications services that originate and terminate within the same state, including both local and in-state long distance services are subject to the jurisdiction of that state’s public utility commission. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, generally preempts state statutes and regulations that prevent the provision of competitive services but permits state public utility commissions to regulate the rates, terms and conditions of intrastate services, so long as such regulation is not inconsistent with the requirements of federal law. We are certified to provide facilities-based and/or resold long-distance service in all 50 states and facilities-based and resold local exchange service in 45 states. In addition to requiring certification, state regulatory authorities may impose tariff and filing requirements, consumer protection measures, and obligations to contribute to universal service and other funds. Rates for intrastate switched access services, which we both pay to local exchange companies and collect from long-distance companies for terminating in-state toll calls, are subject to the jurisdiction of the state commissions. State commissions also have jurisdiction to approve negotiated rates, or establish rates through arbitration, for interconnection, including rates for unbundled network elements. Changes in those access charges or rates for unbundled network elements could have a substantial and material impact on our business.
 
Regulation of Telecom—International
 
In connection with our international operations, we have obtained licenses or are otherwise authorized to provide telecommunications services in various foreign countries. We have obtained licenses or authorizations in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. In numerous countries where we operate or plan to operate, we are subject to many local laws and regulations that, among other things, may restrict or limit the ability of telecommunications companies to provide telecommunications services in competition with state-owned or state-sanctioned dominant carriers.
 
Regulation of Internet Telephony
 
The use of the Internet and private IP networks to provide voice communications services is generally less regulated than traditional switch-based telephony within the United States and abroad and, in many markets, is not subject to the imposition of certain taxes and fees that increase our costs. As a result, we are able, in many markets, to offer VoIP communications services at rates that are more attractive than those applicable to traditional telephone services. However, in the U.S. and abroad, there have been efforts by legislatures and regulators to harmonize the regulatory structures between traditional switch-based telephony and VoIP. This could result in additional fees, charges, taxes and regulations on IP communications services that could materially increase our costs and may limit or eliminate our competitive pricing advantages. Additionally, several foreign governments have adopted laws and/or regulations that could restrict or prohibit the provision of voice communications services over the Internet or private IP networks. These efforts could likewise harm our ability to offer VoIP communications services.

Money Transmitter and Payment Instrument Laws and Regulations
 
Our consumer payment services offerings include money transfer and various network branded, also called “open loop”, prepaid card offerings. These industries are heavily regulated. Accordingly, we, and the products and services that we market in consumer payment services, are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations, including:

● | Banking laws and regulations;
--+------------------------------


● | Money transmitter and payment instrument laws and regulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Anti-money laundering laws; 
--+--------------------------------


● | Privacy and data security laws and regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Consumer protection laws and regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------


● | Unclaimed property laws; and 
--+---------------------------------


● | Card association and network organization rules. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------



In connection with the development of our money transmission services and the expansion of our network branded prepaid card offerings, we have actively pursued our own money transmitter licenses. At July 31, 2019, we had received a money transmitter license in 48 of the 49 U.S. states that require such a license, as well as in Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.


Regulation of Other Businesses


We operate other smaller or early-stage initiatives and operations, which may be subject to federal, state, local or foreign law and regulation.


INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We own numerous patents, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad; in particular our registered trademarks and brands: IDT®, BOSS Revolution®, and Net2Phone®. From time to time we have also acquired or licensed intellectual property relating to present and future business strategy. We believe that our technological position significantly depends on the technical experience, expertise, and creative ability of our employees to maintain both our current businesses and pursue future business development. Our corporate policies require all employees to assign intellectual property rights developed in the scope of, or in relation to our business to us, and to protect all intellectual property and proprietary information and materials as confidential.  Our global telecommunications switching and transmission infrastructure enables us to provide an array of telecommunications, Internet access and Internet telephony services to our customers worldwide. We rely upon domestic and foreign patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property rights, regarding our infrastructure and global telecommunication network for our international telecommunications traffic and the international traffic of other telecommunications companies.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of October 1, 2019, we had a total of approximately 1,285 employees, of which approximately 1,270 were full-time employees.
