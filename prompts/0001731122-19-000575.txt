Item 1. Business
Our Business
 We are a pre-clinical stage biotechnology company committed to using our genetically modified cellular and immune-therapy technologies to prevent or potentially cure HIV and to potentially provide life-long cancer remission of some of the deadliest cancers. In the event our technologies are approved for use, we plan to do this by genetically modifying, or re-engineering, different types of cells, depending on the therapeutic area, and then injecting or reinfusing the re-engineered cells back into the patient to provide treatment. In some of our planned interventions, immunotherapy could be used.
 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS
 
HIV attacks the body’s own immune system, specifically killing off CD4+ cells, or T-cells. Left untreated, HIV reduces the number of T-cells in the body, leading to AIDs, a condition where the body cannot fight off common infections and disease.
 
Currently there are over 30 antiretroviral drugs, or ART, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to treat HIV patients but these drugs are expensive, require daily adherence and can have significant side effects over time. In addition, approximately 1 million people, including in high-income countries, continue to die from HIV/AIDS due to resistance to ART or lack of access. Today there are no treatments which can eliminate the reservoir of cells that contain HIV from the body. In other words, treatment is life-long.
 
There have been several efforts to cure HIV by re-engineering a person’s own T-cells so that such cells no longer express C-C chemokine receptor type 5, also known as CCR5, which is an essential co-receptor for HIV to enter T-cells. A mutation that blocks expression of CCR5 on T-cells occurs in a small percentage of people with no known adverse effects. The “Berlin patient”, and more recently the “London patient” are HIV- positive persons who developed cancer and were treated with a bone marrow transplant with cells derived from persons with a naturally occurring deletion of CCR5. The Berlin and London patients seems to be effectively cured from HIV providing a proof of concept that HIV can be cured. However, because the transplanted cells come from another person, such transplants are highly toxic and can result in death in a significant proportion of patients. Given the success with these two patients, several researchers and companies have attempted to replicate the experience of such patients by genetically modifying the T-cells of the HIV-positive patients themselves and reinfusing them with T-cells that do not express CCR5. Because the transplanted cells are from the same person, the risks to the patient are much lower. The uptake, or engraftment of the modified, reinfused cells, however, has not been optimal, leading to a failure to achieve a cure. In addition, the transplant conditioning that has been used is myeloablative chemotherapy, wiping out the patient’s immune system, which has inherent risks and can have long term side-effects including the risk of developing cancer.

ENOB-HV-01 is a novel, proprietary approach with the potential to overcome the failures of recent efforts. The intervention:
 1) provides gene-modified, reinfused cells with a competitive advantage over non-modified cells in the HIV-positive person, with the potential to significantly increase engraftment; and 2) avoids the need for myeloablative chemotherapy and, in fact, could potentially be given on an outpatient basis. Initial in vivo studies demonstrated that hypothesis. ENOB-HV-01 is now undergoing additional in vivo and in vitro studies intended to support an INTERACT meeting request with the US FDA in the early part of the 2020 calendar year.
 
We are also developing ENOB-HV-11 and ENOB-HV-12 that will utilize a novel cellular- and immunotherapy approach that could potentially provide for a preventative vaccine and a therapeutic vaccine, respectively. Initial in vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of the approach to promote a robust immune response. In vivo studies have been developed and are expected to begin in the early part of the 2020 calendar year.

Cancer
 
Based on learning from peer-reviewed publications of Phase I/IIa trials we have designed an innovative dendritic-cell based therapeutic vaccination platform that could potentially be used to induce life-long remissions from some of the deadliest solid tumors. We plan to initially target pancreatic cancer, triple negative breast cancer, glioblastoma, and renal cell carcinoma. The platform might also allow for non-specific immune enhancement that could have impact against a broad array of solid tumors. As with HIV, our approach could potentially allow for outpatient therapy without ablating or significantly impairing the patient’s immune system, as many current approaches require.
Our Product Candidates
 We are focused on the development of human therapeutics for infectious diseases and cancers. We are advancing a focused pipeline of innovative gene therapies that have been developed internally. We have proprietary preclinical and discovery stage programs in HIV/AIDS and cancer immunotherapy.
 
A summary table of our key development programs as of September 2019 is provided below:
 


ENOB-HV-01 Autologous Cell Therapy
 Our lead candidate, ENOB-HV-01 is being developed to improve on the hypothesis that an allogeneic bone marrow transplant procedure could represent a potential curative treatment for HIV. ENOB-HV-01 seeks instead to develop a method of bone marrow transplant using autologous (the patient’s own cells) CD34+ cells, which could have significant advantages over allogeneic bone marrow transplants. The prevailing hypothesis is that an autologous treatment could become available to most patients suffering from HIV/AIDS, and there is no need for matched donors and no risk of “Graft versus Host Disease” (when the immune system of the treated patient rejects and destroys the transplanted cells).
 ENOB-HV-01 as it is being developed seeks to silence the CCR5 gene in cells of a patient’s immune system to make these cells permanently resistant to HIV infection, by mimicking the naturally occurring CCR5 delta-32 mutation that renders a population of individuals largely resistant to infection by the most common strains of HIV. The aim of this approach is to provide the patient with a population of HIV-resistant CD4 cells that can fight HIV and opportunistic infections.
 Currently, we are conducting in vitro and in vivo proof-of-concept studies of ENOB-HV-01 through partnerships with The Scripps Institute, and other leading scientists and academic centers that we expect to lead to completion of the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (“CMC”) requirements for an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) filing.

ENOB- HV-11 (preventive) and ENOB-HV-12 (therapeutic) Vaccine
 ENOB-HV-11 and ENOB-HV-12 are being developed as a preventative vaccine and therapeutic vaccine, respectively. We are advancing the preventative vaccine and a therapeutic vaccine program through partnerships with TFred Hutchinson Cancer Center and other leading scientists and academic centers that we expect to lead to completion of the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (“CMC”) requirements for an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) filing.

ENOB-DB-01 MCV Vaccine Technology and ENOB-DC-01 Off-the-shelf DC Vaccine pulsed with MCV
 
ENOB-DB-01 was developed as a therapeutic cancer vaccine for long term maintenance and prevention of relapse for stage III and IV colon cancer patients. ENOB-DC-01 is being developed as an improvement on ENOB-DB-01 (formerly “MCV”), as a dendritic cell cancer vaccine designed to prevent relapse in colon cancer patients with no evidence of disease after resection and chemotherapy. We are currently in the discovery/research stage, and we believe a succession of strong clinical success in the field of checkpoint inhibitors has spawned a renewed interest in the development of cancer vaccines. We plan to use new clinical data to and existing data on ENOB-DB-01 to develop ENOB-DC-01.

ENOB-DC-11 Innovative DC Vaccine for Multiple Solid Tumors 
 ENOB-DC-11 is being developed as an off the shelf, universal, dendritic cell as a delivery system for more specifically tailored cancer treatments. In this approach, immature dendritic cells are differentiated from monocytes derived from bone marrow stem cells. During the production process, monocytes are genetically modified to elicit cellular, humoral and systemic immune response by activating the cytotoxic response pathway, reactive B cell response, which induces a pan-activated immune response against the “target” we are loading the dendritic cells with. The genetic modifications of these monocytes include a single chain proprietary/unique sequence that we have developed. The genetically modified monocytes then differentiate into immature dendritic cells that are pulsed with tumor lysate or neopeptides and matured with a proprietary cocktail that could be used as a therapeutic vaccine.
 
Initial in vitro studies show substantial increases in tumor-cell killing. We are currently in the pre-clinical phase of this product line.
 ENOB-DC-21 Non-specific vaccine for intratumoral injection
 
ENOB-DC-21 builds on insights gained from multiple avenues including the other cancer pipeline products discussed above. We are in the discovery/research phase of this product line.
 Collaborations
 We have established strategic partnerships with leading scientists and centers, such as The Scripps Institute and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, for several of our programs. We will continue to pursue partnerships when appropriate with selected philanthropic, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to fund internal research and development activities, and to assist in product development and commercialization. We are applying our technology platform to several commercial applications in which our products provide us and our strategic partners and collaborators with potential technical, competitive and economic advantages.

To date, our operations have been funded by sales of our securities. Sales revenue will not support our current operations and we expect this to be the case until our therapies or products are approved for marketing in the United States and Europe. Even if we are successful in having our therapies or products approve, we cannot guarantee that a market for our products will develop. We may never be profitable.
 
Our Intellectual Property
 
Patents and licenses are important to our business. Our strategy is to file or license patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that we consider important for the development of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as continuing technological innovations, proprietary knowledge, and various third party agreements, including, without limitation, confidentiality agreements, materials transfer agreements, research agreements and licensing agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and seek protection of those rights so that we can fully exploit our innovations.
 We also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Our patent filings are discussed briefly below.

 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the field of gene therapy, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. While we believe that our technology platforms, strong intellectual property portfolio and scientific expertise in the gene therapy field provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, new market entrants and new technologies.
 We are aware of several companies focused on other methods for editing genes and regulating gene expression and a limited number of commercial and academic groups pursuing the development of gene regulation and genome editing technology. The field of applied gene regulation and genome editing is highly competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future from several different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies; academic and research institutions; and government agencies.
 
Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA approval, or commercializing competitive products before us. If we commence commercial product sales, we may be competing against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities, areas in which we have limited or no experience. In addition, any product candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing products that have long histories of safe and effective use.
 The competitive landscape that we are facing is as follows:
 Gene therapy companies developing gene-based products in clinical trials. uniQure N.V.’s product for lipoprotein lipase deficiency and GlaxoSmithKline plc’s, or GSK, product for severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency are approved in Europe. No other gene therapy products have yet been approved. Our competitors in this category may include, but not be limited to, Sangamo, uniQure N.V., bluebird bio, Inc., Regenxbio Inc., Shire, Pfizer, and GSK.
 Cell therapy companies developing cell-based products. Our competitors in this category may include Novartis AG, Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC, Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite Pharma, and Iovance Biotechnologies, Inc.

For ENOB-HV-01, we are aware of two companies developing a gene therapy for HIV/AIDS: Sangamo and American Gene Technology.
 For ENOB-HV-11 and ENOB-HV-12, we are aware of a few biotech companies developing an HIV vaccine such as Geovax, Biosantech SA, FIT Biotech, among a few others.
 
For ENO--DC-11, the competitive landscape is more complex.
 Immunotherapy is an active area of research and a number of immune-related products have been identified in recent years that are alleged to modulate the immune system. Many of these products utilize dendritic cells, a form of immune cell that presents cancer target peptides to T cells and that can in turn result in T cell activation. More recently, bi-specific antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors (for instance PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies) have been identified as having utility in the treatment of cancer. Bi-specific antibodies commonly target both the cancer peptide and the T cell receptors (“TCR”), thus bringing both cancer cells and T cells into close proximity to maximize the chance of TCR binding and hence an immune response to the cancer cells. Checkpoint inhibitors on the other hand work by targeting receptors that inhibit T cell effectiveness and proliferation and essentially activate T cells. Other immunotherapies that are being actively investigated include antibody-drug complexes, TCR-mimic antibodies, oncolytic viruses, and cancer vaccines. A variety of cell-based autologous and allogeneic approaches are also being researched and developed.
 
CAR-T in solid tumors
 In addition to hematological malignancies, there are a growing number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and academic institutions researching and developing autologous and allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T cell (“CAR-T”) therapies in the solid tumor setting. These CAR-T cell therapies are at a variety of stages of preclinical and clinical development, as well as directed towards a broad target spectrum. Two Car-T therapies has been approved for treatment of leukemia
 CARs&TCR-mimics targeting peptide-HLA complexes
 Most CAR-T therapies in development are directed towards antigen targets. However, competitors are also developing a CAR-T that selectively binds to the peptide-HLA (pHLA) complex (the natural binding site for endogenous TCR). Furthermore, competitors are also looking at pHLA antibodies or TCR mimic antibodies that can either be engineered in T cells or developed as standalone antibody therapies in cancer indications (including solid tumors).
 TCRTcells
 Competitors are developing TCR T cells (including affinity engineered T cells) that are directed towards a multitude of targets. Juno Therapeutics has developed an engineered TCR therapeutic candidate where the end TCR is purported to have enhanced affinity through stem-cell selection.
 Other cell-based approaches
 In addition to all the adoptive cell therapy approaches above, our competitors are also investigating the potential of GammaDelta T cell, CAR-NK cell, NK cell, NKT cell and CTLs either in a preclinical or clinical setting (both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors).
 Manufacturing
 Our intent is to rely on contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), to produce our preclinical and clinical product candidates in accordance with FDA and EMA mandated regulations, also known as current good manufacturing practices, (“cGMPs”). We employ a technical operations staff in the areas of process development, analytical development, quality control, quality assurance, project management, and manufacturing, which will facilitate appropriate oversight of our CMOs, support of our regulatory filings and execution of clinical trials.
Government Regulation
 FDA Review and Approval 
 Any products we develop will require regulatory review and allowance to proceed prior to conducting clinical trials and additional regulatory approvals prior to commercialization. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act and their implementing regulations govern, among other things, biopharmaceutical testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and other promotional practices.
 Obtaining FDA approval is a costly and time-consuming process. Generally, FDA approval requires that preclinical studies be conducted in the laboratory and in animal model systems to gain preliminary information on efficacy and to identify any major safety concerns. The results of these studies are then submitted as a part of an IND, which the FDA must review and allow before human clinical trials can start. The IND includes a detailed description of the proposed clinical investigations. An independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) must also review the clinical protocol.
 A company must submit an IND for each investigational medical product and specific indication(s), and must conduct clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product necessary to obtain FDA approval. The FDA receives reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing and may require the modification, suspension, or termination of clinical trials if an unwarranted risk ispresented to patients.

 To obtain FDA approval prior to marketing a biopharmaceutical product in the United States typically requires several phases of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Clinical trials are the means by which experimental treatments are tested in humans and are conducted following preclinical testing. Clinical trials may be conducted within the United States or in foreign countries. If clinical trials are conducted in foreign countries, the products under development as well as the trials are subject to regulations of the FDA and/or its regulatory counterparts in the other countries. Upon successful completion of clinical trials, approval to market the treatment for a particular patient population may be requested from the FDA in the United States and/or its counterparts in other countries.
 Clinical trials for therapeutic products are normally conducted in three phases. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically conducted with a small number of patients to evaluate safety, determine a safe dosage range, identify side effects, and, if possible, gain early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted with a larger group of patients to evaluate effectiveness of an investigational product for a defined patient population, and to determine common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 3 clinical trials involve large scale, multi-center, comparative trials that are conducted to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling. In some special cases where the efficacy testing of a product may present a special challenge to testing in humans, such as in the case of a vaccine to protect healthy humans from a life-threatening disease that is not a naturally occurring threat, effectiveness testing may be required in animals. For certainadvanced therapies that meet eligibility criteria for expedited program Designations, clinical development may be expedited.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research that utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
 After completion of clinical trials of a new product, FDA marketing approval must be obtained. If the product is regulated as a biologic, a Biologics License Application, or BLA, is required. If the product is classified as a new drug, a New Drug Application, or NDA is required. The NDA or BLA must include results of product development activities, preclinical studies, and clinical trials in addition to detailed chemistry, manufacturing and control information.
 Applications submitted to the FDA are subject to an unpredictable and potentially prolonged approval process. Despite good-faith communication and collaboration between the applicant and the FDA during the development process, the FDA may ultimately decide, upon final review of the data, that the application does not satisfy its criteria for approval or requires additional product development or further preclinical or clinical studies. Even if FDA regulatory approval(s) are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.
 Before marketing approval for a product can be secured, the facility in which the product is manufactured must be inspected by the FDA and must comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, (“cGMP”) regulations. In addition, after marketing approval is secured, the manufacturing facility must be inspected periodically for cGMP compliance by FDA inspectors, and, if the facility is located in California, by inspectors from the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services.
 Sponsors of clinical trials are required to register, and report results for, all controlled, clinical investigations, other than Phase 1 investigations, of a product subject to FDA regulation. Trial registration may require public disclosure of certain confidential commercial development data.
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for such product for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. If a product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.

Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may also be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These additional healthcare regulations could affect our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors. Such laws potentially applicable to our operations include:
 • The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act or ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate, in order to commit a violation.
 • Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which may be enforced through whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, or for providing medically unnecessary services or items.
 • The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 • HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, require certain types of individuals and entities to protect the privacy, security, and electronic exchange of certain patient data. • The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members.
 • Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by third party payors, including private insurers. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. Further, we may be subject to state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and healthcare entities, or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these federal, state, local or foreign laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, administrative or civil penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional integrity obligations, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Reimbursement and Health Reform 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels.
 In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication.

-

 
Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product.
 There are ongoing efforts by governmental and third-party payers to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various reform measures. For example, in the United States, the Federal government passed comprehensive healthcare reform legislation, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, in 2010. With respect to pharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered by Medicaid and made changes to the coverage requirements under Medicare Part D, Medicare’s prescription drug benefits program. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of any certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law, including the repeal, effective January 1, 2019, of the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated by the ACA, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Moreover, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or repeal and replace elements of the ACA. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible repeal and replacement has on our business.
 In addition, drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies continues to be under increased scrutiny. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the out of-pocket cost of prescription drugs, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contains additional drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2020 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our current product candidates and those for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future.
 Further, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services. If purchasers or users of our products are not able to obtain adequate reimbursement for the cost of using our products, they may forego or reduce their use. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products, and whether adequate third-party coverage will be available.
 We also are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted.

Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated in January 18, 2011 in the state of Delaware under the name “Putnam Hills Corp.” We filed a Registration Statement on Form 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on August 12, 2011. On February 12, 2014, pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement, the Registrant acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of DanDrit Denmark As a result, the Registrant changed its name to DanDrit Biotech USA, Inc. and became DanDrit Denmark’s parent company (the “Share Exchange”). Prior to the Share Exchange, the Registrant and an existing shareholder agreed to cancel 4,400,000 out of 5,000,000 shares of common stock of DanDrit Denmark outstanding, and the Registrant issued 1,440,000 shares of Common Stock for legal and consulting services related to the Share Exchange and a future public offering. At the time of the Share Exchange each outstanding share of common stock of DanDrit Denmark was exchanged for 1.498842 shares of Common Stock, for a total of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock, resulting in 8,040,000 shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately following the Share Exchange, including the Escrow Shares, which are deemed issued and outstanding for accounting purposes (See also Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
 
On February 16, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Enochian Biopharma pursuant to an acquisition agreement, dated January 12, 2018, by and among the Registrant, its wholly owned subsidiary DanDrit Acquisition Sub, Inc., Enochian Biopharma and Weird Science (the “Acquisition Agreement”), with Enochian Biopharma surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant. As consideration for the acquisition, the stockholders of Enochian Biopharma received (i) 18,081,962 shares of Common Stock and (ii) the right to receive Contingent Shares pro rata upon the exercise or conversion of warrants which were outstanding at closing (See also Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
 
On March 2, 2018, we changed our name from “DanDrit Biotech USA, Inc.” to Enochian BioSciences, Inc.” We began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on December 10, 2018 under the ticker “ENOB.”

Emerging Growth Company
 
As a Company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. An “emerging growth company” may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

● | Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced disclosure of financial information in this report, limited to two years of audited financial information and two years of selected financial information. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Each of the foregoing exemptions is currently available to us. We may take advantage of these exemptions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, which such fifth anniversary will occur on June 30, 2020. The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies; provided, however, that an emerging growth company may elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have not elected to opt out of the transition period.
 
Because we have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
