Item 1. Business
The Company
 SunOpta Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Canada in 1973, is a U.S.-based global pioneer fueling the future of sustainable, plant-based and fruit-based foods and beverages. With a focus on health and sustainability, the core of our diverse product portfolio is our range of non-genetically modified ("non-GMO"), organic, and gluten-free plant-based beverages, including oat, almond, soy, coconut and rice milks and creamers, which have a favorable climate profile relative to traditional dairy milks in terms of lower carbon emissions and water usage.
 We manufacture and sell the following:
 
private label products to retail and foodservice customers;


branded products under co-manufacturing agreements to other branded food companies for their distribution;


branded products under our own proprietary brands to retail and foodservice customers; and


bulk ingredients for use by foodservice customers and other food manufacturers.

 Our employees and 10 manufacturing facilities are principally located in the U.S., as well as Mexico and Canada. Our corporate headquarters is located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, together with our innovation center and pilot plant.
 Reportable Segments and Principal Products
 The following is a description of the principal activities and products that comprise our operating and reportable segments:
 
Plant-Based Foods and Beverages - We offer a full line of plant-based beverages and liquid and powder ingredients, utilizing oat, almond, soy, coconut, rice, hemp, and other bases, as well as everyday broths, teas, and nutritional beverages. In addition, our former sunflower business, which packaged dry- and oil-roasted inshell sunflower and sunflower kernels and processed raw sunflower inshell and kernel for food and feed applications, was part of this segment until it was sold on October 11, 2022.


Fruit-Based Foods and Beverages - We offer individually quick frozen ("IQF") fruit for retail, including strawberries, blueberries, mango, pineapple, and other berries and blends, and IQF and bulk frozen fruit for foodservice, including toppings, purées, and smoothies. In addition, we offer fruit snacks, including bars, twists, ropes, and bite-sized varieties, as well as fruit smoothie bowls.

 In 2022, we derived 60% (2021 - 58%) of our revenues from the sale of plant-based foods and beverages, and 40% (2021 - 42%) from the sale of fruit-based offerings.
 Additional information regarding our segments is presented in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements at Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
 Recent Developments
 Midlothian, Texas, Manufacturing Facility
 In February 2023, we officially opened our newly constructed, 285,000 square foot plant-based beverage manufacturing facility in Midlothian, Texas. As part of a three-year, approximately $200 million capital investment into our plant-based manufacturing operations, this facility significantly increases our plant-based beverage production capacity and capabilities, including the addition of 330 milliliter packaging options, which is the common format for nutritional beverages. Together with our existing plant-based production facilities in California, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania, the Texas location completes our "diamond-shaped" manufacturing network within the U.S., allowing us to be nearer to the markets we serve in order to lower transportation usage and reduce carbon emissions. Additionally, the Midlothian facility was constructed using recycled and recyclable materials where feasible and has been fitted with resource efficient heating and cooling, water treatment, and lighting systems.

We commenced commercial production on the first high-speed aseptic processing and packaging line in February 2023, with the start-up of the 330-milliliter packaging line planned for the second quarter of 2023. Production levels and plant utilization within the facility are expected to ramp-up through 2024, as we continue our business development efforts to fill remaining open capacity.
 Sale of Sunflower Business
 On October 11, 2022, we completed the sale of 100% of the assets and liabilities of our sunflower business and related roasted snacks operations, which operated from three processing facilities located in Minnesota and North Dakota. The sale of the sunflower commodity business was consistent with our strategic priority of optimizing our non-core businesses and focusing on high-growth, high-return opportunities.
Customers and Competition
 We sell our plant-based and fruit-based food and beverage products through various distribution channels, including large retailers and club stores, branded food companies, foodservice distributors, quick service and casual dining restaurants, and food manufacturers, located principally in the U.S. We generally conduct our business with customers based on purchase orders or pursuant to contracts that are terminable by either party following a designated notice period. However, some of our contracts may extend for several years and/or include volume purchase commitments. In 2022, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 74% of our consolidated revenues, including approximately 72% of our Plant-Based Foods and Beverages segment revenues and approximately 76% of our Fruit-Based Foods and Beverages segment revenues.
 Our plant-based and fruit-based food and beverage operations compete with major branded and private-label food manufacturers. Our customers do not typically commit to buy predetermined amounts of products and many customers utilize bidding procedures to select vendors. As a result, price is often a key competitive factor in winning bids and retaining customers, along with product quality, food safety, innovation, and customer service. We believe that our access to an established network of growers and suppliers, the strategic locations of our manufacturing and distribution facilities, our in-house processing and packaging capabilities, and our innovation center and pilot plant, allows us to compete effectively.
 Raw Materials
 Our raw materials primarily consist of agricultural commodities and ingredients. Principal commodities included in our products include strawberries, oats, almonds, and soybeans. Fresh and frozen berries are sourced directly from growers and suppliers primarily located in Mexico, the U.S., and South America. We source oats, almonds, and soybeans directly from established suppliers mainly within the U.S. and Canada. For critical raw materials, we identify and qualify alternate sources of supply, where possible. For certain organic ingredients, we are party to a long-term supply agreement with Tradin Organic, our former global organic ingredients business, which we sold in 2020.
 Agricultural commodities and ingredients are subject to fluctuations in market price caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, including inflationary cost increases, and other factors beyond our control. Where possible, we mitigate the input price volatility by entering into annual purchase arrangements with our suppliers and by incorporating pass-through pricing adjustment clauses into our contracts with customers.
 We rely on our packaging suppliers to ensure delivery of often unique, portable, and convenient consumer packaging formats. In our plant-based beverage processing facilities, we specialize in the use of Tetra Pak processing and packaging equipment in a variety of package sizes, and an array of opening types and extended shelf-life options. Over 95% of our packaging by weight is recyclable, and we are committed to working with our suppliers to innovate and develop new packaging technologies to further reduce the impact on the environment, while maintaining the quality and safety of our products.
 Natural gas and electricity are the primary sources of energy used to power our plants and processing equipment, and water is the principal ingredient in many of our products and is essential to our production processes.
 Diesel fuel is used in connection with the distribution of our products, and we rely on third-party transportation providers to deliver raw materials, as well as our products to our customers.
 Seasonality
 We experience seasonality in the procurement, transportation, and processing of strawberries, mainly related to the peak Mexico and California production seasons, which generally occur during the first two quarters of the year. As a result, our short-term financing needs are generally highest in those periods due to crop inventory builds, while cash inflows are typically higher in the second half of the year as inventories are drawn down. Overall, the demand for most of our products does not typically fluctuate significantly in any particular season; however, sales of everyday broths are generally highest in the first and fourth quarters of each year.

Product Development
 Our 24,000 square foot innovation center and pilot plant located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, supports our product development team of 27 highly trained and experienced food scientists and technologists that are dedicated to the development of innovative food and beverage offerings and addressing product development opportunities for our customers. These opportunities include new and custom formulations, innovations in packaging formats, and new production processes and applications. Applications and technical support provided to our customers include all aspects of product development from concept to commercial launch, as well as ongoing manufacturing and processing support.
Trademarks
 We market our own consumer brands under trademarks that we own, including SOWN™, Dream™, West Life™ (formerly WestSoy™) and Sunrise Growers™. While we consider these trademarks to be valuable to the marketing and sale of our proprietary brands, we do not consider any trademark to be of such material importance that its absence would cause a material disruption of our business.
Human Capital
 Our Human Capital Management strategy is based on our goal of "Putting the YOU in SunOpta." We develop employee programs, benefits, and compensation to align with four pillars of well-being: physical, financial, social, and emotional. Examples of these initiatives are:


Offering a competitive compensation and benefit package that includes "choices" for each employee to select which works best for them. Our comprehensive benefits package includes health insurance, company-paid life, accident, and disability insurance, 401(k), employee stock purchase plan, paid time off, paid parental and maternity leave programs, flexible schedules, and a tuition reimbursement program. At the end of 2022, we announced two additional paid personal holidays for our regular, full-time employees called "You Days," which can be taken in recognition of an employee's birthday and work anniversary date.


We believe it is key to give back to the communities in which we live and work as evidenced by our community service and volunteerism program, which we refer to as "SunOpta Cares." This program provides 24 hours of paid time off for our employees to volunteer with community programs that align with their values. Throughout the year, employees have several opportunities to donate talent and gifts to local charitable organizations.


Talent management and growth is instrumental in developing a sustainable workforce. We provide various opportunities for our employees to learn and grow within SunOpta through individual development plans, on-the-job training, special project assignments, monthly safety training and regular leader led learning sessions. In 2022, we implemented a new Foundational Manager Program created for managers and supervisors with a focus on cross-functional leadership, effective communication, leading through change, influencing with integrity, negotiating, and creative problem solving. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation leaders. On an annual basis, we conduct talent assessments across the organization and succession planning for our most critical roles within the organization to identify high potential employees, gaps in capabilities or skills, and bench strength.


We believe in the power of diversity. We provide training regarding diversity, equity and inclusion for employees to better understand how we can all work together, and be better, by embracing our differences. We foster inclusion by recognizing and supporting activities and initiatives representative of our workforce such as celebrations of Black History month, Hispanic Heritage month, PRIDE, National Native American Heritage month, and our Women's Leadership Program. In 2022, we also kicked off programming for our Hispanic Employee Resource Group.


 We encourage our employees to be guided by our MVBs (Most Valued Behaviors) of speed, dedication, problem solving, passion, entrepreneurship, and customer centricity. We have a peer recognition program which allows employees to recognize others who are demonstrating our MVBs. Our leaders also recognize employees through our quarterly awards program. SunOpta conducts an organizational health survey two times each year to check the pulse of our workforce and look for areas of improvement through the lens of all our employees. The average of our survey scores this year were 4.0 on a five-point scale. We engage in communication efforts such as quarterly town halls and monthly all-company huddles that we believe help employees feel they are a part of SunOpta as a whole, not just their individual department or location.

-------------+---+----------------------------


As of December 31, 2022, we employed 1,453 full-time employees and 493 seasonal employees in North America. Excluding our newly constructed Midlothian facility, our average employee has four years of service and our annual voluntary turnover of employees at the director level or above was 1%. In 2022, our voluntary turnover was 22% across the Company. Except for our employees at our Jacona, Mexico, facility, none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining group. We continue to focus on increasing employee retention by implementing retention programs and initiatives to increase employee engagement. Employee health and safety is paramount to our success. In addition to our safety training and initiatives at our manufacturing facilities, we track our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) which ended the year at 1.44, compared to a goal of 1.6.
 2022 continued to be a challenging year with the continuation of the COVID-19 global pandemic and evolving variants in addition to supply chain issues and labor shortages. We have been successful in mitigating the effect on our employees by proactively implementing measures early and thoroughly and keeping up to date on recommendations and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), state, provincial, and local health departments. Our operations teams continued to hold regular meetings to discuss health and safety protocols, best practices, and address employee concerns. In addition, we continued special pay and leave policies related to COVID-19 through the end of 2022.
 Environmental, Social and Governance
 We are committed to incorporating environmental, social and governance ("ESG") principles into our business strategies and organizational culture. The Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight on ESG matters. Details on our ESG commitments and progress are set out in our most recent ESG report (available at sunopta.com/sustainability), which shall not be deemed to be a part of this Form 10-K or incorporated into any of our other filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or Canadian Securities Administrators (the "CSA").
Regulations
 We are subject to a wide range of governmental regulations and policies in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. These laws, regulations and policies are implemented, as applicable in each jurisdiction, on the national, federal, state, provincial, and local levels. For example, we are affected by laws and regulations related to seed, fertilizer, and pesticides; the purchasing, harvesting, transportation, and warehousing of agricultural products; the processing, packaging, and sale of food and beverages, including wholesale operations; and product labeling and marketing, food safety and food defense. We are also affected by government-sponsored price supports, acreage set aside programs, and a number of environmental regulations.
 U.S. Regulations
 Our activities in the U.S. are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"), and the Departments of Commerce and Labor, as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies. Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities.
 USDA National Organic Program and Similar Regulations
 We manufacture and distribute a number of organic products that are subject to the standards set forth in the Organic Foods Production Act and the regulations adopted thereunder by the National Organic Standards Board. In addition, our organic products may be subject to various state regulations. We believe that we are in material compliance with the organic regulations applicable to our business, and we maintain an organic testing and verification process. Generally, organic food products are produced using:


agricultural management practices intended to promote and enhance ecosystem health;


ingredients produced without genetically engineered seeds or crops, sewage sludge, long-lasting pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides; and


food processing practices intended to protect the integrity of the organic product and disallow irradiation, genetically modified organisms, or synthetic preservatives.



SUNOPTA INC. | 7 | December 31, 2022 Form 10-K
-------------+---+----------------------------


After becoming certified, organic operations must retain records concerning the production, harvesting, and handling of agricultural products that are to be sold as organic for a period of five years. Any organic operation found to be in violation of the USDA organic regulations is subject to potential enforcement actions, which can include financial penalties or suspension or revocation of their organic certificate.
 Food Safety, Labeling and Packaging Regulations
 As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA and the FTC. This regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging, and safety of food in the U.S. state and local statutes and regulations may impose additional food safety, labeling, and packaging requirements. For instance, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (commonly referred to as "Proposition 65") requires, with a few exceptions, that a specific warning appear on any consumer product sold in California that contains a substance, above certain levels, listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. We believe we are in material compliance with state and local statutes and regulations as they apply to our business.
Environmental Regulations
 We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state, and local environmental regulations. Some of the key environmental regulations in the U.S. include, but are not limited to, the following:

Air quality regulations - air quality is regulated by the EPA and certain city/state air pollution control groups. Emission reports are filed annually.


Waste treatment/disposal regulations - solid waste is either disposed of by a third-party or, in some cases, we have a permit to haul and apply the sludge to land. Agreements exist with local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified levels of Biological Oxygen Demand ("BOD"), Total Suspended Solids ("TSS") and other constituents. This can require weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection.


Sewer regulations - we have agreements with the local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified limits of BOD and TSS. This requires weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection.


Hazardous chemicals regulations - various reports are filed with local, city, and state emergency response agencies to identify potential hazardous chemicals being used in our U.S. facilities.


Storm-water - all of our U.S. facilities are inspected annually and must comply with an approved storm-water plan to protect water supplies.

Employee Safety Regulations
 We are subject to certain safety regulations, including OSHA regulations. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations applicable to our business.
 Canadian and Other Non-U.S. Regulations
 In Canada, the sale of food is regulated under various federal and provincial laws, principally (but not limited to) the Safe Food for Canadians Act ("SFCA"), the Food and Drugs Act ("FADA"), the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act ("CCPSA"), the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act ("CFIAA") and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 ("CEPA"), along with their supporting regulations. The following is a summary of each of these statutes to the extent that they apply or potentially apply to the Company and its operations:
 
Safe Food for Canadians Regulations ("SFCR") (under the SFCA) - the SFCR came into effect on January 15, 2019, and consolidated 14 sets of existing food regulations into a single set of regulations which governs all imported, exported, or inter-provincially traded food products. Some provisions of the SFCA and SFCR also apply intra-provincially. Notably, SFCR replaced the Organic Products Regulations, 2009, the Processed Products Regulations and, to the extent that they related to food products, the Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act and its supporting regulations. Principal elements of the SCFR that may impact the Company include licensing requirements, preventative controls, traceability requirements, commodity-specific requirements, reporting requirements and timelines, an export certificate request process, packaging and labeling requirements to ensure food safety and prevent false or misleading labeling, regulation of the use of grades and grade names, standards of identity and expansion of the certification process for organic products, and other requirements. Timelines for complying with the SFCR requirements vary by food, activity, and size of the food business.

-------------+---+----------------------------


Food and Drug Regulations (under the FADA) - food and drugs are subject to specific regulatory requirements, including composition (such as food additives, fortification, and food standards), packaging, labeling, advertising, and marketing, and licensing requirements. New requirements regarding nutrition and ingredient labeling and food color were introduced in 2016. In 2022, the Government of Canada, with support from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (the "CFIA"), amended the Food and Drug Regulations to update the requirements for labelling pre-packaged food products. The amendments to the Food and Drug Regulations are part of the CFIA's initiative to modernize Canada's food labelling system.


Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act ("CFIAA") - the CFIAA grants power to the CFIA, which is tasked with the administration and enforcement of certain Canadian food legislation. By virtue of the CFIAA and the SFCA, the CFIA has the power to inspect and, if deemed necessary, recall certain products, including fresh fruit and vegetables, processed foods, and organic foods, if the Minister of Health believes that such products pose a risk to the public, animal or plant health.


Substance Regulations - various regulations under CEPA regulate the importation and use of certain substances in Canada. For example, prior to the importation and use in products, the importer must ensure that all ingredients are found on the Domestic Substances List ("DSL") maintained by Environment and Climate Change Canada. In the event that an ingredient is not found on the DSL, then subject to the amount of the substance imported into Canada and used in products sold in Canada, a filing may become necessary under the New Substances Notification Regulations.


Canada Consumer Product Safety Act ("CCPSA") - the CCPSA provides oversight and regulation of consumer products with respect to manufacturers, importers, and retailers. It includes, without limitation, the ability to require product recalls, mandatory incident reporting, document retention requirements, increased fines and penalties, and packaging and labeling requirements. While the CCPSA does not apply to food, it does apply to its packaging with respect to safety. It is possible that there will be amendments introduced to the FADA, to capture the essence of the regulatory oversight found in the CCPSA. We have no way of anticipating if and when that may occur.

 In Mexico, our frozen fruit processing facility is subject to Mexican regulations, including regulations regarding processing, packaging, and sales of food products, labor relations and profit-sharing with employees, and water consumption and treatment.
 Environmental Compliance
 As described above, we are subject to environmental regulations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Our business also requires that we have certain permits from various state, provincial and local authorities related to air quality, water consumption and treatment, stormwater discharge, solid waste, land spreading and hazardous waste. We are committed to meeting all applicable environmental compliance requirements.
Intellectual Property
 The nature of a number of our products and processes requires that we create and maintain patents, trade secrets and trademarks. Our policy is to protect our technology, brands, and trademarks by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology relating to the development of our business in the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions, registering trademarks in the U.S., Canada and selected foreign jurisdictions where we sell products, and maintaining confidentiality agreements with outside parties and employees.
 Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our products, trade names and technology under U.S. and international patent laws and other intellectual property laws. We believe that we own or have sufficient rights to use all of the proprietary technology, information and trademarks necessary to manufacture and market our products; however, there is always a risk that patent applications relating to our products or technologies will not result in patents being issued, or, if issued, will be later challenged by a third party, or that current or additional patents will not afford protection against competitors with similar technology.
 We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain technologies and processes. However, even with these steps taken, our outside partners and contract manufacturers could gain access to our proprietary technology and confidential information. All employees are required to adhere to internal policies, which are intended to further protect our technologies, processes, and trade secrets.
