Company Overview and Highlights
 Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (“Acorda” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. We market Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder), which is approved in the U.S. for intermittent treatment of OFF episodes, also known as OFF periods, in people with Parkinson’s disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa. Inbrija is for as needed use and utilizes our ARCUS pulmonary delivery system, a technology platform designed to deliver medication through inhalation that we believe has potential to be used in the development of a variety of inhaled medicines. We also market branded Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg to improve walking in adults with multiple sclerosis.
Our Products
 Inbrija/Parkinson’s Disease
 Inbrija is the first and only inhaled levodopa, or L-dopa, for intermittent treatment of OFF periods in people with Parkinson’s disease treated with a carbidopa/levodopa regimen. Approximately one million people in the U.S. and 1.2 million Europeans are diagnosed with Parkinson’s; it is estimated that approximately 40% of people with Parkinson’s in the U.S. experience OFF periods. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Inbrija is for a single dose of 84 mg (administered as two capsules), which may be taken up to five times per day. Currently, Inbrija is available in the U.S. without the need for a medical exception for approximately 92% of commercially insured lives and approximately 18% of Medicare plan lives. U.S. net revenue for Inbrija was $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Inbrija is also approved for use in the European Union (EU). The European Commission (EC)-approved Inbrija dose is 66 mg (administered as two capsules) up to five times per day (per EU convention, this reflects emitted dose and is equivalent to the 84 mg labeled dose in the U.S.). Under the EU approval, Inbrija is indicated for the intermittent treatment of episodic motor fluctuations (OFF episodes) in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease treated with a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor. We have entered into agreements to commercialize Inbrija in Spain, Germany, and Latin America, and we are in discussions with potential partners for commercialization of Inbrija in other jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Net revenues for ex-U.S. Inbrija sales in Germany were $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
 Inbrija utilizes our ARCUS platform for inhaled therapeutics. Because of our limited financial resources, we previously suspended work on ARCUS and other proprietary research and development programs. However, we continue to discuss the use of ARCUS with companies that express interest in formulating their novel molecules for pulmonary delivery, and we have performed feasibility studies for a number of these opportunities.
 Ampyra/MS
 Ampyra is an extended-release tablet formulation of dalfampridine approved by the FDA as a treatment to improve walking in patients with multiple sclerosis, or MS. Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from several generic versions of Ampyra. Additional manufacturers may market generic versions of Ampyra, and we expect our Ampyra sales will continue to decline over time. U.S. net revenue for Ampyra was $72.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen International GmbH, or Biogen, under a license and collaboration agreement that we entered into in June 2009. Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Our Fampyra patents have been challenged in Germany and could be similarly challenged in other countries where Fampyra is marketed by Biogen, and these challenges could lead to generic competition with Fampyra, which could have a material adverse effect on royalty revenue from Biogen. For example, we understand that a generic drug manufacturer that has sought to invalidate Fampyra patents in Germany through nullity proceedings has commenced a generic launch in Germany. See Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this report for more information.


Sale of Chelsea Manufacturing Operations and Catalent MSA
 On February 10, 2021, the Company sold its Chelsea manufacturing operations to Catalent Pharma Solutions. In connection with the sale, the Company entered into a long-term, global manufacturing services (supply) agreement (the “2021 MSA") with a Catalent affiliate pursuant to which they agreed to manufacture Inbrija for the Company at the Chelsea facility. The 2021 MSA provided that Catalent would manufacture Inbrija, to the Company’s specifications, and the Company would purchase Inbrija exclusively from Catalent during the term of the 2021 MSA; provided that such exclusivity requirement will not apply to Inbrija intended for sale in China. Under the 2021 MSA, the Company was obligated to make minimum purchase commitments for Inbrija of $18 million annually through the expiration of the agreement on December 31, 2030.
In December 2021, the Company and Catalent amended the 2021 MSA to adjust the structure of the minimum payment terms for the period from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 (the “Adjustment Period”). Under the amendment, the minimum payment obligation for the Adjustment Period was replaced with payments to Catalent for actual product delivered during the Adjustment Period subject to a cap for the Adjustment Period that corresponds to its original minimum purchase obligation for that period (i.e., $17 million), and with certain payments being made in the first half of 2022 instead of during the second half of 2021. As a result of the amendment, payments to Catalent for product delivered during the Adjustment Period were approximately $8.4 million less than the $17 million minimum inventory purchase obligation for that period. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred approximately $18.7 million of purchase commitments with Catalent, of which $11.5 million are recognized as inventory within our balance sheet, $3.3 million are recognized as other current assets within our balance sheet and $3.9 million are recognized as cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations for the period.
 On December 31, 2022, we and Catalent entered into a termination letter, which was subsequently amended and restated in March 2023 (the “Termination Letter”) to terminate the 2021 MSA. In connection with the termination of the 2021 MSA, we will pay a $4 million termination fee to Catalent, payable in April 2024. The parties also entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement with respect to certain batches of Inbrija that were not delivered in 2022 as scheduled, and are to be delivered in the first quarter of 2023, and to resolve all other outstanding manufacturing issues.
 Effective January 1, 2023, we entered into a new manufacturing services agreement (as amended in March 2023, the “New MSA”) with Catalent. Under the New MSA, Catalent will continue to manufacture Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder) through 2030, with reduced minimum annual commitments through 2024 and significantly lower pricing thereafter. The New MSA provides for the scale-up of new spray drying equipment (“PSD-7”), which will provide expanded capacity for the long-term world-wide manufacturing requirements of Inbrija, and is expected to be operational in 2026. In March 2023, we amended the New MSA to adjust certain payment obligations. Under the New MSA, we will be subject to purchase commitments in 2023 and 2024 of 15 and 24 batches of Inbrija, respectively, at a total cost of $10.5 million and $15.5 million, respectively. Thereafter, in 2025, we will pay Catalent a fixed per capsule fee based on the amount of Inbrija that is delivered for sale in the United States and other markets. In addition, we will be obligated to pay Catalent $2 million in 2023 in connection with certain activities related to the operational readiness of the PSD-7.
 It is anticipated that by 2026, the PSD-7 equipment will be fully operational, which will significantly reduce the per capsule fees for all markets. We have agreed to a minimum purchase requirement of at least three batches per year on the PSD-7 equipment. In addition to the operational readiness payment described above, we will provide up to $1 million in each of 2023 and 2024 for capital expenditures to assist in the capacity expansion efforts.
 The New MSA, unless earlier terminated, will continue until December 31, 2030, and will be automatically extended for successive two-year periods unless either we or Catalent provides the other with at least 18-months’ prior written notice of non-renewal. Either party may terminate the New MSA by written notice under certain circumstances, including material breach (subject to specified cure periods) or insolvency. We may also terminate the New MSA upon specified regulatory events and for convenience upon 180 days’ prior written notice.
 We agreed to purchase from Catalent all of our requirements for Inbrija for the United States, Germany, Spain and Latin America, except in the case of termination or certain supply disruptions. For China, we are not required to purchase our supply from Catalent and may arrange for an alternate supplier. For other countries, we may be released from exclusivity as long as we purchase at least two batches from Catalent in the applicable year, subject to certain rights of first refusal on alternative source of supply arrangements.


The foregoing descriptions of the New MSA, the Termination Letter and the Settlement and Release Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such documents, which are filed as exhibits to this report.
 Convertible Notes
 In December 2019, we completed a private exchange of $276 million of our convertible senior notes due 2021 in exchange for a combination of approximately $207 million aggregate principal amount of newly-issued convertible senior secured notes due 2024 and $55.2 million in cash. As a result of the exchange, approximately $69 million of convertible senior notes due in 2021 remained outstanding, but we repaid these notes at maturity on June 15, 2021 using cash on hand. Based on the current market price of our common stock and our remaining authorized shares of common stock that are not reserved for other purposes, we believe that for the foreseeable future we will be unable to make interest payments on the 2024 notes in stock. More information about the terms and conditions of the 2024 convertible notes is set forth in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report as well as in Financing Arrangements in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this report.
Financial Management
 In September 2021, we exercised our early termination option (the “Early Termination Option”) under our lease for our corporate headquarters in Ardsley, N.Y. In connection with the lease termination, we paid an early termination fee of approximately $4.7 million in June 2022 and relocated our corporate headquarters to a substantially smaller subleased office in Pearl River, New York.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of approximately $44.7 million. Restricted cash includes $6.2 million in escrow related to the 6% semi-annual interest portion of our convertible senior secured notes due June 2024, which interest is payable in cash or stock. If we elect to pay interest due in stock, a corresponding amount of restricted cash will be released from escrow. In connection with the June 1, 2022 interest payment on the 2024 notes, we issued an aggregate of 10,992,206 shares of common stock to holders of the notes and, to certain holders who delivered beneficial ownership limitation notices under the indenture governing the 2024 notes, cash interest payments of $0.9 million. In connection with the interest payment, $6.2 million was released from escrow and became available to us for other purposes. In connection with the December 1, 2022 interest payment of the 2024 notes we paid $6.2 million from restricted escrow cash. Based on the current market price of our common stock and our remaining authorized shares of common stock that are not reserved for other purposes, we believe that for the foreseeable future we will be unable to make interest payments on the 2024 notes in stock.
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 Our business and financial condition have been impacted by, and are subject to risks resulting from, the COVID-19 global pandemic. The COVID-19 global pandemic has caused significant disruptions in the healthcare industry, including disruptions to the delivery of patient healthcare; for example, the pandemic has made it more difficult for some patients to visit with their physician and obtain pharmaceutical prescriptions. We also believe that the governmental and other restrictions and requirements related to the pandemic may have caused certain patients to lessen their mobility and therefore their need for certain therapeutics. We believe these factors contributed to volatility in new Inbrija prescriptions since the start of the pandemic in 2020 and have continued to impact prescriptions in 2022, particularly in the first quarter due to the surge in COVID-related cases.
COVID-related policies, restrictions, and concerns may disrupt our operations and those of our customers and suppliers. Also, our operations could be interrupted if we or our customers or suppliers lose the services of key employees or consultants who become ill from COVID-19. These types of disruptions could potentially affect any of our critical business functions, and thus harm our business, including for example our sales and marketing operations, as well as compliance and certain general and administrative functions. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Our Strategy
 Our long-term strategy is to grow as a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company and to become a leading neurology company dedicated to the identification, development and commercialization of therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. For 2023, our strategic priorities include:
 •Accelerate Inbrija Growth: Driving the commercial success of Inbrija by continuing our efforts to enhance patient experience, re-engaging physicians as the COVID pandemic recedes, and commercializing Inbrija outside the U.S. through our collaboration partners.
 •Maintain Ampyra Strength: Continuing to support the Ampyra franchise, including activities intended to maintain brand loyalty and market access.
 •Optimize Financial Structure: Continuing to focus on financial discipline and optimizing our cost structure.
 •Leverage ARCUS Platform: Building on the ARCUS technology platform by seeking collaborations with companies to potentially formulate their novel molecules for pulmonary delivery using ARCUS.

 Inbrija utilizes our ARCUS platform for inhaled therapeutics. ARCUS is a dry-powder pulmonary drug delivery technology that we believe has potential to be used in the development of a variety of inhaled medicines. The ARCUS platform allows systemic delivery of medication through inhalation, by transforming molecules into a light, porous dry powder. This allows delivery of substantially higher doses of medication than can be delivered via conventional dry powder technologies. Although we have deferred internal investment in ARCUS research programs, we continue to discuss potential collaborations with companies that express interest in formulating their novel molecules for pulmonary delivery using ARCUS, and we have performed feasibility studies for a number of these opportunities.
 Background on Neurological Conditions
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. Our current strategic priorities include marketing our approved Inbrija and Ampyra therapeutics targeted to the conditions described below. We believe there is significant unmet medical need for these conditions, which can severely impact the lives of those who suffer from them.
Parkinson’s Disease
 Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the gradual loss of certain neurons in the brain. These neurons are responsible for producing dopamine and that loss causes a range of symptoms including impaired movement, muscle stiffness and tremors. Approximately one million people in the U.S. and 1.2 million Europeans suffer from Parkinson’s. There is no cure or disease-modifying treatment currently available for Parkinson’s disease. Current treatment strategies are focused on the management and reduction of the major symptoms of the disease and related

disabilities. These therapies either aim to supplement dopamine levels in the brain, mimic the effect of dopamine in the brain by stimulating dopamine receptors or prevent the enzymatic breakdown of dopamine. The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms is oral carbidopa/levodopa. Approximately 70% of people with Parkinson’s in the U.S. are treated with oral carbidopa/levodopa. Effective control of Parkinson’s disease symptoms is referred to as an ON state.
 As Parkinson’s disease progresses, people are likely to experience OFF periods, also known as OFF episodes, which are characterized by the return of Parkinson’s symptoms, which can occur despite underlying baseline therapy. Even optimized regimens of oral carbidopa/levodopa are associated with increasingly wide variability in the timing and amount of absorption into the bloodstream. This results in the unreliable control of symptoms, leading to motor complications including OFF periods. OFF periods can increase in frequency and severity during the course of the disease, and remain one of the most challenging aspects of the disease despite optimized regimens with current therapeutic options and strategies. About half of the people with Parkinson’s treated with levodopa therapy experience OFF periods within five years of initiating treatment. For the approximately 350,000 people in the U.S. and 420,000 in Europe who experience them, OFF periods are inadequately addressed by available therapies and are considered one of the greatest unmet medical needs facing people with Parkinson’s. OFF periods can be very disruptive to the lives of people with Parkinson’s, their families and caregivers. In a survey of 3,000 people with Parkinson’s conducted by the Michael J. Fox Foundation, 64% of respondents reported having at least two hours of OFF time per day.
 Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, is a chronic, usually progressive disease in which the immune system attacks and degrades the function of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. These nerve fibers consist of long, thin fibers, or axons, surrounded by a myelin sheath, which facilitates the transmission of electrical impulses, much as insulation facilitates conduction in an electrical wire. In MS, the myelin sheath is damaged by the body's own immune system, causing areas of myelin sheath loss, also known as demyelination. This damage, which can occur at multiple sites in the central nervous system, blocks or diminishes conduction of electrical impulses. Patients with MS may suffer impairments in a wide range of neurological functions. These impairments vary from individual to individual and over the course of time, depending on which parts of the brain and spinal cord are affected, and often include difficulty walking. Individuals vary in the severity of the impairments they suffer on a day-to-day basis, with impairments becoming better or worse depending on the activity of the disease on a given day.
 Approximately 1,000,000 people in the U.S. suffer from MS, and each year approximately 10,000 people in the U.S. are newly diagnosed. In a poll of more than 2,000 people with MS, 87% said they experienced some limitation to their walking ability and limited activities that involved walking. Among MS patients diagnosed within the last 5 years, 58% report experiencing mobility issues at least twice a week. In the European Union, over 700,000 people suffer from MS, and an additional 100,000 people in Canada are also diagnosed with this disease.
 Inbrija and ARCUS
 Inbrija/Parkinson’s Disease
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder) is the first and only inhaled levodopa, or L-dopa, for intermittent treatment of OFF episodes, also known as OFF periods, in people with Parkinson’s disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa regimen. Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on December 21, 2018. The approval is for a single dose of 84 mg (administered as two capsules), which may be taken up to five times per day. Inbrija became commercially available in the U.S. in February 2019. Currently, Inbrija is available in the U.S. without the need for a medical exception for approximately 92% of commercially insured lives and approximately 18% of Medicare plan lives. U.S. net revenue for Inbrija was $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
In September 2019, the European Commission, or EC, approved our Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for Inbrija. The approved dose is 66 mg (administered as two capsules) up to five times per day (per European Union, or EU, convention, this reflects emitted dose and is equivalent to the 84 mg labeled dose in the U.S.). Under the MAA, Inbrija is indicated in the EU for the intermittent treatment of episodic motor fluctuations (OFF episodes) in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease treated with a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor. The MAA approved Inbrija for use in what were then the 27 countries of the EU, as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Following the exit of the UK from the EU, we were granted a grandfathered Marketing Authorization (MA) by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK that was approved in November 2021.


We have entered into agreements to commercialize Inbrija in Spain, Germany, and Latin America, and we are in discussions with potential partners for commercialization of Inbrija in other jurisdictions outside of the U.S. In 2021, we entered into exclusive distribution and supply agreements with Esteve Pharmaceuticals to commercialize Inbrija in Spain and Germany. Under the terms of the Germany distribution agreement, in 2021 we received a €5 million (approximately $5.9) upfront payment, and we are entitled to receive additional sales-based milestones. Under the terms of both the Spain and Germany supply agreements, we are entitled to receive a significant double-digit percent of the Inbrija selling price in exchange for supply of the product. Esteve launched Inbrija in Germany in June 2022 and in Spain in February 2023. Net revenues for ex-U.S. Inbrija sales in Germany were $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
 Also, in May 2022, we announced that we entered into exclusive distribution and supply agreements with Pharma Consulting Group, S.A. (known as Biopas Laboratories), or Biopas, to commercialize Inbrija in nine countries within Latin America, including Brazil and Mexico. Under the terms of the Biopas agreements, we are entitled to receive a significant double-digit, tiered percentage of the Inbrija selling price in exchange for supply of the product, and we are entitled to sales-based milestones. Biopas expects to commence sales in at least one country in early 2024.
 ARCUS Platform and Product Development
 Inbrija utilizes our ARCUS platform for inhaled therapeutics. ARCUS is a dry-powder pulmonary drug delivery technology that we believe has potential to be used in the development of a variety of inhaled medicines. The ARCUS platform allows systemic delivery of medication through inhalation, by transforming molecules into a light, porous dry powder. This allows delivery of substantially higher doses of medication than can be delivered via conventional dry powder technologies. We acquired the ARCUS technology platform as part of our 2014 acquisition of Civitas Therapeutics. We have worldwide rights to our ARCUS drug delivery technology, which is protected by extensive know-how and trade secrets and various U.S. and foreign patents, including patents that protect the Inbrija dry powder capsules beyond 2030. We have several patents listed in the Orange Book for Inbrija, including patents expiring between 2024 and 2032. Inbrija was also entitled to three years of new product exclusivity in the U.S. that expired in December 2021. We have patents in Europe for Inbrija expiring in 2033. One of our European patents, EP 3090773B, had been opposed by an unnamed party but in 2021 was maintained as granted by the European Opposition Board. Inbrija also has market exclusivity in Europe that is set to expire in September 2029.
 We believe there are potential opportunities for using ARCUS with central nervous system, or CNS, as well as non-CNS, disorders. Due to several corporate restructurings since 2017 and associated cost-cutting measures, we suspended work on ARCUS and other proprietary research and development programs. However, we continue to discuss potential collaborations with companies that have expressed interest in formulating their novel molecules for pulmonary delivery using ARCUS, and we have performed feasibility studies for a number of these opportunities.
 Should we decide to proceed with any ARCUS development programs, we would be reliant on Catalent or another third-party supplier for the manufacture of product for that program. Our global supply agreement with Catalent does not provide for the terms and conditions under which Catalent would supply any product or product candidate other than Inbrija. We would be unable to advance the development of any ARCUS inhaled therapeutic candidate unless Catalent or another supplier is willing to manufacture the product candidate for us on commercially reasonable terms. Also, due to reductions in force, employee attrition, and the 2021 sale of our Chelsea manufacturing operations, we may need to hire replacement personnel or engage consultants to continue with ARCUS research and development work beyond feasibility and similar early-stage studies.
 
Ampyra
 Ampyra (dalfampridine) is an oral drug approved by the FDA in January 2010 to improve walking in adults with multiple sclerosis. To our knowledge, Ampyra is the first drug approved for this indication. Efficacy was shown in people with all four major types of multiple sclerosis (relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive). Ampyra can be used alone or with concurrent medications, including immunomodulatory drugs. Ampyra is an extended-release tablet formulation of dalfampridine (4-aminopyridine, 4-AP), which had previously been referred to as fampridine. Dalfampridine is a potassium channel blocker. In animal studies, dalfampridine has been shown to increase conduction of nerve signals in demyelinated axons through blocking of potassium channels. The mechanism by which dalfampridine exerts its therapeutic effect has not been fully elucidated.
 Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents. We have experienced a

significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from several generic versions of Ampyra. Additional manufacturers may market generic versions of Ampyra, and we expect our Ampyra sales will continue to decline over time. U.S. net revenue for Ampyra was $72.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
 Prior to October 2022, our primary source of supply of Ampyra was provided through a manufacturing and license agreement with Alkermes plc. In July 2020, we filed an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association against Alkermes after the parties were unable to resolve a dispute over license and supply royalties following the 2018 invalidation of an Alkermes patent relating to Ampyra. In October 2022, an arbitration panel issued a final decision in this dispute and awarded to us $15 million plus prejudgment interest of $1.5 million. In November 2022, the arbitration panel corrected a calculation error and awarded us an additional $1.6 million plus prejudgment interest of approximately $0.2 million. In addition, as a result of the panel’s ruling, we will no longer have to pay Alkermes any royalties on net sales for license and supply of Ampyra, and we are now free to use alternative sources for supply of Ampyra, which we have already secured. We expect the cost savings associated with this decision to greatly benefit the product’s value to us and lower our overall cost of goods sold. For information regarding a recent action by us to modify the arbitration award, see Legal Proceedings in Part 1, Item 3 of this report.
 License and Collaboration Agreement with Biogen
 Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen International GmbH, or Biogen, under a license and collaboration agreement that we entered into in June 2009. Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Biogen recently initiated a commercial launch of Fampyra in China, after receiving approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration in 2021. Our Fampyra patents have been challenged in Germany and could be similarly challenged in other countries where Fampyra is marketed by Biogen. The Germany nullity actions are further described in the Legal Proceedings section of this report. Fampyra currently faces generic competition in Germany, notwithstanding that the Germany Fampyra Patents remain in effect, and challenges to the Fampyra patents could lead to additional generic competition with Fampyra in Germany and other countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our royalty revenue from Biogen.
 Under our agreement with Biogen, we are entitled to receive double-digit tiered royalties on net sales of Fampyra, and we are also entitled to receive additional payments based on achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones, although we do not anticipate achievement of any of those milestones in the foreseeable future. In November 2017, we announced a $40 million Fampyra royalty monetization transaction with HealthCare Royalty Partners, or HCRP. In return for the payment to us, HCRP obtained the right to receive these Fampyra royalties up to an agreed-upon threshold, as described in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. This threshold was met during the second quarter of 2022 and our obligations to HCRP expired upon Biogen’s payment of royalties for that quarter. Accordingly, we have been receiving the full benefit of royalties on net sales of Fampyra since June 2022.
 Ampyra Patent Update
 There are no patents listed in the Orange Book for Ampyra. Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents.
 There are two European patents, EP 1732548 and EP 2377536, with claims directed to use of a sustained release dalfampridine composition (known under the trade name Fampyra in the European Union) to increase walking speed in a patient with multiple sclerosis. Both European patents are set to expire in 2025, absent any additional exclusivity granted based on regulatory review timelines. Fampyra had ten years of market exclusivity in the European Union that expired in 2021. Accordingly, even though the European patents were upheld by the Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office, generic drug manufacturers may seek to challenge Fampyra’s European patents within individual European countries, and Fampyra could potentially face competition from those generic drug manufacturers. For example, a generic drug manufacturer that has sought to invalidate Fampyra patents in Germany through nullity proceedings, as described in the Legal Proceedings section of this report, has commenced a generic launch in Germany even though the patents have not been invalidated. Several other generics have been approved in Germany, one of which has commenced commercial launch, and there are also several generics that have taken steps to potentially initiate a generic launch in other European countries although the patents have not been invalidated in those jurisdictions either.
Sales, Marketing and Market Access
 Inbrija
 We market Inbrija in the U.S. using field-based teams supported by our corporate marketing personnel. Our own neuro-specialty sales representatives work in combination with sales representatives provided by a contract commercial organization, and collectively they are currently focused on a priority list of physicians who are high volume prescribers of carbidopa/levodopa and other products indicated to treat OFF episodes. Our field-based teams also include reimbursement and market access specialists, who provide information to physicians and payers on our marketed products, as well as market development specialists who work collaboratively with field-sales teams and corporate personnel to assist in the execution of our strategic initiatives. Our Inbrija field-based and marketing activities are focused on physician awareness and market access as well as patient awareness, education and training. Inbrija is distributed in the U.S. primarily through specialty pharmacies, including those associated with our e-prescribing program described below, such as AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, or Walgreens, a specialty pharmacy that delivers the medication to patients by mail; and ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc. (an Amerisource Bergen affiliate), a specialty distributor. In 2022, we implemented an e-prescribing program for the distribution of Inbrija in the U.S. through a specialty pharmacy that supports electronic prescriptions. We believe the convenience of electronic prescribing may be preferred by some physicians and patients.
 We have established Prescription Support Services for Inbrija, sometimes referred to as the Inbrija hub, which helps patients navigate their insurance coverage and identify potential financial support alternatives, when appropriate. The Inbrija hub also includes a virtual nurse educator program to assist patients with proper usage of the Inbrija inhaler. Insurance coverage services fall into one of these categories: insurance verification, to research patient insurance benefits and confirm insurance coverage; prior authorization support, to identify prior authorization requirements; and appeals support. For patients that may need assistance paying for their medication, Prescription Support Services offers several support options, including: a program that provides no cost medication to patients who meet specific program eligibility requirements; co-pay support, which may help commercially insured (non-government funded) patients lower their out-of-pocket costs; and a bridge program for federally insured patients who experience a delay in coverage determination. We have a no-cost sample program, available at physician offices, to enable patients and their physicians to assess the efficacy and tolerability of Inbrija before the patient incurs out-of-pocket co-pay or co-insurance costs. In addition, we have a first dispense zero-dollar copay program for commercially insured patients (which replaced our previous free trial program) to enable those patients to assess the value of Inbrija before incurring out-of-pocket co-pay or co-insurance costs, and we have a cash pay program allowing reduced costs for eligible cash paying patients.
 Currently, Inbrija is available in the U.S. without the need for a medical exception for approximately 92% of commercially insured lives and approximately 18% of Medicare plan lives.
 Ampyra
 We market Ampyra in the U.S. using field-based teams supported by our corporate marketing personnel. Our own neuro-specialty sales representatives work in combination with sales representatives provided by a contract commercial organization. Ampyra is distributed in the U.S. primarily through a network of specialty pharmacies, which deliver the medication to patients by mail. We have contracted with a third-party organization with extensive experience in coordinating patient benefits to run Ampyra Patient Support Services, or APSS, a dedicated resource that coordinates the prescription process among healthcare providers, people with multiple sclerosis, and insurance carriers. We have a 60-day free trial program that provides eligible patients with two months of Ampyra at no cost.
Material and Other Collaborations and License Agreements
 Alkermes (ARCUS products)
 On December 27, 2010, Civitas, our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Alkermes, Inc. pursuant to which Alkermes assigned, sold and transferred to Civitas certain of its rights in certain pulmonary delivery patents and patents applications, certain equipment and instruments relating to pulmonary drug delivery, copies of certain documents and reports relating to pulmonary delivery, certain pulmonary drug delivery inhalers and certain pulmonary drug delivery Investigational New Drug Applications, or INDs, filed with the FDA. Alkermes also granted to Civitas a non-exclusive sublicense to know-how for the purpose of development and commercialization of ARCUS products.

Civitas is permitted to license and sublicense the pulmonary patents, patent applications and know-how, subject to certain restrictions, as necessary for our business. Without the prior written consent of Alkermes, Civitas is prohibited from assigning the intellectual property acquired from Alkermes, except to an affiliate or to a person that acquires all or substantially all of its business to which the agreement relates, whether by acquisition, sale, merger or otherwise.
 Civitas is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop ARCUS products. Civitas is obligated to pay to Alkermes royalties for each licensed product. For licensed products sold by Civitas or an affiliate, Civitas will pay Alkermes a mid-single digit percentage royalty on net sales. For licensed products sold by a collaboration partner, Civitas will pay Alkermes the lower of either (1) a mid-single digit percentage royalty on collaboration partner net sales of licensed products in any given calendar year, or (2) a percentage in the low-to-mid-double digits of all collaboration partner revenue received in such calendar year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the collaboration partner royalty paid be less than a low-single digit percentage of collaboration partner net sales of the licensed product in any given calendar year.
Civitas has the right to terminate the Alkermes agreement at any time upon giving 90 days’ written notice. The Alkermes agreement may also be terminated by either party with respect to certain specified uncured breaches following notice and the expiration of a cure period.
 Subject to the termination provisions described above, the Alkermes agreement remains in effect until expiration of Civitas’ royalty obligations to Alkermes. Royalties are payable to Alkermes on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) the expiration of the patents acquired from Alkermes containing a valid claim covering a product in a particular country and (ii) 12 years and six months after the launch of a product in a country.
 Biogen (Fampyra)
 In 2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Biogen (the “Collaboration Agreement"), pursuant to which we and Biogen have agreed to collaborate on the development and commercialization of products containing aminopyridines, including Ampyra, initially directed to the treatment of multiple sclerosis, or MS, (licensed products). Under the Collaboration Agreement, Ampyra is marketed by Biogen as Fampyra outside the U.S. Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Our Fampyra patents have been challenged in Germany and could be similarly challenged in other countries where Fampyra is marketed by Biogen, and these challenges could lead to generic competition with Fampyra, which could have a material adverse effect on our royalty revenue from Biogen. See Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this report for more information.
 We have also entered into a related supply agreement with Biogen (the “Supply Agreement") concurrently with the Collaboration Agreement pursuant to which we are obligated to supply Biogen with its requirements for the licensed products. Biogen Inc., the parent of Biogen, has guaranteed the performance of Biogen's obligations under the Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Biogen, itself or through its affiliates, has the exclusive right to commercialize licensed products in all countries outside of the U.S., unless rights to a particular country terminate under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, while we retain the exclusive right to commercialize licensed products in the U.S. Each party has the exclusive right to develop licensed products for its commercialization territory, although the parties may also decide to jointly carry out mutually agreed future development activities under a cost-sharing arrangement. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we participate in overseeing the development and commercialization of Ampyra and other licensed products in markets outside the U.S. in part through our participation in joint committees with Biogen. If Biogen does not participate in the development of licensed products for certain indications or forms of administration, it may lose the right to develop and commercialize the licensed products for such indication or form of administration. Biogen may sublicense its rights to certain unaffiliated distributors. During the term of the Collaboration Agreement and for two years after the Collaboration Agreement terminates, neither party nor its affiliates may, other than pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any competing product, defined as one that contains aminopyridine or any other compound that acts at least in part through direct interaction with potassium channels to improve neurological function in MS, spinal cord injury or other demyelinating conditions, except that we may exploit the licensed products anywhere in the world following termination of the Collaboration Agreement.
 We are entitled to receive additional payments from Biogen that exceed $300 million in the aggregate based on achievement of future regulatory and sales milestones, although we do not anticipate achievement of any of those milestones in the foreseeable future.

Under our agreement with Biogen, we are entitled to receive double-digit tiered royalties on net sales of Fampyra and we are also entitled to receive additional payments based on achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones, although we do not anticipate achievement of any of those milestones in the foreseeable future. In November 2017, we announced a $40 million Fampyra royalty monetization transaction with HealthCare Royalty Partners, or HCRP. In return, HCRP obtained the right to receive these Fampyra royalties up to an agreed-upon threshold. This threshold was met during the second quarter of 2022 and our obligations to HCRP expired upon Biogen’s payment of royalties for that quarter. Accordingly, we have been receiving the full benefit of royalties on net sales of Fampyra since June 2022.
 Biogen is obligated to purchase all of Biogen's, its affiliates' and its sublicensees' requirements of the licensed products from us, unless we permit alternative sourcing of supply. In addition, Biogen pays us, in consideration for its purchase and sale of the licensed products, any amounts due to Alkermes for ex-U.S. sales, including royalties owed under the terms of any existing agreements with Alkermes. In October 2022, an arbitration panel issued a decision in our dispute with Alkermes and awarded to us approximately $18.3 million including prejudgment interest and subsequent correction of an error in calculating the initial award. In addition, as a result of the panel’s ruling, we no longer have to pay Alkermes any royalties on net sales for license and supply of Ampyra, and we are free to use alternative sources for supply of Ampyra, which we have already secured for U.S. supply. However, the arbitration panel also ruled that the existing license and supply agreements with Alkermes are unenforceable. Accordingly, absent a new supply agreement with Alkermes or another supplier, we will not be able to exclusively supply Fampyra to Biogen under the terms of our supply arrangement with them. While we have engaged in discussions with Biogen relating to the supply of Fampyra, there can be no assurance that such discussions will result in a continuation of supply by us, Alkermes or a third party manufacturer. If Biogen is unable to obtain supply of the licensed product, it could constitute a breach under the existing supply agreement with Biogen resulting in termination of the license and supply agreements with Biogen or otherwise result in the cessation of sales of Fampyra and loss of royalty revenue in the future.
The Collaboration Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of Biogen's royalty payment obligations, which occurs, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, upon the latest of expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering a licensed product, fifteen years following first commercial sale of such licensed product, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity and the existence of certain levels of sales by competing products. The Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement will automatically terminate upon the termination of our license agreement with Alkermes in its entirety or with respect to all countries outside of the U.S. While the license agreement was declared unenforceable by the arbitration panel as previously described, it has not been deemed to be terminated. Biogen may terminate the Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis at any time upon 180 days' prior written notice, subject to our right to accelerate such termination. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either party if the other party fails to cure a material breach under the agreement, which termination will be limited to a particular country or region under certain circumstances. However, if Biogen has the right to terminate the Collaboration Agreement due to our material uncured breach, Biogen may instead elect to keep the agreement in effect, but decrease the royalty rates they pay us by a specified percentage. We may also terminate the Collaboration Agreement if Biogen does not commercially launch a licensed product within a specified time period after receiving regulatory approval for such licensed product or otherwise fails to meet certain commercialization obligations. In addition, we may terminate the Collaboration Agreement under certain circumstances if (i) Biogen, its affiliates or its sublicensees challenge certain of our patents or (ii) there is a change in control of Biogen or its parent company or certain dispositions of assets by Biogen, its parent or its affiliated companies, followed by a change in the sales and marketing personnel responsible for the licensed products in Biogen's territory of more than a specified percentage within a certain period of time after such change in control or disposition. The Supply Agreement may be terminated by either party if the other party fails to cure a material breach under the Supply Agreement. In addition, the Supply Agreement will terminate automatically upon termination of the Collaboration Agreement, and the Collaboration Agreement will terminate automatically if the Supply Agreement is terminated for any reason other than for a material breach that we are responsible for. To the extent permitted by law, each party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement if the other party is subject to bankruptcy proceedings.
 If the Supply Agreement is terminated by Biogen for an uncured material breach by us, we will waive our exclusive supply right to permit Biogen to negotiate terms with Alkermes or another supplier for the supply of licensed products to Biogen. If the Supply Agreement is otherwise terminated, Biogen will not have any future obligations to purchase licensed products from us and we will not have any future obligations to supply Biogen with licensed products. If the Collaboration Agreement is terminated, Biogen will assign to us all regulatory documentation and other information necessary or useful to exploit the licensed products in the terminated countries and will grant us a license under Biogen's and its affiliates' relevant patent rights, know-how and trademarks to exploit the licensed products in the terminated countries. Such assignment and license will be at no cost to us unless the Collaboration Agreement is terminated by Biogen for a material uncured breach that

we are responsible for, in which case the parties will negotiate a payment to Biogen to reflect the net value of such assigned and licensed rights.
 Neither party may assign the agreements without the prior written consent of the other, except to an affiliate or, in certain cases, to a third-party acquirer of the party.
 In connection with the entry into the Collaboration Agreement, Biogen and Alkermes entered into a Consent Agreement with us. Under the Consent Agreement, Alkermes consented to our sublicense of rights to Biogen, and the three parties agreed to set up a committee to coordinate activities under our agreements with Alkermes with respect to the development, supply and commercialization of the licensed products for Biogen's territory. The Consent Agreement also amended our agreements with Alkermes by, among other things, permitting us to allow Biogen to grant sublicenses to certain unaffiliated distributors; permitting us to allow Biogen to package the licensed products and to work directly with Alkermes with respect to certain supply-related activities; and, requiring Alkermes to facilitate the qualification of an alternate supplier of the licensed products under certain circumstances.
 Alkermes (Ampyra)
 We have entered into agreements with Elan Corporation plc, including those described immediately below and elsewhere in this report. In September 2011, Alkermes plc acquired Elan’s Drug Technologies business and Elan transferred our agreements to Alkermes as part of that transaction. Throughout this report, references to “Alkermes” include Alkermes plc and also, as the context may require, Elan Corporation plc as the predecessor to Alkermes plc under our agreements.
 In September 2003, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Elan that replaced two prior license agreements for Ampyra in oral sustained release dosage form. Under this agreement, Elan granted us exclusive worldwide rights to Ampyra for all indications, including spinal cord injury, or SCI, multiple sclerosis, or MS, and all other indications. We agreed to pay Elan milestone payments of up to $15.0 million, of which we have reached and paid $5.0 million, and royalties based on net sales of products with dalfampridine as the active ingredient. We also agreed to pay Elan 7% of any upfront and milestone payments that we receive from the sublicensing of rights to Ampyra or other aminopyridine products.
Alkermes was also obligated to supply us with our commercial requirements for Ampyra in the U.S., as well as to supply Biogen under the Supply Agreement and Consent Agreement with Fampyra for Biogen’s clinical trials and for Biogen’s commercial requirements. However, as mentioned above, in October 2022, an arbitration panel issued a decision in our dispute with Alkermes and ruled that the existing license and supply agreements with Alkermes are unenforceable. Accordingly, absent a new supply agreement with Alkermes or another supplier, we will not be able to exclusively supply Fampyra to Biogen under the terms of our supply arrangement with them. While we have engaged in discussions with Biogen relating to the supply of Fampyra, there can be no assurance that such discussions will result in a continuation of supply by us, Alkermes or a third party manufacturer. If Biogen is unable to obtain supply of the licensed product could constitute a breach under the existing supply agreement with Biogen resulting in termination of the license and supply agreements with Biogen or otherwise result in the cessation of sales of Fampyra and loss of royalty revenue in the future.
Manufacturing and Supply
 Inbrija
 Chelsea Manufacturing Facility
 All commercial supply of Inbrija is currently manufactured at Catalent’s Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing facility, which was transferred to Catalent in February 2021 in connection with our sale to Catalent of our Chelsea manufacturing operations.
Catalent Manufacturing Services Agreement
 In connection with the sale of our Chelsea manufacturing operations to Catalent in February 2021, we entered into the 2021 MSA pursuant to which Catalent has agreed to manufacture Inbrija for us at the Chelsea facility. The 2021 MSA

provided that Catalent will manufacture Inbrija to our specifications, and we would purchase Inbrija exclusively from Catalent during the term of the agreement; provided that such exclusivity requirement would not apply to Inbrija intended for sale in China.
 Under the 2021 MSA, we agreed to purchase from Catalent at least $16 million of Inbrija in 2021 (pro-rated for a partial year) and $18 million of Inbrija each year from 2022 through 2030, subject to reduction in certain cases. In December 2021, we and Catalent amended the manufacturing services agreement to adjust the structure of the minimum payment terms for the period from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 (the “Adjustment Period”). Under the amendment, the minimum payment obligation for the Adjustment Period is replaced with payments to Catalent for actual product delivered during the Adjustment Period subject to a cap for the Adjustment Period that corresponds to our original minimum inventory purchase obligation for that period (i.e., $17 million), and with certain payments being made in the first half of 2022 instead of during the second half of 2021. As a result of the amendment, our payments to Catalent for product delivered during the Adjustment Period were approximately $8.4 million less than the $17 million minimum inventory purchase obligation for that period. Additionally, pursuant to the amendment, we agreed that we would reimburse a portion of Catalent’s costs in completing the installation and qualification of a larger size 7 spray dryer at the Chelsea manufacturing facility, which we believe will be beneficial to our future production needs, in the amount of $1.5 million.
On December 31, 2022, we terminated the 2021 MSA and entered into the New MSA effective January 1, 2023. Under the New MSA, Catalent will continue to manufacture Inbrija under a long-term manufacturing agreement under which Catalent will manufacture Inbrija on an exclusive basis (with the potential exclusion of Inbrija for sale in China) at the Chelsea manufacturing facility.
 The New MSA provides for the scale-up of a larger size 7 spray dryer (“PSD-7”) at the Chelsea manufacturing facility, which will provide expanded capacity for the long-term world-wide manufacturing requirements of Inbrija. The Company will be subject to purchase commitments of at least 15 batches on the size 4 spray dryer in 2023 and at least 24 batches on the size 4 spray dryer in 2024, at a total cost of $10.5 million and $15.5 million, respectively. Thereafter, in 2025, the Company will pay Catalent a fixed per capsule fee based on the amount of Inbrija that is delivered for sale in the United States and other markets. For China, we are not required to purchase our supply from Catalent and may arrange for an alternate supplier. For other countries, we may be released from exclusivity as long as we purchase at least two batches from Catalent in the applicable year, subject to certain rights of first refusal on alternative source supply arrangements. It is anticipated that by 2026, the PSD-7 equipment will be fully operational, which will significantly reduce the per capsule fees for all markets. The Company has agreed to a minimum purchase requirement of at least three batches per year on the PSD-7 equipment. In addition, the Company will pay Catalent $2 million in 2023 in connection with certain activities relating to the operational readiness of the PSD-7 and will provide up to $1 million in each of 2023 and 2024 for capital expenditures to assist in the capacity expansion efforts at the Chelsea manufacturing facility.
The New MSA, unless earlier terminated, will continue until December 31, 2030, and will be automatically extended for successive two-year periods unless either the Company or Catalent provides the other with at least 18-months’ prior written notice of non-renewal. Either party may terminate the New MSA by written notice under certain circumstances, including material breach (subject to specified cure periods) or insolvency. The Company may also terminate the New MSA upon certain specified regulatory events and for convenience upon 180 days’ prior written notice.
The Company agreed to purchase from Catalent all of its requirements for Inbrija for the United States, Germany, Spain and Latin America except in the case of termination or certain supply disruptions. For China, the Company is not required to purchase its supply from Catalent and may arrange for an alternate supplier. For other countries, the Company may be released from exclusivity as long as it purchases at least two batches from Catalent in the applicable year, subject to certain rights of first refusal on alternative source of supply arrangements.
 The New MSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including with respect to the ownership of any intellectual property created pursuant to the manufacturing services agreement, as well as provisions relating to ordering, payment and shipping terms, regulatory matters, reporting obligations, indemnity, confidentiality and other matters.
 We are discussing potential ARCUS collaborations with other companies that have expressed interest in formulating their novel molecules using ARCUS, and have already performed feasibility studies for a number of these opportunities. However, currently we are not investing in any proprietary ARCUS research and development programs. Should we decide to proceed with any ARCUS development program, we would be reliant on Catalent or another third-party supplier for the manufacture of product for that program. The New MSA does not provide for the terms and conditions under which Catalent would supply any product or product candidate other than Inbrija, or under which Catalent would provide support for

ARCUS research and development. We would be unable to advance the development of any ARCUS inhaled therapeutic candidate unless Catalent is willing to manufacture the candidate for us on commercially reasonable terms, or we could identify another third-party manufacturer that would be capable and willing to manufacture the candidate for us on commercially reasonable terms. Also, due to reductions in force, employee attrition and the 2021 sale of our Chelsea manufacturing operations, we may need to hire replacement personnel or engage consultants to continue with ARCUS research and development work beyond feasibility and similar early-stage studies.
 Supply of Inbrija Components
 Catalent, as our Inbrija blistered capsule supplier, is responsible for all Inbrija components other than certain packaging components, the inhaler device and levodopa, or L-dopa, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in Inbrija. Although in some cases we have contracts for these requirements, we cannot be certain that those contracts will be renewed on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We do not have contracts with the supplier of the API used in the manufacture of Inbrija, which exposes us to the risk that they could discontinue supply at any time. Manufacturers, packagers or suppliers may choose not to conduct business with us at all, or may choose to discontinue doing business with us, for example if they determine that our particular business requirements would be unprofitable or otherwise not appropriate for their business.
We do not control how Catalent sources the other components of Inbrija, but we are aware that they rely on a single supplier for a critical excipient used for Inbrija manufacturing and they could rely on single suppliers for other components. Our business could similarly be exposed to risk to the extent they rely on single source suppliers or do not have supply contracts.
 Our proprietary Inbrija inhalers are manufactured using standard manufacturing processes and are shipped fully assembled to us. We own the molds and design history files for the inhalers. We currently source our proprietary Inbrija inhalers from a single third-party plastic molding manufacturer for the Inbrija inhalers. Our reliance on a single third party for the manufacture of inhalers increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our inhalers or will not be able to obtain such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could harm our commercialization of Inbrija. If the inhaler supplier fails to provide sufficient inhaler supply, we would need enter into alternative arrangements with a different suppler. Transition to a new inhaler supplier would be a lengthy and complex process. Among other things, we would have to revalidate the molding and assembly processes pursuant to FDA requirements and we would have to ensure that inhalers manufactured by the new supplier adhere to other applicable regulatory requirements.
 Ampyra
 In October 2022, an arbitration panel issued a decision in our dispute with Alkermes and ruled that the existing license and supply agreements with Alkermes are unenforceable. As a result of the panel’s ruling, we no longer have to pay Alkermes any royalties on net sales for license and supply of Ampyra, and we are free to use alternative sources for supply of Ampyra, which we have already secured for U.S. supply.
We had previously designated Patheon, Inc. as a second manufacturing source of Ampyra. In connection with that designation, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Patheon, and Alkermes assisted us in transferring manufacturing technology to Patheon. Patheon now supplies us with our Ampyra needs.
 On September 30, 2010, we entered into a world-wide manufacturing services agreement with Patheon, Inc. as a second manufacturer for Ampyra (Dalfampridine-ER tablets, 10mg). Under the manufacturing services agreement, we agreed to purchase from Patheon, on a non-exclusive basis, a portion of our requirements for Ampyra in the United States. The Company pays Patheon a fixed per bottle fee (60 tablets per bottle) based on the annual quantity of Ampyra bottles that are delivered for sale. As a result of the arbitration ruling in October 2022, we were free to obtain supply of Ampyra from alternative sources and Patheon became our sole manufacturer and packager of Ampyra for sales in the United States.
 The manufacturing services agreement is automatically renewed for successive one-year periods on December 31 of each year, unless either we or Patheon provide the other party with at least 12-months’ prior written notice of non-renewal. Either party may terminate manufacturing services agreement by written notice under certain circumstances, including material breach (subject to specified cure periods) or insolvency. We may also terminate the manufacturing services agreement upon certain regulatory actions or objections. Patheon may terminate the manufacturing services agreement if we assign the agreement to a third party under certain circumstances.


The manufacturing services agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including with respect to the ownership of any intellectual property created pursuant to the manufacturing services agreement, as well as provisions relating to ordering, payment and shipping terms, regulatory matters, reporting obligations, indemnity, confidentiality and other matters.
 We rely on a single third-party manufacturer to supply dalfampridine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in Ampyra, and also on a single supplier for a critical excipient used in the manufacture of Ampyra. If these companies experience any disruption in their operations, our supply of Ampyra could be delayed or interrupted until the problem is solved or we locate another source of supply or another packager, which may not be available. We may not be able to enter into alternative supply or packaging arrangements on terms that are commercially reasonable, if at all. Any new supplier or packager would also be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements. Because of these and other factors, we could experience substantial delays before we are able to obtain qualified replacement products or services from any new supplier or packager.
 Intellectual Property
 We have patent portfolios relating to: Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder); Ampyra/aminopyridines; and the ARCUS drug delivery technology. Our intellectual property also includes copyrights, confidential and trade secret information as well as a portfolio of trademarks.
 The intellectual property relating to our programs is owned directly by Acorda or indirectly through a subsidiary, including for example our Civitas subsidiary. Throughout this report, we may refer to any and all such intellectual property, and the corresponding research and development programs as, “our” or “Acorda’s” programs.
 Inbrija and ARCUS Development Programs
The intellectual property portfolio that we acquired with Civitas has U.S. and foreign patents relating to Inbrija and the ARCUS drug delivery technology, including several issued U.S. patents relating to Inbrija directed to compositions of the drug product and the capsule for the drug product. We have several patents listed in the Orange Book for Inbrija, including patents expiring between 2024 and 2032. Inbrija was also entitled to three years of new product exclusivity, but this expired in December 2021. We have patents in Europe for Inbrija expiring in 2033. One of our European patents, EP 3090773B, had been opposed by an unnamed party but in 2021 was maintained as granted by the European Opposition Board. Inbrija also has ten years of market exclusivity in Europe that will expire in September 2029.
 Ampyra/aminopyridines
There are no patents listed in the Orange Book for Ampyra. Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents.
 There are two European patents, EP 1732548 and EP 2377536, with claims directed to use of a sustained release dalfampridine composition (known under the trade name Fampyra in the European Union) to increase walking speed in a patient with multiple sclerosis. Both European patents are set to expire in 2025, absent any additional exclusivity granted based on regulatory review timelines. Fampyra had ten years of market exclusivity in the European Union that expired in 2021. Accordingly, even though the European patents were upheld by the Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office, Fampyra could potentially face competition from generic drug manufacturers that may seek to challenge Fampyra’s European patents within individual European countries.
Nullity actions with respect to Fampyra have been filed in Germany against both of the German national patents derived from EP 1732548 (the ‘548 patent) and EP 2377536 (the ‘536 patent) by ratiopharm GmbH, a generic manufacturer affiliated with Teva. In November 2021, a court issued preliminary opinions in the ratiopharm case indicating that the claimed subject matter of the ‘548 patent lacked inventive step and the claimed subject matter of the ‘536 patent lacked novelty and inventive step. At oral hearings in February 2022 and April 2022, the German Patent Court dismissed ratiopharm’s action against the ‘536 patent and the ‘548 patent, respectively, as inadmissible because of ongoing formality proceedings relating to these patents in the European Patent Office. Ratiopharm has appealed the decision on the ‘536 patent but not the decision on the ‘548 patent, and could refile the nullity actions. On December 6, 2022, the German Federal Court of Justice held that ratiopharm’s ‘536 nullity action was admissible and remanded the case back to the German Federal Patent

Court. On January 11, 2022, Stada Arzneimittel also filed a nullity action against the ‘536 patent, and on July 27, 2022, Teva GmbH also filed a nullity action against the ‘548 patent, both in the same court as the ratiopharm nullity actions. On January 27, 2023, the German Federal Patent Court issued a preliminary opinion in the ‘548 Teva nullity action that the claimed subject matter of the ‘548 patent lacked inventive step and scheduled a hearing for July 11, 2023. We are working with Biogen to vigorously defend these actions and enforce our patent rights. See Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this report for more information.
 
Trademarks
 In addition to patents, our intellectual property portfolio includes registered trademarks, along with pending trademark applications. We own several registered trademarks in the U.S. and in other countries. These registered trademarks include, in the U.S., the marks “Acorda Therapeutics,” our stylized Acorda Therapeutics logo, “Biotie Therapies,” “Ampyra,” “Inbrija,” and “ARCUS.” We also have trademark registrations for “Fampyra” and “Inbrija” and pending trademark applications therefore, in numerous foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our trademark portfolio includes several trademark registrations and pending trademark applications for potential product names and for disease awareness activities.
Competition
 The market for developing and marketing pharmaceutical products is highly competitive. Many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, are engaged in research, development and/or marketing of therapeutics for various neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development, human and other resources than we do. Furthermore, many of these companies have significantly more experience than we do in preclinical testing, human clinical trials, regulatory approval procedures and sales and marketing.
 Inbrija/Parkinson’s Disease
 Inbrija competes against other therapies approved for intermittent, or as needed, use that aim to specifically address Parkinson’s disease symptoms. Apokyn, an injectable formulation of apomorphine, is approved for the treatment of OFF episodes, also known as OFF periods. Apokyn was approved for this use in the U.S. in 2004 and in Europe in 1993, and in 2022 the FDA approved a generic version of Apokyn. Also, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. markets a sublingual, or under the tongue, formulation of apomorphine branded as Kynmobi, approved in May 2020, that is competitive with Inbrija.
 The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease is oral carbidopa/levodopa, but oral medication can be associated with wide variability in the timing and the amount of absorption and there are significant challenges in creating a regimen that consistently maintains therapeutic effects as Parkinson’s disease progresses. Inbrija may face competition from therapies that can limit the occurrence of OFF periods. Approaches to achieve consistent levodopa plasma concentrations include new formulations of carbidopa/levodopa, such as extended-release and intestinal infusions, and therapies that prolong the effect of levodopa. Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. markets RYTARY, an extended-release formulation of oral carbidopa/levodopa, and extended-release formulations of oral and patch carbidopa/levodopa are being developed by others including Intec Pharma and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation. Also, AbbVie Inc. has developed a continuous administration of a gel-containing levodopa through a tube that is surgically implanted into the intestine. This therapy, known as Duopa, has been approved by the FDA and is approved in the EU.
 One or more of our competitors may utilize their expertise in pulmonary delivery of drugs to develop and obtain approval for pulmonary delivery products that may compete with Inbrija and any other ARCUS drug delivery technology product candidates that we may develop in the future. These competitors may include smaller companies such as Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pulmatrix, Inc. and Vectura Group plc and larger companies such as Allergan, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, MannKind Corporation, and Novartis AG, among others. If approved, our product candidates may face competition in the target commercial areas for these pulmonary delivery products. Also, we are aware that at least one company, Impel Neuropharma, is developing intranasally delivered levodopa therapies which, if approved, might compete with Inbrija.
 Ampyra/MS
 Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents. We have experienced a

significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from several generic versions of Ampyra. Additional manufacturers may market generic versions of Ampyra, and we expect our Ampyra sales will continue to decline over time.
 Current disease management approaches to MS are classified either as relapse management, disease course management, or symptom management approaches. For relapse management, the majority of neurologists treat sudden and severe relapses with a four-day course of intravenous high-dose corticosteroids. Many of these corticosteroids are available generically. For disease course management, there are a number of FDA-approved MS therapies that seek to modify the immune system. These treatments attempt to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations or slow the accumulation of physical disability for people with certain types of MS, though their precise mechanisms of action are not known. These products include Avonex, Tysabri, Plegridy and Tecfidera from Biogen, Zinbryta from Biogen and AbbVie, Betaseron from Bayer AG, Copaxone from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Rebif from Merck Serono, Gilenya and Extavia from Novartis AG, Aubagio and Lemtrada from Genzyme Corporation (a Sanofi company), Glatopa from Sandoz International GmbH (a Novartis AG company), Rituxan from F. Hoffman-La Roche AG, Ponvory from Janssen (a Johnson & Johnson company), and Zeposia from Bristol-MyersSquibb.
 Several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, are involved in research and/or product development for various neurological diseases, including MS. Other companies also have products in clinical development, including products approved for other indications in MS, to address improvement of walking ability in people with MS. This potential product may compete with Ampyra in the future. Furthermore, several companies are engaged in developing products that include novel immune system approaches and cell therapy approaches to remyelination for the treatment of people with MS. These programs are in early stages of development and may compete in the future with Ampyra or some of our product candidates. In addition, in certain circumstances, pharmacists are not prohibited from formulating certain drug compounds to fill prescriptions on an individual patient basis, which is referred to as compounding. We are aware that at present compounded dalfampridine is used by some people with MS and it is possible that some people will want to continue to use compounded formulations even though Ampyra and generic versions of Ampyra are commercially available.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the preclinical testing, clinical development, manufacture, distribution and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, sale, promotion, import and export of our products and product candidates. The discussion below covers FDA regulation of drugs and drug product approval. We currently do not have any active development programs for new potential drug products, however we continue to discuss potential collaborations with other companies that express interest in formulating their novel molecules for pulmonary delivery using ARCUS, and have already been performing feasibility studies for a number of these opportunities.
 FDA Regulation of Drugs and Drug Product Approval
In the U.S., Ampyra is regulated by the FDA as a drug but, as further discussed below, Inbrija is regulated as a combination product because it has both a drug and a device component. Drugs, biologics, and medical devices are regulated primarily under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and the regulations of the FDA. These products are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage of development may result in various adverse consequences, including the FDA's and other health authorities' delay in approving or refusal to approve a product. Violations of regulatory requirements also may result in enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, labeling restrictions, seizure of products, fines, injunctions and/or civil or criminal penalties. Similar civil or criminal penalties could be imposed by other government agencies or agencies of the states and localities in which our products are tested, manufactured, sold or distributed.
 The process required by the FDA under these laws before drug and biological product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 •preclinical laboratory and animal tests;


•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biologic, for each intended use;
 •FDA review of whether each facility in which the product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product's identity, strength, quality, and purity; and
 •submission and FDA approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, in the case of a drug, or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, in the case of a biologic, containing preclinical and clinical data, proposed labeling, information to demonstrate that the product will be manufactured to appropriate standards, and other required information.
 The research, development and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely or commercially viable basis, if at all, for any product that we or our collaborators may be developing.
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of a product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its safety and potential efficacy. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, and any available clinical data or literature must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The IND sponsor may initiate clinical trials 30 days after filing the IND application, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial, which FDA commonly communicates to the IND sponsor through a clinical hold letter. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, charged with protecting the welfare of human subjects involved in research at each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trials must review and approve any clinical trial before it commences at that center. The IRB(s) must continue to monitor the trial until its completion. Many studies also employ a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, with experts who are otherwise independent of the conduct of the study and are given access to the unblinded study data periodically during the study to determine whether the study should be halted. For example, a DSMB might halt a study if an unacceptable safety issue emerges, or if the data showing the effectiveness of the study drug would make it unethical to continue giving patients placebo. Study subjects must provide informed consent before their participation in the research study. Once initiated, the FDA may also place an ongoing clinical study on a clinical hold, which must be resolved before the study may continue.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap:
 •Phase 1. The drug is initially administered into healthy human subjects or subjects with the target condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion.
 •Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 •Phase 3. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the drug is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to confirm the clinical efficacy from Phase 2 and to further test for safety in an expanded population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
 In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in affected patients rather than in healthy volunteers. Since these patients already have the target condition, these clinical trials may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase 2 clinical trials and thus these clinical trials are frequently referred to as Phase 1b clinical trials.
 Before proceeding with a Phase 3 trial, sponsors may seek a written agreement from the FDA regarding the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim. This is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. SPAs help establish up-front agreement with the FDA about the adequacy of the design of a clinical trial, but the agreement does not guarantee FDA approval even if the SPA is followed. For example, a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug could be identified after the testing has begun. In addition, even if a SPA remains in place and the trial meets its endpoints with statistical significance, the FDA could

determine that the overall balance of risks and benefits for the product candidate is not adequate to support approval, or only justifies approval for a narrow set of clinical uses or approval with restricted distribution or other burdensome post-approval requirements or limitations.
 Federal law requires the submission of registry and results information for most clinical trials to a publicly available database at www.clinicaltrials.gov. These requirements generally do not apply to Phase 1 clinical trials.
 U.S. law requires that trials conducted to support approval for product marketing be "adequate and well controlled." This entails a number of requirements, including that there is a clear statement of objectives and methods in the clinical trial protocol, the study design permits a valid comparison with a control (e.g., a placebo, another drug already approved for the studied condition, or a non-concurrent control such as historical data), and that the statistical methods used to analyze the data are adequate to assess the effects of the drug. Studies must also be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements.
 We cannot be certain that we or our collaborators will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing of any product candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRBs or the DSMB may prevent clinical trials from beginning or may place clinical trials on hold or terminate them at any point in the development process if, among other reasons, they conclude that study subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 In the U.S., for most drugs and biologics, the results of product development, preclinical studies, and clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA for review and approval prior to marketing and commercial distribution of the product candidate. If the product candidate is regulated as a drug, an NDA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. If the product candidate, such as an antibody, is regulated as a biologic, a BLA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. The NDA or BLA must include a substantial amount of data and other information concerning safety and effectiveness (for a drug) and safety, purity and potency (for a biologic) of the compound from laboratory, animal and clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product stability, and proposed product labeling.
 Each domestic and foreign manufacturing establishment, including any contract manufacturers we or our collaborators may decide to use, must be listed in the NDA or BLA and must be registered with the FDA. The application will not be approved until the FDA conducts a manufacturing inspection, approves the applicable manufacturing process for the drug or biological product, and determines that the facility is in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements. If relevant manufacturing facilities and processes fail to pass FDA inspection, we or our collaborator will not receive approval to market the products, or approval will likely be delayed until the manufacturing issues are resolved. The FDA may also inspect clinical trial sites and/or the clinical trial sponsor for compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that one or more of our clinical trials were not conducted in accordance with GCP, the agency may determine not to consider effectiveness data generated from such clinical trials in support of our applications for marketing approval.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA receives fees for reviewing an NDA or BLA and supplements thereto, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products. These fees could be significant.
 Once an NDA or BLA is submitted for FDA approval, the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing if deemed complete, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established performance goals for the review of NDAs and BLAs: six months for priority applications and 10 months for regular applications, with two additional months added to each period for new molecular entities. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods and these performance goals may change over time. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if favorable, often is not an actual approval but an “action letter” or “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. This additional work could include substantial additional clinical trials. The FDA's review of an application may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee.
 The FDA may deny an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If the FDA approves a product, it will limit the approved therapeutic uses for the product as described in the product labeling, may require that contraindications or warning statements be prominently highlighted in the product labeling such as in a black box or comparable prominent format, may require that additional post-approval studies or clinical trials be conducted as a condition of the approval, may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution,

prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or may otherwise limit the scope of any approval. Under a REMS, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on distribution and use of a marketed product, may require the distribution of medication guides to patients and/or healthcare professionals or patient communication plans, and may impose a timetable for submission of assessments of the effectiveness of a REMS. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
 Satisfaction of the above FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically take several years or more and the actual time required may vary substantially, based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time or permanently and impose costly procedures upon our activities. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval will be limited to the specific approved indications. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, labeling changes, or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain and maintain, regulatory approvals for our products and any product candidates we or our collaborators may seek to develop would harm our business. Marketing products abroad requires similar regulatory approvals, additional fees and are subject to similar risks. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
 Post-Approval Regulation in the U.S.
 Any products manufactured or distributed in the U.S. by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements relating to record-keeping, labeling, packaging, reporting of adverse experiences and other reporting, advertising and promotion, distribution, cGMPs, and import/export, as well as any other requirements imposed by the NDA or BLA. The FDA's rules for advertising and promotion require, among other things, that our promotion be truthful, fairly balanced and adequately substantiated, and that our labeling bears adequate directions for all intended uses of the product. We must also submit appropriate new and supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to an approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. On its own initiative, the FDA may require changes to the labeling of an approved drug, require post-approval studies or clinical trials, or impose a REMS post-approval if it becomes aware of new safety information that the agency believes impacts the drug’s safety profile. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Foreign drug manufacturers must comply with similar FDA and local requirements and may be subject to inspections by the FDA or local regulatory agencies. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with cGMPs and other regulatory requirements. The FDA also enforces the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians.
 In addition to inspections related to manufacturing, we are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities related to the other regulatory requirements that apply to marketed drugs manufactured or distributed by us. The FDA also may conduct periodic inspections regarding our review and reporting of adverse events, or related to compliance with the requirements of the PDMA concerning the handling of drug samples. When the FDA conducts an inspection, the inspectors will identify any deficiencies they believe exist in the form of a notice of inspectional observations on FDA Form 483. The observations may be more or less significant. If we receive a notice of inspectional observations, we likely will be required to respond in writing, and may be required to undertake corrective and preventive actions in order to address the FDA's concerns. Failure to address the FDA’s concerns may result in the issuance of a warning letter or other enforcement or administrative actions against us and/or against any products we are manufacturing or distributing.
 We are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where products or product candidates are or will be marketed, or where we have operations. For example, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in that state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Federal law and some states also impose requirements on manufacturers, distributors, and other trading partners that govern the introduction and movement of product through the supply chain, including requirements for the exchange of transaction documentation, development of systems capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain, and responding to requests from trading partners and government agencies. Any

applicable federal, state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market, or increase the cost of marketing, our products in those states or localities.
 The FDA's policies may change and additional U.S. or foreign government laws and/or regulations may be enacted which could impose additional burdens or limitations on our ability to obtain approval of our product candidates or market our products after approval. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of healthcare costs in the U.S. and in foreign markets could result in government scrutiny or new regulations that could harm our business. For example, significant price increases in recent years by certain drug manufacturers have received considerable scrutiny from the U.S. Congress, in some cases forcing those companies to dramatically reduce those prices. The current U.S. administration has indicated an interest in measures designed to lower drug costs and there continues to be political pressure at both the U.S. federal and state levels related to drug pricing and drug transparency that could result in legislative or administrative actions, or at a minimum continued scrutiny. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 Generic Drugs, AB Ratings and Pharmacy Substitution
 Generic drugs are approved through an abbreviated regulatory process, which differs in important ways from the process followed for innovative products. For generic versions of drugs subject to an NDA, an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, is filed with the FDA. The ANDA must seek approval of a product candidate that has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use (labeling) as a so-called "reference listed drug" or RLD that has already been approved pursuant to a full NDA. Only limited exceptions exist to this ANDA sameness requirement, including certain limited variations approved by the FDA through a special suitability petition process. ANDA applicants are not required to submit clinical data to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Instead, the FDA relies on its prior finding of safety and effectiveness of the RLD to approve the ANDA. As a result, the law requires that the ANDA applicant submit only limited clinical data to demonstrate that the product covered by the ANDA is absorbed in the body at a rate and extent consistent with that of the RLD. This is known as bioequivalence, which commonly is shown in a bioequivalence study that typically is performed in healthy volunteers and generally is considerably less time-consuming and expensive than clinical studies in patients. In addition, the ANDA must contain information regarding the manufacturing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality. It also must contain certifications with respect to all patents that are listed for the RLD in the FDA’s publication, “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” commonly known as the “Orange Book.”
 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, drugs that are new chemicals entities, or NCEs, are eligible for a five-year data exclusivity period. During this period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA submitted by another company that relies on any of the data submitted by the innovator company. This exclusivity period also applies to “505(b)(2)” applications, which are hybrid applications that rely in-part on pioneer data and in-part on new clinical data submitted to account for differences between the 505(b)(2) product and the RLD (i.e., the innovator NDA). ANDA applicants and 505(b)(2) applicants must certify to all patents listed in the Orange Book for the RLD. An ANDA (or 505(b)(2) application) may be submitted to FDA after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of those listed patents. The statute also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA (or NDA supplement) that is not an NCE if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed essential to approval. During this period, the FDA will not approve an application filed by a third party for the protected conditions of use that relies on any of the data that was submitted by the innovator company. Neither exclusivity period blocks the approval of full applications (i.e., full NDAs) submitted to the FDA because full NDAs do not rely on a pioneer’s data.
 Special procedures apply when an ANDA contains one or more certifications stating that a listed patent is invalid or not infringed. This is known as a “Paragraph IV” certification. If the owner of the patent or the NDA for the RLD brings a patent infringement suit within a specified time after receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, an automatic stay bars FDA approval of the ANDA for 30 months, which period may be extended under certain circumstances. The length of the automatic stay depends on whether the FDA classifies the RLD as an NCE, as follows:
 •If the FDA does not classify the RLD as an NCE, then the automatic stay is for 30 months from the date that the sponsor of the RLD receives the patent certification described above.
 •If the RLD is classified by the FDA as an NCE, then the length of the automatic stay depends on when the ANDA is filed. No company can file an ANDA on a reference listed drug that the FDA has designated as an NCE until five years after the RLD's FDA approval, except that an ANDA may be submitted four years after the 


RLD’s FDA approval if the ANDA contains a Paragraph IV patent certification. If an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification is filed five or more years after FDA approval of the NCE, then the stay duration is 30 months. However, if an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification is filed in between the fourth and fifth years after FDA approval of the NCE, the automatic 30-month stay is extended by a number of months equal to the number of months remaining in the fifth year after approval of the RLD, providing a total of up to a 42 month stay.
 If the stay is either lifted or expires and the FDA approves the ANDA, the generic manufacturer may decide to begin selling its product even if patent litigation is pending unless the court enjoins their launch. However, in the absence of an injunction, if the generic manufacturer launches before patent litigation is resolved, the launch is at the risk of the generic manufacturer being later held liable for patent infringement damages.
 Most states require or permit pharmacists to substitute generic equivalents for brand-name prescriptions unless the physician has prohibited substitution. Managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers often urge physicians to prescribe drugs with generic equivalents, and to authorize substitution, as a means of controlling costs of prescriptions. They also may require lower copayments for generics as an incentive to patients to ask for and accept generics.
 While the question of substitutability is one of state law, most states look to the FDA to determine whether a generic is substitutable. The FDA lists therapeutic equivalence ratings in the “Orange Book.” In general, a generic drug that is listed in the Orange Book as therapeutically equivalent to the branded product will be substitutable under state law and, conversely, a generic drug that is not so listed generally will not be substitutable. Drug products that the FDA considers to be therapeutically equivalent to other drug products receive one of various types of “A” ratings. For example, solid oral dosage form drug products that are considered therapeutically equivalent are generally rated “AB” in the Orange Book, while therapeutically equivalent solutions and powders for aerosolization generally receive an “AB” or an “AN” rating depending on how bioequivalence was demonstrated.
 To be considered therapeutically equivalent, a generic drug must first be a pharmaceutical equivalent of the branded drug. This means that the generic has the same active ingredient, dosage form, strength or concentration, and route of administration as the branded drug. Tablets and capsules are currently considered different dosage forms that are pharmaceutical alternatives and therefore are not substitutable pharmaceutical equivalents. In addition to being pharmaceutical equivalents, therapeutic equivalents must be bioequivalent to their branded counterparts. Bioequivalence for this purpose is defined in the same manner as for ANDA approvals, and usually requires a showing of comparable rate and extent of absorption in a small study in healthy volunteers.
 The process described above is not applicable to drugs where the pioneer product was approved pursuant to a BLA, rather than an NDA. A separate process exists for follow-on versions of such products and is discussed in the section entitled “Biosimilars,” below.
 Requirements Applicable to Medical Devices in the United States
 The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, effectiveness, storage, record keeping, marketing, import, export, and distribution of medical devices. The level of regulation applied by the FDA generally depends on the class into which the medical device falls: Class I, II, or III. Class I medical devices present the lowest risk, and Class III medical devices present the highest risk. In general, the higher the class of device, the greater the degree of regulatory control. All devices, for example, are subject to “General Controls,” which include:
 •Establishment registration by manufacturers, distributors, re-packagers, and re-labelers;
 •Device listing with FDA;
 •Good manufacturing practices;
 •Labeling regulations; and
 •Reporting of adverse events.


Class II medical devices are subject to General Controls, but also Special Controls, including special labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, additional post market surveillance, and specific FDA guidance. Most Class III medical devices are assessed individually through an extensive Premarket Review application, or PMA. As a result, although they are subject to General Controls, they generally are not subject to Special Controls. Instead, most Class III devices have additional requirements and conditions of use imposed on them through the individualized PMA review and approval process.
 Although we do not manufacture or market stand-alone medical devices, Inbrija relies on a device component (the inhaler) to deliver drug product to patients. In general, the FDA regulates that type of product as a “combination product.” The FDA assigns combination products for primary or lead review by the drug or device center based on a determination of the product’s “primary mode of action.” If the FDA determines that the product achieves its therapeutic effect through the drug component, as was the case with Inbrija, it will be assigned to the Center for Drugs (CDER) or the Center for Biologics (CBER) for review and approval. By contrast, if the FDA determines that the device component is the primary mode of action, then the product will be reviewed and approved by the center for devices (CDRH). CDER is the lead review division for Inbrija. We anticipate that, to the extent that any of the other products we may develop are regulated as combination products, the FDA likely will find that the primary mode of action is through the drug component, and therefore the product will be reviewed by CDER. In that case, however, CDER/CBER will consult with CDRH on the device component and we will still have to comply with certain requirements applicable to medical devices.
 Most Class I devices are exempt from the FDA premarket review or approval process. With some exceptions, Class II devices may be marketed only if the FDA “clears” the medical device through the 510(k) process, which requires a company to show that the device is “substantially equivalent” to certain devices already on the market. Again, with some exceptions, Class III devices are approved through a PMA, which generally requires an applicant to submit data from clinical trials that establish the safety and effectiveness of the device. Clinical data are sometimes required for a 510(k) application as well. Manufacturers conducting clinical trials with medical devices are subject to similar requirements as those conducting clinical trials with drugs or biologics. For example, a manufacturer must obtain an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to test a significant risk device in humans, must comply with GCPs, and must obtain IRB approval. Although Inbrija includes a medical device component (the inhaler), Inbrija is a combination product that was approved by CDER via an NDA in consultation with CDRH, and these separate medical device clearance/approval requirements are not applicable to Inbrija.
 The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers with respect to medical devices, similar to those for drugs and biologics. For example, medical devices are subject to detailed manufacturing standards under the FDA’s quality systems regulations, or QSRs, and specific rules regarding labeling and promotion and reporting of adverse events. Medical device manufacturers must also register their establishments and list their products with the FDA.
 States also impose regulatory requirements on medical device manufacturers and distributors, including registration and record-keeping requirements. Failure to comply with the applicable federal and state medical device requirements could result in, among other things, refusal to approve or clear pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or clearance, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or other civil or criminal penalties.
 Biosimilars
 The Affordable Care Act amended the Public Health Service Act to authorize the FDA to approve “biosimilars” (follow-on versions of pioneer biological products approved pursuant to a BLA) via a separate, abbreviated pathway. Under this abbreviated pathway, the biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that its product is “highly similar” to the “reference product,” and that there are no “clinically meaningful differences” between the biosimilar and the reference product. Unlike ANDAs, biosimilars are not, in general, automatically substitutable for the reference product at the pharmacy. Instead, the FDA must make a separate finding of “interchangeability.” To date, the trend in state law has been to permit or require substitution only of those biosimilars that have also been deemed by the FDA to be interchangeable.
 The Affordable Care Act also established a period of 12 years of data exclusivity against biosimilars for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation. Under this framework, data exclusivity protects the data in the BLA-holders’ regulatory application by prohibiting others, for a period of 12 years, from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the reference product’s data in its approved BLA. In contrast to the provisions for NDAs, the biologics data exclusivity provisions do not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products, or otherwise create an “automatic stay” of FDA approval of a biosimilar. If we develop any product candidates that are approved as biologics under BLAs, they may face significant competition from biosimilars in the future.


Foreign Regulation and Product Approval
 Outside the U.S., our ability or the ability of one of our collaborators or distributors to market a product candidate is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement can vary widely from country to country. The foreign regulatory approval process involves risks very similar to those associated with FDA approval discussed above, and there are fees associated with filing the Marketing Application as well as additional fees for submissions throughout the life cycle of the product.
 Within the European Union, or EU, it is possible to obtain marketing authorizations that enable an approved product to be marketed in the entire European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the EU member states plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. This can be through the “centralized procedure” which is mandatory for certain products, including biotechnology and advanced therapy medicinal products, orphan medicines and new active substances for the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer, neurodegenerative disorder, diabetes, auto-immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. Alternatively, marketing authorizations can be obtained through the “mutual recognition” or “decentralized” procedure, which provides for the approval of a product by one or more member states based on an assessment of an application review performed by one or more other member states. The foreign regulatory approval process involves risks very similar to those associated with FDA approval discussed above.
 On September 19, 2019, the European Commission granted a marketing authorization to Inbrija, for the intermittent treatment of episodic motor fluctuations (OFF episodes) in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease treated with a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor. This marketing authorization was granted through the centralized procedure and is therefore valid throughout the EEA. The marketing authorization is valid for five years and once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period thereafter. If a product approved under the centralized procedure is not marketed in at least one EU member state within three years of the grant of the marketing authorization, the marketing authorization lapses under the EU’s sunset rules unless the deadline is extended. In December 2021, we received an extension of the sunset deadline for Inbrija to March 31, 2023. We have entered into distribution agreements with Esteve Pharmaceuticals to commercialize Inbrija in Germany and Spain, respectively. Esteve launched Inbrija in Germany in June 2022 and launched in Spain in February 2023.
 In the EU, innovator products approved on the basis of a complete and independent data package are usually entitled to a total of ten years of regulatory exclusivity from the date of first approval. For a period of eight years, EU authorities may not accept marketing authorization applications that rely on the safety and efficacy data contained in the marketing authorization dossier of the innovator product. At the end of that period, generic applicants may file and authorities may review such applications. The innovator product is protected by a further two years of market exclusivity before any generic product may launch, such that the innovator product benefits from total regulatory exclusivity period of ten years. The market exclusivity period may be extended by a further one year if, during the first eight years after a grant of marketing authorization, a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is authorized.
 Inbrija received its EU marketing authorization on the basis of a complete and independent data package and therefore benefits from the 10-year regulatory exclusivity period described above (i.e., eight years of data exclusivity plus two additional years of market exclusivity).
 The fact that a product benefits from regulatory exclusivity does not prevent competitors from obtaining a marketing authorization based on their own independently generated data. EU regulatory authorities have stated that they consider levodopa, which is the active substance contained in Inbrija, to be a “known active substance.” In principle, this means that generic competitors could – during Inbrija’s regulatory exclusivity period – file and receive a marketing authorization referring, for example, to data from the dossiers of older, established products containing levodopa, supplemented with other data that the competitor generates itself (e.g., demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the inhaled dosage form).
 As the marketing authorization holder for Inbrija in the EU, we are required to comply with a number of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal products. In particular, a marketing authorization holder’s obligations include complying with the EU’s pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules. All marketing authorizations include a Risk Mitigation Plan, or RMP, describing the risk mitigation measures that a marketing authorization holder must put in place, including post-authorization obligations such as additional safety monitoring or the conduct of post-authorization safety studies. RMPs are intended to be updated throughout the lifetime of a medicine, and marketing authorization holders are expected to submit updated RMPs as new information becomes available or at the request of EU regulatory authorities.


Other regulatory requirements relate, for example, to the manufacturing of products and active pharmaceutical ingredients in accordance with good manufacturing practice standards. The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for coordinating inspections conducted by member state competent authorities to verify compliance with various aspects of the EU’s medicines rules. In respect of inspecting manufacturing sites, in July 2019 the EU and U.S. implemented a mutual recognition agreement, or MRA, under which EU and U.S. regulators will now rely on each other’s inspections for manufacturing sites for human medicines in their respective territories.
 Non-compliance with EU requirements, particularly regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, can also result in the marketing authorization holder becoming subject to significant financial penalties. Inspections may be routine or triggered by issues arising during the assessment of the dossier or by other information, such as previous inspection experience. Inspections usually are requested during the initial review of a marketing authorization application, but could arise post-authorization. Regulatory authorities in the EU may suspend, revoke or vary a marketing authorization of a medicinal product if they consider that the product is harmful, lacks therapeutic efficacy, its risk-benefit balance is not favorable, its qualitative and quantitative composition is not as declared or for certain other reasons.
 A marketing authorization holder may not delegate its ultimate legal responsibility for complying with its legal requirements nor any liability for failing to do so. However, the marketing authorization holder may delegate the performance of certain tasks to third parties, provided this is appropriately documented and managed. It is also possible to transfer a marketing authorization to a third party.
 The EU’s medicines rules do not require the launch of a product in a particular member state, but do contain the sunset rules described above requiring that for a centrally-approved product, the product must be marketed in at least one member European Economic Area state within three years of approval (unless that deadline is extended) or the marketing authorization may cease to be valid. However, once a medicinal product is launched in a particular member state, the marketing authorization holder is under a legal obligation to take steps to ensure it meets demand for the product in that country.
 As in the U.S., EU law and the regulatory systems in EU member states tightly regulate the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. Unlike in the U.S., EU law prohibits the advertising of prescription-only medicinal products (such as Inbrija) directly to patients or the general public. Advertising to healthcare professionals is permitted, provided certain conditions are met. Certain activities fall outside the scope of EU medicines advertising rules, such as direct responses to requests for information and the dissemination of factual, informative non-promotional announcements and reference material. All advertising for a medicine must be consistent with the product’s approved Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, factual, accurate, balanced and non-misleading. Advertisements to healthcare professionals must adhere to certain specific requirements. For example, the provision of inducements to healthcare professionals designed to promote the prescription, supply, sale or consumption of medicinal products is not permitted, and some member states have expanded this prohibition to cover inducements to healthcare organizations. The promotion of a medicine pre-approval is prohibited as is the promotion of off-label use and promotion that is inconsistent with the product’s SmPC. While EU law provides a framework for medicines advertising rules, national laws, guidance and regulatory codes (or self-regulatory codes) can lead to differences in approach at the national level.
 We have entered into distribution and supply agreements with Esteve Pharmaceuticals for the commercialization of Inbrija in Germany and Spain, and we may enter into similar transactions for the commercialization of Inbrija in other EU countries in the future. We have not transferred our EU marketing authorization to Esteve and do not intend on transferring the authorization to any other party with whom we may enter into such a transaction. Accordingly, if Esteve or another distributor or collaborator for Inbrija in the EU fails to comply with EU legal requirements, we may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions, and there can be no assurance that contractual terms and conditions will provide us with adequate rights and remedies, and actions required to protect against enforcement actions or to enforce such rights could be costly and time consuming.
 Products such as Inbrija that combine a drug and device co-packaged in a single presentation are regulated under the EU’s medicines rules and medical device rules respectively. Additionally, Inbrija’s marketing authorization requires that the medicinal product may only be used with the Inbrija inhaler, and so the inhaler device is a “referenced device.” In order to be lawfully placed on the market, the device must be compliant with the relevant EU law on medical devices. As of May 26, 2021, the Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) implemented a harmonized medical devices regulatory framework in the EU. It repealed and replaced the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD). The MDD and now the MDR and their associated guidance documents and harmonized standards govern, among other things, device design and development, preclinical and clinical or performance testing, premarket conformity assessment, registration and listing,

manufacturing, labeling, storage, claims, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance, vigilance, and market surveillance.
In order to be placed on the market in the EU, a medical device must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, to verify compliance with the relevant requirements (including the Essential Requirements set out in Annex I of the MDD, replaced by the General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) in Annex I of the MDR), and the manufacturer must affix the Conformité Européene mark, or CE Mark, to the product. The conformity assessment procedure depends on the risk class of the device. Medical devices in the EU are classified into one of four classes: I, IIa, IIb and III, with Class I being the lowest risk and Class III being the highest. Under the MDD, the Inbrija inhaler was a Class I device, for which the manufacturer may carry out its own conformity assessment procedure and self-certify compliance with the essential requirements, before affixing the CE mark.
 However, under the MDR, the Inbrija inhaler is up-classified to a Class II product. The conformity assessment procedure for a Class II product must be conducted by a third-party organization designated to conduct conformity assessments, known as a Notified Body. The Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity, which entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE Mark to its devices after having prepared and signed a related EU Declaration of Conformity.
 Transitional provisions in the MDR allow devices that are Class I under the MDD and that are up-classified to a Class II (or above) under the MDR to continue to be placed on the market under the MDD CE mark until December 31, 2028. We have appointed a Notified Body and are planning to undergo an MDR inspection in the first half of 2023.
Other Regulations
 In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products, as well as medical devices, are potentially subject to regulation and oversight by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and state and local governments. Controlled substances that are scheduled by the DEA are subject to additional regulatory requirements including, among other things, special security and handling requirements, and potential restrictions on manufacturing, distribution, sales, and marketing. Sales, marketing, scientific/educational grant programs, and other Acorda interactions with healthcare professionals must comply with the anti-kickback and fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act and the False Claims Act, and may be affected by the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, and/or the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (VHCA). For products to be covered by Medicaid, drug manufacturers must enter into a rebate agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services on behalf of the states and must regularly submit certain pricing information to CMS. Under the VHCA, we are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense, or DOD, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal health care programs including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, discounted prices must also be offered for certain DOD purchases for its TRICARE retail pharmacy program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
 Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 Under the Sunshine Act provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to federal reporting requirements with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, physician assistants, advance practice nurses, and teaching hospitals. Reports submitted under these requirements are placed on a public database. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS annually. Similarly, the ACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to annually report to FDA samples of prescription drugs requested by and distributed to healthcare providers. The law does not state whether these sample disclosures will be made publicly available, and the FDA has not provided any additional guidance as to how the data will be used.


Pharmaceutical research and development and manufacturing activities are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including, among other matters, those governing: laboratory procedures and the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment, remediation and disposal of hazardous substances; the exposure of persons to hazardous substances; the release of pollutants into the air and bodies of water; and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. Pharmaceutical research and development and manufacturing activities and the activities of our third-party manufacturers involve the use of hazardous substances, and the risk of injury, contamination, or noncompliance with the applicable environmental, health and safety requirements cannot be eliminated. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. Although compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations have tended to become increasingly stringent and, to the extent legal or regulatory changes occur in the future, they could result in, among other things, increased costs to us. Although we assigned our Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing facility lease to Catalent Pharma Solutions in February 2021, we remain responsible for certain contingent environmental liabilities should an issue arise in the future relating to the operation of the facility prior to the assignment.
 Reimbursement and Pricing Controls
 In many of the markets where we or a collaborator or distributor markets or may potentially market one of our approved products, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls, by law, and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms.
 In the U.S., there has been an increased focus on drug pricing in recent years. Although there are currently no direct government price controls over private sector purchases in the U.S., federal legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay prescribed rebates on certain drugs to certain public healthcare programs, such as Medicaid, in order for the drugs to be eligible for reimbursement under those programs. Various states have adopted further mechanisms under Medicaid and other programs that seek to control drug prices, including by disfavoring certain higher priced drugs and by seeking supplemental rebates from manufacturers. Managed care and pharmaceutical benefit managers have also become a potent force in the marketplace that increase downward pressure on the prices of pharmaceutical products. Heightened scrutiny of the prices of several drug products have led to numerous other proposals, at both the federal and state level, to address perceived issues related to drug pricing and drug transparency. Several other states have adopted or are considering adopting laws that require pharmaceutical companies to provide notice prior to raising pricing and other information related to price increases. The current U.S. administration has indicated an interest in measures designed to lower drug costs, and there continues to be political pressure at both the U.S. federal and state levels related to drug pricing and drug transparency that could result in legislative or administrative actions, or at a minimum continued scrutiny. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 Under the reimbursement methodology set forth in the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, physicians are reimbursed for drugs they administer to Medicare beneficiaries based on a product's "average sales price," or ASP. This ASP-based reimbursement methodology has generally led to lower reimbursement levels. The MMA also established the Medicare Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit, which is provided primarily through private entities that attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. The ACA, as amended, requires drug manufacturers to provide a 70% discount on prescriptions for branded products filled while the beneficiary is in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the “donut hole.”
 The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 resulted in changes to the way average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price are reported to the government and the formula for calculating required Medicaid rebates. The ACA increased the minimum basic Medicaid rebate for branded prescription drugs to 23.1% and requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay states rebates on prescription drugs dispensed to Medicaid managed care enrollees. In addition, the ACA increased the additional Medicaid rebate on “line extensions” (such as extended-release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, revised the definition of AMP by changing the classes of purchasers included in the calculation, and expanded the entities eligible for discounts under a statutory program available to entities identified under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act.
 The ACA imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The fee (which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes) is based on the manufacturer’s market share of sales of branded drugs and biologics (excluding orphan drugs) to, or pursuant to coverage under, specified U.S. government programs. The ACA also contains a number of provisions, including provisions governing the way that healthcare is financed

by both governmental and private insurers, enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, increased funding for comparative effectiveness research for use in the healthcare industry, and enhancements to fraud and abuse requirements and enforcement.
 Public and private healthcare payers control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payers also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. In particular, many public and private healthcare payers limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA and/or appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. There is extensive regulation of pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement through health systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. The grant of a marketing authorization in many jurisdictions does not necessarily guarantee that a product will be reimbursed in a particular jurisdiction. The approach taken varies by jurisdiction and in most cases a separate reimbursement approval is required. Some jurisdictions operate positive and/or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits and may limit or restrict reimbursement based on the results of health economic assessments. Others control the price of pharmaceutical products through reference pricing approaches where the reimbursement price is determined by the price in other jurisdictions. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products, as exemplified by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, in the United Kingdom which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets (parallel imports) exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
 As of March 1, 2023, we had 111 full-time and 11 temporary employees. We also engage various consultants and contract workers, including approximately 25 sales representatives. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees, consultants and contract workers. In order to achieve our goals, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent and provide a safe and rewarding workplace, with opportunities for growth and career development, supported by competitive compensation, benefits, health and wellness programs.
 We believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace is critical to the Company’s continued growth and success. We take a comprehensive view of diversity, equity and inclusion across different races, ethnicities, tribes, religions, socioeconomic backgrounds, generations, abilities, and expressions of gender and sexual identity. As of March 1, 2023, 48% of our employees were female and 52% were male, and 28% identified as non-white and 72% as white with a relatively equal mix between female and male. We believe our diversity, equity and inclusion aspirations, are important drivers for continued growth. We conduct annual pay equity analyses, with regard to gender and race/ethnicity to help ensure our base pay structures are fair and to identify and remediate potential issues or disparities. We strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind, including sexual or other discriminatory harassment. Our employees have multiple avenues available through which inappropriate behavior can be reported, including a confidential hotline.
We frequently benchmark our compensation practices and benefits programs against those of comparable industries and peer companies, and in the geographic areas where our facilities are located. We believe that our compensation and employee benefits are competitive and allow us to attract and retain qualified employees throughout our organization. In addition to salaries, employee benefits include annual discretionary bonuses, equity awards, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and flexible work schedules, among others.
 Our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel with the knowledge and experience needed for our business. We face intense competition in our hiring efforts with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations. We are increasingly relying on the services of contract sales representatives or other third-party marketing support in response to sales force attrition.

In 2021, we implemented two corporate restructurings to reduce costs, more closely align operating expenses with expected revenue, and focus our resources on Inbrija. As part of these restructurings, we substantially reduced employee headcount. Further restructuring activities may be required in the future, depending in particular on the rate of decline in our sales of Ampyra due to generic competition and whether we are able to sufficiently increase sales of Inbrija. Our restructurings may have other unintended consequences as well, including, for example, making it more difficult for us to attract and retain highly skilled personnel in a competitive environment (particularly given that we have implemented four corporate restructurings since 2017). We have recently experienced workforce attrition in various functions across our business, which may be attributable to our corporate restructurings, our current business circumstances, a combination of both, or other factors. Our efforts to adjust our operations with the reduced workforce may not be successful in preventing disruption to our business, and, as a result, we lack redundancy in important functions across our business. We are increasingly relying on the services of contract sales representatives and potentially third-party promotional partnerships or other similar arrangements in response to sales force attrition. Further loss of one or more of our key employees, additional loss of multiple employees in particular functions, and/or our inability to attract replacement or additional qualified personnel could substantially impair our ability to operate our business and implement our business plan.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations.
Risk Factors Summary
 An investment in our securities is subject to various risks, the most significant of which are summarized below.
 •We have a history of operating losses and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future; our prospects for achieving and sustaining profitability in the future will depend primarily on how successful we are in increasing Inbrija sales in the U.S. and establishing collaborations or distribution agreements to sell Inbrija in the EU and other territories outside the U.S., as well as the extent and timing of expected continuing Ampyra sales declines due to generic competition that commenced in 2018.
 •Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain key management and other personnel, and maintain access to expert advisors and consultants; we have recently experienced workforce attrition in various functions 


across our business, we may not be able to adjust our operations in response to prevent disruption to our business, and we lack redundancy in important functions across our business.
 •Our 2021 restructurings and associated organizational changes may not adequately reduce our expenses, may lead to additional workforce attrition, and may cause operational disruptions.
 •We may not be able to repay our convertible senior secured notes when they come due in 2024; we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our notes or to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change.
 •The indenture governing our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 contains restrictions that may make it more difficult to execute our strategy or to effectively compete, and an event of default under the indenture could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to retain title to our assets, including our intellectual property.
 •We are substantially dependent on our ability to increase sales of Inbrija in the U.S. and to a lesser extent commercialize Inbrija in the EU or other countries outside the U.S.; the commercial success of Inbrija depends on market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, adequate reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payors, and other factors; and Inbrija faces competition from other marketed products.
 •We do not have the capabilities to commercialize products outside of the U.S.; we are dependent on our existing collaboration with Biogen for sales of Ampyra in the EU and other countries outside the U.S. where it is approved, and we are dependent on our existing distribution agreements with Esteve for commercialization of Inbrija in Germany and Spain, as well as Biopas Laboratories for the commercialization of Inbrija in Latin America, and we will need to enter into additional collaborations or distribution agreements to commercialize Inbrija in other countries outside the U.S.
 •We rely on Catalent as our sole supplier of Inbrija and ARCUS inhaled therapeutic candidates that we may seek to develop; we rely on the Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing facility that we transferred to Catalent for the manufacture of Inbrija; our business could be harmed if Catalent does not maintain required regulatory approvals for the facility, if there is an interruption in operations, or if there is insufficient manufacturing capacity; and we have substantial long-term financial commitments under our global supply agreement with Catalent for Inbrija.
 •We rely on Patheon as our sole supplier of Ampyra and our business could be harmed if Patheon does not maintain required regulatory approvals for the facility, if there is an interruption in operations, or if there is insufficient manufacturing capacity.
 •We have no manufacturing capabilities for our products or product candidates and we are dependent upon third parties to supply the materials for, and to manufacture, our other products and product candidates (and in many cases these are single source suppliers). 
 •We face risks related to health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 global pandemic, that could adversely affect our operations or financial results.
 •We operate in the highly regulated industry, and our business could be harmed and we could incur substantial liabilities if we (or our contractors, partners, collaborators or distributors) fail to comply with stringent federal, state and foreign legal and regulatory requirements relating to matters such as pharmaceutical marketing and promotion, safety and adverse event monitoring and reporting, fraud and abuse, false claims, Medicare rebate and other governmental pricing programs, and reporting of payments of certain health care practitioners.
 •The identification of new side effects from our products, or side effects that are more frequent or severe than in the past, could harm our business by leading to a significant decrease in sales or the withdrawal of marketing approval in the U.S., the EU, or other jurisdictions.
 •We rely on specialty pharmacies to dispense our products, deliver customer support, and provide us with related services, and our business could be harmed and we could be subject to liabilities if these services are performed inadequately or in a manner that does not comply with applicable laws and regulations.
 •We do not have any active drug development programs and may never commercialize any new products; because of our limited financial resources, we previously suspended work on all research and development programs, and as part of our financial management efforts, we are allowing the intellectual property associated with certain of these programs to lapse; even if we were to recommence investment in drug development programs, drug development is highly risky and uncertain, and programs may never result in a commercialized product despite significant investment.


•Our business depends on our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and proprietary trade secrets and know how, avoiding infringing the intellectual property of other parties, and complying with third-party licenses to the intellectual property of others.
 •We depend on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business, and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems, or a system error, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 •Our stock price may be volatile and you may lose all or part of your investment.
 •Substantial dilution could result from future issuances of our common stock, shares underlying existing or future equity awards to employees and directors, the possible issuance of shares to holders of our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 to settle all or a portion of our conversion or make-whole payment obligations under, and/or interest payments on, those notes, and/or the possible sale of shares pursuant to financing transactions.
 •Certain provisions of Delaware law, our Certificate of Incorporation, and our Bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable or may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change our directors or our management, which could decrease the value of our shares.
 •We received a notice from Nasdaq that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price listing rule and we have received an extension until June 20, 2023 to comply with this rule; if we have not achieved compliance by June 20, 2023, we are committed to effecting a reverse stock split that had been approved by stockholders in November 2022; we cannot predict the effect that our reverse stock split will have on the market price for shares of our common stock.
 Risks related to our business
 We have a history of operating losses and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future; we are substantially dependent on our ability to successfully market and sell Inbrija.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $936.3 million. We had a net loss of $65.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have historically been highly dependent on sales of Ampyra in the U.S., but have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from several generic versions of Ampyra that began entering the market in the U.S. in late 2018. Additional manufacturers may market generic versions of Ampyra, and we expect our Ampyra sales will continue to decline over time.
 Our prospects for achieving and sustaining profitability in the future will depend primarily on how successful we are in increasing Inbrija sales in the U.S. and establishing partnerships to sell Inbrija in the EU and other territories outside the U.S., as well as the extent and timing of continuing Ampyra sales declines due to generic competition. If we are not successful in executing our business plan, we may not achieve or sustain profitability and even if we do so, we may not meet sales expectations. Also, even if we are successful in executing our business plan, our ability to achieve and sustain profitability in the future will also depend on our ability to manage our operating costs, and profitability may fluctuate from period to period due to our level of investments in sales and marketing, research and development, and product and product candidate acquisitions.
 We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to continue to sufficiently fund our operations and pay our substantial debt.
 We will need to expend substantial resources for commercialization of our marketed products, including costs associated with the commercialization of Inbrija. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including $207.1 million of convertible senior secured notes that mature in December 2024, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to support our operations and service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. Also, research and development programs will not generate any revenues for us for the foreseeable future, if ever, because they have been either suspended or are in early stages, and are subject to numerous risks including those described elsewhere in these risk factors.
 Our ability to meet our future operating requirements, repay our liabilities, and meet our other obligations, and continue as a going concern are dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to generate cash from product

sales, reduce planned expenditures, maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and obtain additional financing. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from the sale of our products, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, subject to the restrictions contained in the indenture governing our 2024 Notes, such as further reducing expenses, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional capital on terms that may be onerous and which are likely to be highly dilutive. Also, our ability to raise additional capital and repay or restructure our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, among other factors. In addition, financing may not be available when needed, at all, on terms acceptable to us or in compliance with the restrictions contained in our debt instruments. Furthermore, a determination that there is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern is generally viewed unfavorably by current and prospective investors, as well as by analysts and creditors. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to engage in any of the alternative activities, or engage in such activities on desirable terms, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as result in a default on our debt obligations. If we are unable to take these actions, we may be forced to significantly alter our business strategy, substantially curtail our current operations, or cease operations altogether.
 Our future operating requirements may change and will depend on numerous factors. These include the possibility that our common stock could be delisted from Nasdaq, which would have significant negative consequences under the indenture governing the 2024 Notes. If our common stock is delisted, holders of the 2024 Notes would have the right to require us to repurchase the 2024 Notes for 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, and result in an increase in the conversion rates of such notes. If holders representing a significant amount of the 2024 Notes were to exercise this repurchase right, we would be unable to pay, which would result in a default under the indenture governing the 2024 Notes. Such a default could, in turn, result in our bankruptcy or liquidation. On November 11, 2022, we held a special meeting of stockholders in order to authorize our Board of Directors to approve the amendment and restatement of our Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split at a ratio of any whole number in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-20 within one year following the conclusion of the special meeting. At the special meeting, our stockholders voted to authorize the Board of Directors to effect a reverse stock split. We have received an extension until June 20, 2023 to comply with the minimum bid price rule. In the event we have not achieved compliance by June 20, 2023, we are committed to effecting a reverse stock split that had been approved by stockholders in November 2022.
 Our restructurings and associated organizational changes may not adequately reduce our expenses, may lead to additional workforce attrition, and may cause operational disruptions.
 In 2021, we implemented two corporate restructurings to reduce costs, more closely align operating expenses with expected revenue, and focus our resources on Inbrija. As part of these restructurings, we substantially reduced employee headcount. Further restructuring activities may be required in the future, depending in particular on the rate of decline in our sales of Ampyra due to generic competition and whether we are able to sufficiently increase sales of Inbrija. Our restructurings may have other unintended consequences as well, including, for example, making it more difficult for us to attract and retain highly skilled personnel in a competitive environment (particularly given that we have implemented four corporate restructurings since 2017). We have recently experienced workforce attrition in various functions across our business, which may be attributable to our corporate restructurings, our current business circumstances, a combination of both, or other factors. Our efforts to adjust our operations with the reduced workforce may not be successful in preventing disruption to our business, and with the reduced workforce, we lack redundancy in important functions across our business. We are increasingly relying on the services of contract sales representatives and potentially third-party promotional partnerships or other similar arrangements in response to substantial sales force attrition. Further loss of one or more of our key employees, additional loss of multiple employees in particular functions, and/or our inability to attract replacement or additional qualified personnel could substantially impair our ability to operate our business and implement our business plan, particularly our efforts to successfully commercialize Inbrija.
 We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our convertible notes or to repurchase notes upon a fundamental change.
 Holders of our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, including a delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. This use of cash may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Furthermore, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make cash payments with respect to the 2024 Notes, whether upon maturity, conversion, or occurrence of a fundamental change. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future

indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture pursuant to which the notes were issued or to make cash payments to settle conversions or make interest payments (including make-whole interest payments) as required by the notes indenture, would constitute a default under the indenture. If our common stock is delisted, this would constitute a fundamental change under the indenture governing the 2024 Notes and holders of the 2024 Notes would have the right to require us to repurchase the 2024 Notes for 100% of their principal amount. If holders representing a significant amount of the 2024 Notes were to exercise this repurchase right, we would be unable to pay, which would result in a default under the indenture governing the 2024 Notes. Such a default could, in turn, result in our bankruptcy or liquidation. While our stockholders voted on November 11, 2022 to authorize the Board of Directors to effect a reverse stock split, there can be no assurance that this or any other measures will be sufficient to avoid a delisting of our common stock and thereby trigger a fundamental change repurchase offer to holders of our 2024 Notes as described above. We received a notice from Nasdaq that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price listing rule and we have received an extension until June 20, 2023 to comply with this rule. If we have not achieved compliance by June 20, 2023, we are committed to effecting a reverse stock split that had been approved by stockholders in November 2022. However, there can be no assurance that effecting a reverse stock split will ensure compliance with the minimum bid price rule and we cannot predict the effect that a reverse stock split will have on the market price for shares of our common stock.
 The indenture governing our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 contains restrictions that may make it more difficult to execute our strategy or to effectively compete.
 Subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, the indenture governing our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 restricts our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) pay dividends or make other payments or distributions on capital stock, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any capital stock, (ii) make certain investments, (iii) incur indebtedness or issue preferred stock, other than certain forms of permitted debt, which includes, among other items, indebtedness incurred to refinance our convertible senior notes, (iv) create liens on assets, (v) sell assets, (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates or (vii) merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all assets. The indenture also requires us to make an offer to repurchase the convertible senior secured notes due 2024 upon the occurrence of certain asset sales. These restrictions may make it difficult to successfully execute our business strategy, including limiting our ability to engage in certain collaborations or transactions involving Inbrija and certain intellectual property, or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted.
 An event of default under the indenture governing our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to retain title to our assets, including our intellectual property.
 The indenture governing our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 provides that a number of events will constitute an event of default, including, among other things, (i) a failure to pay interest for 30 days, (ii) failure to pay the convertible senior secured notes when due at maturity, upon any required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise, (iii) failure to convert the convertible senior secured notes in accordance with the indenture and the failure continues for five business days, (iv) not issuing certain notices required by the notes indenture within a timely manner, (v) failure to comply with the other covenants or agreements in the notes indenture for 60 days following the receipt of a notice of non-compliance, (vi) a default or other failure by us to make required payments under our other indebtedness or certain subsidiaries having an outstanding principal amount of $30.0 million or more, (vii) failure by us or certain subsidiaries to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $30.0 million, (viii) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency and (ix) the commercial launch in the U.S. of a product determined by the FDA to be bioequivalent to Inbrija. Certain of these potential events of default may occur as a result of factors beyond our control.
 In the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, all outstanding convertible senior secured notes due 2024 will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding convertible senior secured notes due 2024 may declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately. Such acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity if we are unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with the holders of the convertible senior secured notes due 2024 or if alternate funding is not available to us. Furthermore, if we are unable to repay the convertible senior secured notes due 2024 upon an acceleration or otherwise, we would be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation and we would lose title to substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property.


The commercial success of Inbrija and any other future products are highly dependent on market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, adequate reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payers, and other factors.
 We face significant challenges in successfully commercializing our approved pharmaceutical products, including Inbrija. Generally, market acceptance of our products depends on the benefits of our products in terms of safety, efficacy, convenience, ease of administration and cost effectiveness and our ability to demonstrate these benefits to physicians, patients and third-party payers. Commercial success requires significant investment in sales, marketing and market access efforts, and is dependent on how well we develop and implement strategies for these efforts. Commercial success is also subject to numerous other risks, including those described below, some of which are described in further detail elsewhere in these risk factors:
 •Market Access: Physicians may be discouraged from prescribing our products and/or patients may not fill or refill prescriptions for our products because of the reimbursement policies or decisions of third-party payers such as commercial insurance companies and government and government-sponsored payers such as Medicare. Our sales may suffer if Inbrija or other products are not listed on the preferred drug lists of third-party payers, or if Inbrija or other products do not receive a pricing or reimbursement approval, are on the preferred drug list but subject to unfavorable limitations or preconditions or in disadvantageous positions on tiered formularies. Preconditions or other reimbursement limitations imposed by third-party payers may discourage physicians from prescribing Inbrija or other products because of the time and effort that may be needed by the prescribing physician to overcome these hurdles. Even if physicians prescribe Inbrija or another product, patients may not fill or refill the prescription if their out-of-pocket cost is too high, for example because of inadequate or lack of reimbursement from their insurance company or Medicare.
 •Safety and Efficacy: Physicians may not prescribe our products if they do not consider our products as safe and effective for their labeled indication, and patients may determine, for any reason, that our products are not useful to them. For example, physicians may not believe that the benefits of Inbrija or our future products that we may develop are meaningful for patients or, even if they do believe there is a potential benefit, they may stage or delay the use of Inbrija with patients or patient groups to evaluate patient feedback or for other reasons.
 •Side Effects: Market acceptance of Inbrija or another product may be impeded by the occurrence of any side effects, adverse reactions, customer complaints or misuse (or any unfavorable publicity relating thereto) stemming from the use of the product or identified in ongoing or future studies. As further described below, FDA and EU-approved product labeling for Inbrija includes limitations, warnings and precautions, which may harm its market acceptance. For example, the Inbrija product label identifies cough as one of the most common adverse reactions observed in our clinical trials, and the risk of cough may discourage some patients from taking Inbrija, and the actual occurrence of cough has led some patients to discontinue Inbrija. Also, in 2020, we updated the Inbrija U.S. and EU-approved labels to add “sensation of choking immediately following administration” as a potential adverse reaction.
 •Competition: The market for Inbrija may be adversely affected by the development of products that compete with or are an alternative to Inbrija or any future products that we may develop, the timing of market entry for competing or alternative products, the perceived advantages of competing or alternative therapies over our products, and the pricing of (and reimbursement available for) our products as compared to the pricing of (and reimbursement available for) competing or alternative products. For example, as further described below in these risk factors, Inbrija competes with Apokyn, an injectable formulation of apomorphine, as well as Kynmobi, a sublingual, or under the tongue, formulation of apomorphine, both of which are approved for the acute, intermittent treatment of OFF periods.
 •Intellectual Property: The loss of intellectual property protection for our products would enable generic competition. Ampyra became subject to generic competition in the U.S. in late 2018, due to the invalidation of certain Ampyra patents, and our Ampyra sales have been declining since then and are expected to continue to decline over time.
 Also, in the U.S., the federal government provides funding for comparative effectiveness research, which may compare our products with other treatments and may result in published findings that would, in turn, discourage use of our products by physicians and payments for our products by payers. Similar research is funded in other countries, including in some countries in Europe.


The failure of any of our products or product candidates, once approved, to achieve market acceptance would limit our ability to generate revenue and would harm our results of operations and could adversely affect our future prospects. If market acceptance of our products in the U.S., EU, or other countries does not meet expectations, our revenues or royalties from product sales would suffer and this could cause our stock price to decline.
 We face risks related to health epidemics, including the COVID-19 global pandemic, that could adversely affect our operations or financial results.
 Our business and financial condition have been impacted by, and are subject to the ongoing risks resulting from, the COVID-19 global pandemic. The COVID-19 global pandemic has caused significant disruptions in the healthcare industry. The duration of the pandemic is difficult to predict, and it is likely to have ongoing impacts as it continues. The travel restrictions, “shelter in place” orders, quarantine policies, vaccine mandates, and general concerns about the spread and effects of COVID-19 have disrupted the delivery of healthcare to patients; for example, the pandemic has made it more difficult for some patients to visit with their physician and obtain pharmaceutical prescriptions. Also, healthcare office staffing shortages may delay the administrative work, and particularly insurance-related documentation, needed to obtain reimbursement for prescriptions. We also believe that the governmental and other restrictions and requirements related to the pandemic may have caused certain patients to lessen their mobility and therefore their need for certain therapeutics. We believe these factors contributed to volatility in new Inbrija prescriptions since the start of the pandemic in 2020 and had continued to impact prescriptions in 2022.
COVID-related policies, restrictions, mandates, and concerns may disrupt our operations and those of our customers and suppliers. Also, our operations could be interrupted if we or our customers or suppliers lose the services of key employees or consultants who become ill from COVID-19. These types of disruptions could potentially affect any of our critical business functions, and thus harm our business, including for example our sales and marketing operations as well compliance and certain general and administrative functions. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. As the pandemic continues, it may cause continuing economic volatility or result in a sustained economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and our ability to access capital on reasonable terms, or at all. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 We operate in the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry.
 Pharmaceutical research, development, preclinical and clinical trial activities, as well as the manufacture and marketing of any products that we have developed or in the future may successfully develop, are subject to an extensive regulatory approval process by the FDA and other regulatory agencies and authorities abroad.
Both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, the process of obtaining required regulatory approvals for drugs is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Any regulatory approvals may be for fewer or narrower indications or other conditions of approval than we request, may include distribution restrictions, or may be conditioned on burdensome post-approval study or other requirements, including the requirement that we institute and follow a special risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to monitor and manage potential safety issues, all of which may eliminate or reduce the drug's market potential. Additional adverse events that could impact commercial success, or even continued regulatory approval, might emerge with more extensive post-approval patient use. In the U.S., investigational products that rely on device components to deliver drug to patients, such as Inbrija, are regulated as combination products and require that we satisfy FDA that both the drug and device component of the products satisfy FDA requirements. Failure to satisfy the FDA’s requirements for either the drug or device component of such combination products could delay approval of these products or result in these products not receiving FDA approval. In the EU, where Inbrija has received a marketing authorization and is co-packaged with a medical device (the Inbrija inhaler), the overall product is regulated under the EU’s medicines rules, but the device must be CE marked and comply with the EU’s medical devices rules, as further described below in these risk factors. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely affect our ability to market Inbrija in the European Economic Area, or EEA.
 Any product for which we currently have or may in the future obtain marketing approval is subject to continual post-approval requirements including, among other things, record-keeping and reporting requirements, packaging and labeling requirements, requirements for reporting adverse drug experiences, import/export controls, restrictions on advertising and promotion, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements as well as, for example in the U.S., any other requirements imposed by our New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA). All of our products and operations are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Regulatory approval of a

product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to other restrictive conditions of approval that limit our ability to promote, sell or distribute a product. Furthermore, any approval may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Post-market evaluation of a product could result in marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market.
We may fail to comply with existing legal or regulatory requirements or be slow to adapt, or be unable to adapt, to new legal or regulatory requirements. We may encounter problems with manufacturing processes for our products, and we may discover previously unknown problems with our products. These circumstances could result in:
 •voluntary or mandatory recalls;
 •voluntary or mandatory patient or physician notification;
 •withdrawal of product approvals;
 •shut-down of manufacturing facilities;
 •receipt of warning letters or untitled letters;
 •product seizures;
 •restrictions on, or prohibitions against, marketing our products;
 •restrictions on importation of our product candidates;
 •fines and injunctions;
 •civil and criminal penalties;
 •exclusion from participation in government programs; and
 •suspension of review or refusal to approve pending applications.
 In addition, we are subject to regulation under other state, federal and foreign laws and regulations, including requirements regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, and controlled substances, and we may be subject to other local, state, federal and foreign regulations. We cannot predict the impact of those regulations on us, although they could impose significant restrictions on our business, and we may have to incur additional expenses to comply with them. We may rely on collaborators within or outside the U.S. for the manufacture, sale and/or marketing of our pharmaceutical products. The failure of these other companies to comply with laws and regulations applicable to them or the activities they perform for us could similarly harm our business.
 We must obtain a CE mark for the Inbrija inhaler under the EU Medical Devices Regulation, otherwise we and any collaborators or distributors would have to cease marketing Inbrija in the EU until the CE mark is obtained.
In the EU, Inbrija is considered a medicinal product that is co-packaged with a medical device, the inhaler. This device is required to comply with the applicable EU medical device rules. Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) has applied from May 26, 2021 and repealed and replaced the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD). For us or our collaborators or distributors to place the device on the market in the EU, the device must undergo the applicable conformity assessment and have a CE mark affixed. Under the MDD, as the Inbrija inhaler was a Class I device, we self-certified the conformity of the device against the MDD’s requirements (including the Essential Requirements included in Annex I) and affixed a CE mark. Now under the MDR, the inhaler is a Class II device and so the conformity assessment procedure to confirm compliance with the MDR (including the General Safety and Performance Requirements included in Annex I) has to be carried out by a Notified Body (a third-party organization designated by a member state of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments) before we can affix a CE mark.
 We have not yet CE marked the Inbrija inhaler under the MDR. However, under the MDR’s transition period, we can continue to place the device on the market under the MDD CE mark until the end 2027 for high-risk devices and the end 2028 for lower-risk devices, so long as it continues to comply with the MDD and we make no significant changes to the design or intended purpose of the device. Failure to obtain an MDR CE mark by the transition deadline, and/or to retain our MDD CE mark until that date would mean we and any collaborators or distributors could not lawfully market Inbrija with the Inbrija inhaler in the EU. As the marketing authorization for Inbrija requires that the medicinal product can only be used with

the Inbrija inhaler device, this would mean the medicinal product could not be made available to patients in the EU until the device is CE marked under the MDR.
 We have appointed a Notified Body and are planning to undergo an MDR inspection in the first half of 2023. However, if the Notified Body disagrees with our classification of the Inbrija inhaler device or otherwise does not agree with our approach and requires further changes, there is a risk we may fail to obtain a CE mark under the MDR before the end of the transitional period end 2027 for high-risk devices and end 2028 for lower- risk devices, in which case we and any collaborators or distributors would have to cease marketing Inbrija until the CE mark is obtained.
We have no manufacturing capabilities for our products or product candidates, and we are dependent upon third parties to supply the materials for, and to manufacture, our products and product candidates.
 We do not own or operate, and currently do not plan to own or operate, facilities for production and packaging of our products or product candidates. We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the production and packaging, APIs, inactive ingredients, and finished dosage forms of our products and product candidates, and where relevant any medical devices that are part of our products or product candidates. We similarly expect to continue to rely on third parties for the supply of materials for research and development activities, particularly any clinical trials we may conduct in the future. In addition, due to the unique manner in which our products are manufactured, in many cases we rely on single source providers for our commercial and investigational products, or components of those products. This dependence on others may harm our ability to develop and commercialize our products on a timely and competitive basis. Any such failure may result in decreased product sales and lower product revenue, which would harm our business.
 As described elsewhere in this report, we sold our Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing operations to Catalent and rely on Catalent for the manufacture and supply of Inbrija. As our Inbrija supplier, Catalent is responsible for all Inbrija components other than the inhaler and levodopa, the Inbrija API. We have relied, and we expect to continue relying, on third parties to supply the inhaler and levodopa. Also, we rely on a separate company to package the final Inbrija kits. Any failure or delay by a third-party manufacturer, packager, or supplier may delay or impair our ability to commercialize Inbrija or to complete any future clinical studies that may be needed. Although in some cases we have contracts for these requirements, we cannot be certain that those contracts will be renewed on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. This may be made more complex in certain circumstances if we do not have contracts with suppliers, such as in the case of Inbrija where we currently do not have a contract with the supplier of the API, which exposes us to the risk that they could discontinue supply at any time. Manufacturers, packagers or suppliers may choose not to conduct business with us at all, or may choose to discontinue doing business with us, for example if they determine that our particular business requirements would be unprofitable or otherwise not appropriate for their business. We do not control how Catalent sources the other components of Inbrija, but we are aware that they rely on a single supplier for a critical excipient used for Inbrija manufacturing and they could rely on single suppliers for other components. Our business could be similarly exposed to risk if and to the extent they rely on single source suppliers or do not have supply contracts.
 We currently rely on a single third-party molding manufacturer for supply of the Inbrija inhalers. Our reliance on a third party for the manufacture of inhalers increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our inhalers or will not be able to obtain such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our commercialization of Inbrija. If the inhaler supplier fails to provide sufficient inhaler supply, we would need enter into alternative arrangements with a different supplier. Transition to a new inhaler supplier would be a lengthy and complex process. Among other things, we would have to revalidate the molding and assembly processes pursuant to FDA requirements and we would have to ensure that inhalers manufactured by the new supplier adhere to other applicable regulatory requirements.
 Our reliance on third-party manufacturers, packagers, and suppliers subjects us to risks associated with their businesses and operations. For example, even if we have agreements with third parties, they may not perform their obligations to us and/or they may be unable or unwilling to establish or increase production capacity commensurate with our needs. Also, third-party manufacturers, packagers, and suppliers are subject to their own operational and financial risks that are outside of our control, and potentially their control also, that may cause them to suffer liquidity or operational problems and that could interfere with their business operations. For example, their operations and/or ability to source raw materials and other supplies may be interrupted by natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or disease outbreaks (such as the COVID-19 global pandemic). In addition, the manufacture and distribution of our products and product candidates, including product components such as API, and the manufacture of medical devices, are highly regulated, and any failure to comply with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our supply of products or our access to materials needed for product development. The third parties we rely on are subject to regulatory review, and any regulatory compliance problems could

significantly delay or disrupt commercialization of our products. U.S. and foreign governments and regulatory authorities continue to propose legislative and other measures relating to the manufacture or distribution of pharmaceutical products, including revisions to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. Third-party manufacturers may be unable or unwilling to comply with new legislative or regulatory measures, and/or compliance with new requirements could increase the price we must pay for our products.
 The manufacturing facilities used to produce our products, including those of our third-party manufacturers, packagers and suppliers, must comply with cGMPs and will likely have to pass a pre-approval FDA inspection and potentially other inspections required by other regulatory authorities. Third-party manufacturers, packagers and suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections for cGMP compliance from the FDA and potentially other regulatory authorities. Failure to pass such inspections and otherwise satisfactorily complete the requisite approval regimen with respect to our products or product candidates may result in regulatory actions by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, such as the issuance of FDA Form 483 notices of observations, warning letters, injunctions, facility shut-downs, product seizures, loss of operating licenses, and other civil and criminal penalties. Based on the severity of the regulatory action, our clinical or commercial supplies could be interrupted or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In some cases, these third-party manufacturers may also be subject to GMP inspections by foreign regulatory authorities. Failure to pass such inspections by foreign regulatory authorities could impede our ability to manufacture product needed for clinical trials or impede our ability to secure product approvals.
 If any of our third-party manufacturers, packagers or suppliers fails to perform their obligations to us or otherwise have an interruption in or discontinue supply to us, we may be forced to seek a different third-party manufacturer, packager or supplier. In such event, we may experience significant delays associated with finding an alternative manufacturer, packager or supplier that is both available on commercially acceptable terms and conditions, and also properly qualified in accordance with our specifications and the requisite regulatory requirements, such as those of the FDA and other regulatory authorities. This transition may require time consuming and complex operational, testing, and regulatory approval requirements, and the process could interfere with product sales because of inadequate supply or cause interruptions of, or delays in, research and development programs. We may not be able to establish arrangements with an alternative manufacturer, packager or supplier on reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture our products or product candidates or the API, excipients or other components of such products or product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer or supplier and we may have difficulty, or there may be contractual restrictions prohibiting us from, transferring such skills to a backup or alternative supplier, or we may be unable to transfer such skills at all.
 Until October 2022, we relied on Alkermes to supply us with our requirements for Ampyra. Following the arbitration panel decision described elsewhere in this report, we were free to use alternative sources of supply for Ampyra. We have since engaged with Patheon to supply our future Ampyra needs at a significantly reduced cost. We and our suppliers also rely on a single third-party manufacturer to supply dalfampridine, the API in Ampyra, and also a single supplier for a critical excipient used in the manufacture of Ampyra. If these companies experience any disruption in their operations, our supply of Ampyra could be delayed or interrupted until the problem is solved or we locate another source of supply or packager, which may not be available. We may not be able to enter into alternative supply or packaging arrangements on terms that are commercially reasonable, if at all. Any new supplier or packager would also be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements. Because of these and other factors, we could experience substantial delays before we are able to obtain qualified replacement products or services from any new supplier or packager.
We completed the sale of our Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing operations in February 2021, and accordingly we rely on Catalent as our sole supplier for the manufacture of Inbrija and any ARCUS product candidates we may seek to further develop.
 In connection with the sale of the Chelsea manufacturing operations, we entered into a long-term global supply agreement under which a Catalent affiliate will manufacture Inbrija on an exclusive basis (other than for sale in China). As described elsewhere in this report, on December 31, 2022, we terminated the existing supply agreement with Catalent and effective January 1, 2023 entered into a new supply agreement with more favorable terms. We are reliant on Catalent for all of our Inbrija supply and supply of other ARCUS inhaled therapeutic product candidates. Although Catalent has significant experience in commercial manufacturing, given applicable regulatory requirements and the complexity of the manufacturing processes for pharmaceuticals, Catalent may be unable or otherwise not successful in passing any required regulatory inspection as a condition to manufacturing, carrying out its contractual duties, meeting expected deadlines or effectively manufacturing or releasing Inbrija in a timely manner in accordance with our contractual arrangements, current good manufacturing practices and other regulatory requirements. If we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of Inbrija under our

supply agreement with Catalent, or if the supplies we receive do not meet quality and safety standards, we could face supply shortages, significant additional costs, product liability claims and reputational harm. Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 We continue to discuss potential ARCUS collaborations with other companies that express interest in formulating their novel molecules using ARCUS, and have already performed feasibility studies for a number of these opportunities. However, currently we are not investing in any proprietary ARCUS research and development programs. Should we decide to proceed with any ARCUS development program, we would be reliant on Catalent or another third-party supplier for the manufacture of product for that program. Our global supply agreement does not provide for the terms and conditions under which Catalent would supply any product or product candidate other than Inbrija, or under which Catalent would provide support for ARCUS research and development. We would be unable to advance the development of any ARCUS inhaled therapeutic candidate unless Catalent is willing to manufacture the candidate for us on commercially reasonable terms, or we could identify another third-party manufacturer that would be capable and willing to manufacture the candidate on commercially reasonable terms. Also, due to reductions in force, employee attrition and the 2021 sale of our Chelsea manufacturing operations, we may need to hire replacement personnel or engage consultants to continue with ARCUS research and development work beyond feasibility and similar early-stage studies.
 Establishing our global supply agreement with Catalent required that we share proprietary trade secrets and know-how relating to Inbrija and our ARCUS platform. We have sought to protect that information pursuant to various operational safeguards and confidentiality and other requirements set forth in the global supply agreement. We are reliant on Catalent’s compliance with those provisions, and even if Catalent does comply with those provisions, they may not provide adequate protection or prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of the information. The unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary information could harm its value by enabling others to copy or use our information for their own products, methods or technologies, and we may not have an adequate remedy against Catalent or any other party for the harm caused.
 Our new global supply agreement with Catalent contains substantial long-term financial commitments.
 Under the New MSA, Catalent will continue to manufacture Inbrija through 2030, with reduced minimum annual commitments through 2024 and significantly lower pricing thereafter. The New MSA provides for the scale-up of new spray drying equipment (“PSD-7”), which will provide expanded capacity for the long-term world-wide manufacturing requirements of Inbrija, which is expected to operational in 2026. We will be subject to purchase commitments in 2023 and 2024 of 15 and 24 batches of Inbrija, respectively, at a total cost of $10.5 million and $15.5 million, respectively. Thereafter, in 2025, we will pay Catalent a fixed per capsule fee based on the amount of Inbrija that is delivered for sale in the United States and other markets. In addition, we have agreed to a minimum purchase requirement of at least three batches per year on the PSD-7 equipment. In addition, we will be obligated to pay Catalent $2 million in 2023 in connection with certain activities relating to the operational readiness of the PSD-7 and we will provide up to $1 million in each of 2023 and 2024 for capital expenditures to assist in the capacity expansion efforts. While we believe these purchase commitments are sufficient for our forecasted supply needs for Inbrija, we cannot provide assurance that our currently projected needs will be reached or exceeded, depending on global demand for Inbrija. If we are forced to obtain Inbrija from another supplier because Catalent is unable or unwilling to provide adequate Inbrija supply, we may be unable to offset the costs of alternate supply against our purchase commitments under the new MSA.
 We rely on Catalent’s Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing facility for the manufacture of Inbrija, and our business could be harmed if Catalent does not maintain required regulatory approvals to manufacture commercial product at that facility, if there is an interruption in operations at the facility, or if the facility does not have manufacturing capacity needed to meet product demand.
 All commercial supply of Inbrija is currently manufactured at Catalent’s Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing facility. Under our long-term global supply agreement with Catalent, Inbrija will be exclusively manufactured by Catalent at this manufacturing facility (other than for sale in China, which is not covered by the exclusivity provisions of the agreement). Catalent may need expanded manufacturing capacity at the Chelsea facility to meet demand depending on the timing and extent of sales growth. Catalent’s inability to complete any needed expansion of the facility in a timely manner or unexpected demand for commercial quantities of Inbrija could cause a supply shortage that would harm our commercialization of Inbrija in the U.S. and any foreign jurisdictions where we seek to commercialize Inbrija. Any such supply shortages could lead to a breach of our legal obligations to supply Inbrija for our collaboration partners.


Furthermore, if Catalent were to lose the use of the facility or equipment, the manufacturing facility and manufacturing equipment would be difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead time and substantial additional funds. The facility may be affected by natural disasters, such as floods or fire, or Catalent may lose the use of the facility due to manufacturing issues that arise, such as contamination or regulatory concerns following a regulatory inspection of the facility. Catalent may also unexpectedly experience manufacturing issues as the unintended result of activities occurring at the facility unrelated to Inbrija manufacture. In the event of a loss of the use of all or a portion of the facility or equipment for the reasons stated above or any other reason, Catalent would be unable to manufacture Inbrija until such time as the facility or equipment could be repaired or rebuilt or they are able to address other manufacturing issues at the facility. Any such interruptions in their ability to manufacture Inbrija would harm our business. Even if Catalent does not suffer a loss of the facility or equipment within the facility, manufacturing operations can experience intermittent interruptions due to the need for routine or unexpected maintenance, inspection and repairs of the facility or the equipment, and, depending on their frequency and duration, these intermittent interruptions could also harm our business. While we have the right to use alternative sources of supply in certain circumstances, this is an expensive and lengthy process and there can be no assurance that alternative sources of supply can be arranged on favorable terms, if at all, or in a timely manner to avoid supply interruptions and product distribution delays.
 We do not have back-up manufacturing capability for Inbrija or any ARCUS product candidates, and if Catalent fails to timely perform under our global supply agreement our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed.
 If we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of Inbrija under our supply agreement with Catalent, or if the supplies we receive do not meet quality and safety standards, we could face supply shortages, significant additional costs, product liability claims and reputational harm. Also, if we decide to make further investments in any ARCUS product development programs, we would be unable to advance those programs unless we could obtain adequate supply of the inhaled therapeutic product candidate from Catalent or another third-party manufacturer and on commercially reasonable terms.
 We do not currently have back-up manufacturing capability at another facility and there are only limited third-party manufacturers that we believe would be capable of manufacturing Inbrija or other ARCUS inhaled therapeutic products or product candidates. If the need arises to obtain supply from another third-party manufacturer, there can be no assurance that we could identify a third party that would be capable and willing to manufacture for us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that they could supply us in sufficient quantities on a timely basis to meet our needs.
Engaging a third-party manufacturer to supply ARCUS products or product candidates would likely be a lengthy process due to the complexity and substantial regulation of the manufacturing processes involved. Also, engaging a third party would require the sharing of proprietary information, which increases the risk of the unauthorized use or disclosure of that information and potential harm to our business for which we may not have an adequate remedy. If we are successful in engaging a third-party manufacturer, they may not perform their obligations to us and/or they may be unable or unwilling to establish or increase production capacity commensurate with our needs. Also, third-party manufacturers and suppliers are subject to their own operational and financial risks that are outside of our control, including macro-economic conditions that may cause them to suffer liquidity or operational problems and that could interfere with their business operations.
 Catalent may not successfully complete the expansion of the Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing facility.
 The New MSA provides for the scale-up of PSD-7 spray drying equipment, which will provide expanded capacity for the long-term world-wide manufacturing requirements of Inbrija. We will be obligated to pay Catalent $2 million in 2023 in connection with certain activities relating to the operational readiness of the PSD-7 and will provide up to $1 million in each of 2023 and 2024 for capital expenditures to assist in the capacity expansion efforts. The new size 7 spray dryer manufacturing production line for Inbrija and other ARCUS products that has greater capacity than the existing size 4 spray dyer manufacturing production line, and will create additional warehousing space for manufactured product. This expansion will require approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities before the PSD-7 can be used to manufacture Inbrija. Also, manufacturing scale-up generally is subject to significant risks related to process development and manufacturing yields, which is especially true for the manufacture of a product such as Inbrija that involves a highly specialized spray drying and capsule filling process. Lastly, the expanded Chelsea facility will have to continue to comply with cGMP requirements, as described above in these risk factors, as well as other applicable environmental, safety, and other governmental permitting requirements. This expansion project is critically important to our business, and any significant delay or disruption in planned completion could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet anticipated demand for Inbrija in the future.

The challenges described above could delay or prevent Catalent from successfully completing the expansion of the Chelsea manufacturing capacity. If we need the expanded capacity but Catalent is delayed in or prevented from completing the expansion and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, we may need to seek another party to manufacturer additional Inbrija supply for us. As described above in these risk factors, there can be no assurance that we could identify a third party that would be capable and willing to manufacture for us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that they could supply us with product in sufficient quantities on a timely basis to meet our needs. If we cannot obtain increased supply of Inbrija from expanded capacity at the Chelsea facility or engaging another third-party manufacturer, we may not be able to meet demand for Inbrija and this could harm our ability to commercialize Inbrija in the U.S. and any foreign jurisdictions where we seek to commercialize Inbrija. An inability to meet demand in an EU member state or another foreign jurisdiction could lead to a breach of our legal obligations to supply Inbrija and potentially result in regulatory violations by our collaboration partners in certain jurisdictions that require adequate supply of commercial products based on patient need.
 We may incur significant liability if we or our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors, or collaborators fail to comply with stringent U.S. FDA and foreign marketing and promotion regulations.
 The advertising and promotion activities for our products are subject to stringent rules and requirements both in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, which are enforced and overseen by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. These rules and requirements vary from country to country, and promotional practices and materials that are acceptable in one country may not be so in another. Importantly, unlike in the U.S., EU law prohibits the advertising of prescription-only medicinal products (such as Inbrija) directly to patients or the general public. Advertising to healthcare professionals is permitted, provided certain conditions are met.
 Among other requirements, in the U.S. and EU, advertising and promotional materials for our products must not be false or misleading in any respect, and must be appropriately substantiated and fairly balanced with information on the safety risks and limitations of our products. In the U.S., we must submit all promotional materials to the FDA by the time of their first use. Some other jurisdictions require government pre-approval of promotional materials. If the FDA or other regulators raise concerns regarding promotional materials or messages for our products, we or our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors or collaborators may be required to modify or discontinue using them and may be required to provide corrective information. Should we or our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors or collaborators fail to comply with the relevant requirements, in the U.S. or other countries, we may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. In the case where our contract sales representatives or one of our promotional partners, distributors, or collaborators has failed to comply with legal requirements, there can be no assurance that contractual terms and conditions intended to protect our rights and mitigate our risk relating to their misconduct will provide us with adequate rights and remedies, and actions required to protect against enforcement actions or to enforce such rights could be costly and time consuming.
 Each of our products is approved with specific indications and other conditions of use that inform our ability, and the ability of our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors, and collaborators, to promote our products. For example, in the U.S., Inbrija is indicated “for the intermittent treatment of OFF episodes in people with Parkinson’s disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa.” The approved Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, in the EU marketing authorization contains a similar indication. The approved labeling in the U.S. and the EU SmPC also contain other limitations on use and warnings and precautions, the most common adverse reactions, and contraindications for risks. If potential purchasers or those influencing purchasing or prescribing decisions, such as physicians and pharmacists, third-party payers or reimbursement authorities, react negatively to Inbrija or other products because of their perception of the limitations or safety risks in the approved product labeling, it may result in lower product acceptance and lower product revenues.
 In the U.S., EU and many other jurisdictions, we face significant risks if we or our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors, or collaborators promote our drugs “off-label,” i.e., for uses other than those approved by the appropriate regulatory authority in a territory (e.g., the FDA in the U.S.). Physicians may prescribe drug products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those approved by the FDA. Similar rules apply in many countries outside the U.S. Off-label uses are common across medical specialties. In the U.S., although the FDA does not regulate a physician’s choice of treatments, it traditionally has prohibited companies from promoting their drugs for off-label uses. Several federal court cases, based on First Amendment principles, have called into question the FDA’s ability to enforce against companies solely on the basis of truthful and non-misleading off-label promotion of their drugs. It is unclear, however, how the courts ultimately will resolve this issue or how the FDA’s policies may (or may not) change in light of developing case law. Furthermore, off-label promotion of our products could violate advertising and promotion requirements such as the prohibition against false or misleading advertising and/or labeling, or the requirement that approved labeling bear “adequate directions” for all of the product’s “intended uses.” Similarly, although EU law does not in general restrict the

off-label use of a product by healthcare professional, it is unlawful to promote the off-label use of a product or promotion that is inconsistent with the product’s SmPC. Accordingly, we potentially face significant risk of enforcement should we or our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors or collaborators promote Inbrija, Ampyra or any other products in the U.S., EU and potentially other countries for any uses that are not consistent with the products’ approved labeling in the relevant territory. The FDA and other regulatory and enforcement authorities actively enforce laws and regulations regulating promotion of approved drugs as well as the promotion of products for which marketing approval has not been obtained. A company that is found to have violated these requirements may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions, both in the U.S. and potentially other jurisdictions.
Notwithstanding the above-described regulatory restrictions, the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities and EU medicines laws allow companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific exchange concerning their products. We engage in medical education activities and communicate with investigators and potential investigators regarding our clinical trials. Although we believe that all of our communications regarding our marketed and investigational products are in compliance with applicable advertising and promotional regulations, and we seek to ensure that the activities of our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors and collaborators are similarly compliant, the FDA or another regulatory or enforcement authority may disagree.
Any free samples we distribute to physicians must be carefully monitored and controlled, and, in the U.S., must otherwise comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, as amended, and FDA regulations.
 The identification of new side effects from Inbrija or any other marketed drug products, or side effects from those products that are more frequent or severe than in the past, could harm our business by leading to a significant decrease in sales or to the withdrawal of marketing approval in the U.S., EU and/or other jurisdictions.
 Based on our clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions with Inbrija (at least 5% and greater than placebo) include cough, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea and discolored sputum. We constantly monitor Inbrija adverse event reports for signals regarding potential additional adverse events.
 If we or others identify previously unknown side effects, if known side effects are more frequent or severe than in the past, or if we or others detect unexpected safety signals for Inbrija or any products perceived to be similar to Inbrija, then in any of these circumstances:
 •we may decide to, or be required to, send product warning letters or field alerts to physicians, pharmacists and hospitals; 
 •we may be required to make product label changes; for example, in September 2020, we updated the Inbrija label to add “sensation of choking immediately following administration” as a potential adverse reaction;
 •healthcare practitioners, regulatory authorities, third-party payers or patients may perceive or conclude that the risks associated with use of Inbrija outweigh the benefits, which could cause regulatory authorities such as the FDA or authorities in the EU to seek to suspend, vary or revoke Inbrija’s regulatory approvals or impact the availability of adequate reimbursement by third-party payers or reimbursement authorities;
 •we may be required to reformulate the product, conduct additional preclinical or clinical studies, or make changes in labeling or changes to or re-approvals of manufacturing facilities;
 •regulatory authorities such as the FDA or those in the EU may take additional risk mitigation measures, such as imposing a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (in the U.S.) or requiring an updated risk mitigation plan, detailing additional requirements to be fulfilled to manage risks (in the EU); 
 •our reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and
 •government investigations and lawsuits, including class-action lawsuits, may be brought against us.
 The above occurrences could impair our business by harming or possibly preventing sales of Inbrija, causing sales to fall below projections, and increasing our expenses. The same risks apply to our other marketed product Ampyra.


Regulatory approval of our products could be withdrawn and our business could be harmed if we fail to comply with safety and adverse event monitoring, documentation, investigation and reporting requirements.
 Under FDA and EU rules and regulations, we are required to monitor the safety of Inbrija and Ampyra, as applicable, and, in the case of Ampyra inform healthcare professionals about the risks of drug-associated seizures with Ampyra. We are required to document and investigate reports of adverse events, and to report them to the FDA and EU authorities in accordance with regulatory timelines based on the severity and expectedness of any adverse events. These requirements are applicable to all medicinal products marketed in the relevant territory, including Inbrija and Ampyra. Failure to make timely safety reports and to establish and maintain related records could result in the withdrawal of marketing authorization or other regulatory action, civil actions against us, or criminal or financial penalties, any of which could harm our business. If specialty pharmacies, promotional partners, distributors, or collaborators fail timely to report adverse events and product complaints to us, or if we do not meet the requirements for safety reporting, our business may be harmed.
 We are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities related to other regulatory requirements that apply to drugs manufactured or distributed by us.
 If we receive a notice of inspectional observations or deficiencies from the FDA or from foreign regulatory authorities, we may be required to undertake corrective and preventive actions in order to address the relevant regulatory authority’s concerns, which could be expensive and time-consuming to complete and could impose additional burdens and expenses. Failure to adequately address any such concerns could expose us to enforcement and a range of potential sanctions.
In addition, our third-party suppliers’ drug product manufacturing sites are subject to inspection by the FDA. Some of these sites have been inspected by the FDA and could be inspected by the FDA in the future. If the FDA inspects the process validation efforts and manufacturing process at these sites, the FDA might find what it considers to be deficiencies in the manufacturing process or process validation efforts, which could negatively impact the availability of product supply or, in the case of a potential new product, delay or prevent commercial launch of that product. Our third-party suppliers’ drug manufacturing sites may also be subject to inspection by FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. We face similar risks to our business if those third-party manufacturers are unable to comply with FDA or foreign regulatory requirements. We and our third-party suppliers are generally required to maintain compliance with cGMPs and are subject to inspections by the FDA or comparable authorities in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. This may be made more complex in certain circumstances if we do not have contracts with suppliers, such as in the case of Inbrija, where we currently do not have a contract with the supplier of levodopa, the active pharmaceutical ingredient. In addition, the FDA and other relevant regulatory authorities must approve certain changes to our suppliers or manufacturing methods. If we or our third-party suppliers cannot demonstrate ongoing cGMP compliance, we may be required to withdraw or recall products and interrupt commercial supply of our products. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of our third-party suppliers, to pass regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties, shut-down of manufacturing facilities, or other civil or criminal sanctions. Non-compliance could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue, and damage our reputation. In addition, a delay or interruption in supply of our products could lead to claims against us by our distributors and collaborators to whom we are obligated to supply product.
 Even if our suppliers or manufacturing methods are in compliance with applicable requirements, we may encounter problems with the manufacture of our products. To investigate and/or resolve these problems, we may be required to withdraw or recall products and interrupt commercial supply of our products. These events could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue, damage our reputation, and potentially lead to claims against us by distributors or collaborators to whom we are obligated to supply product. If we learn of certain reported problems with our products, we are required to submit field alert reports to the FDA and quality defect reports to the relevant EU authorities, such as the EMA, and we are required to investigate the causes of the reported problems. Issues identified in field alerts could lead to product recalls and interruption of supplies, which in turn could harm our business.
 Also, the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act requires that our manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers, take certain actions when product in their possession or control is suspect product, meaning there is reason to believe the product is: counterfeit; diverted; stolen; intentionally adulterated such that the product would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans; is the subject of a fraudulent transaction; or appears otherwise unfit for distribution such that the product would be reasonably likely to result in serious adverse health consequences to humans. The suspect product is required to be quarantined while an investigation is promptly conducted to determine whether the product is illegitimate, meaning credible evidence shows that it meets any of the above criteria. If a product is deemed an illegitimate

product, additional requirements apply such as notifying the FDA and all immediate trading partners in the supply chain within 24 hours and quarantining the product until it is dispositioned. Similar requirements exist under EU law, particularly pursuant to the Falsified Medicines Directive (Directive 2011/62/EU). The notification, quarantine and/or dispositioning of product during an investigation could impact product availability for commercial distribution and harm our business.
 We rely on specialty pharmacies to dispense our products, deliver customer support, and provide us with related services, and our business could be harmed and we could be subject to liabilities if these services are performed inadequately or in a manner that does not comply with applicable laws and regulations.
 A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in the dispensing of injectable, infused, or certain other medications typically for complex or chronic conditions, including Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis, which often require a high level of patient education and ongoing management. Most of our Inbrija and Ampyra sales are sold through specialty pharmacies, and sales of these products are highly dependent on the performance of these specialty pharmacies.
 The use of specialty pharmacies involves risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these specialty pharmacies:
 •do not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories or the number of patients who are using Inbrija or Ampyra;
 •fail to provide timely and accurate information regarding product adverse events or product complaints;
 •fail to properly administer copay mitigation programs;
 •do not effectively dispense or support Inbrija or Ampyra;
 •reduce their efforts or discontinue dispensing or supporting Inbrija or Ampyra;
 •do not devote the resources necessary to dispense Inbrija or Ampyra in a manner that meets patient needs;
 •are unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or
 •lose the required licenses to distribute drugs; or cease operations.
 If our specialty pharmacies do not fulfill their contractual obligations to us or fail to adequately dispense our products and deliver customer support, our product sales and business could be harmed or we could be subject to legal or regulatory liabilities or sanctions.
 Furthermore, arrangements between manufacturers and specialty pharmacies can be subject to government scrutiny and challenge under fraud and abuse laws if not structured properly.
We are dependent on third parties such as through collaboration and distribution agreements to develop and commercialize products outside of the U.S.
 We do not have the capabilities to develop and commercialize products outside of the U.S. without reliance on another party. Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen under a license and collaboration agreement that we entered into in June 2009. In 2021, we entered into distribution and supply agreements with Esteve for commercialization of Inbrija in Germany and Spain and with Biopas for Commercialization of Inbrija in Latin America, and we are relying on Esteve and Biopas, among other things, to obtain necessary country-specific approvals needed for the sale of and reimbursement for Inbrija in those countries. We expect that we will need to enter into additional collaborations or distribution arrangements with third parties to commercialize Inbrija in other countries. We would similarly need to rely on third parties for developing and commercializing any other potential products outside of the U.S. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to identify suitable collaborators or distributors in addition to our existing agreements, or that we will be able to enter into additional collaboration or distribution agreements with third parties on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our inability to identify collaborators or distributors and enter into agreements with them could harm or delay our efforts to develop and commercialize Inbrija or other potential products outside of the U.S.
 Our dependence on third parties such as collaborators and distributors for development and commercialization of products outside the U.S., does and will subject us to a number of risks, including:


•we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators or distributors devote to the development or commercialization of product candidates or to their marketing and distribution;
 •our collaborators or distributors may fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to the development, or commercialization of products or product candidates;
 •our collaborators or distributors may not be successful in their efforts to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or adequate product reimbursement in a timely manner, or at all, as discussed further in these risk factors;
 •disputes may arise between us and our collaborators or distributors that result in the delay or termination of the research, development, or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management's attention and resources;
 •our collaborators or distributors may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;
 •our collaborators or distributors may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;
 •business combinations or significant changes in our collaborator's or distributor’s business strategy may also adversely affect a collaborator's willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement;
 •our collaborator or distributor could independently move forward with a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors;
 •collaborations or distribution arrangements may be terminated or allowed to expire, which would delay the development and may increase the cost of developing our product candidates;
 •our collaborators or distributors may experience financial difficulties; and
 •our ability to enter into additional collaboration agreements or distribution arrangements may be limited by the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture that governs our convertible senior secured notes due 2024.
 While we seek contractual terms and conditions intended to protect our rights and mitigate our risk relating to circumstances listed above, there can be no assurance that these terms will provide us with adequate rights and remedies, and actions required to enforce such rights could be costly and time consuming.
 Our collaborators and distributors will need to obtain and maintain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions where they seek to market or are currently marketing our products.
 In order to market our products in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions, separate regulatory approvals must be obtained and maintained and numerous and varying regulatory requirements must be complied with. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical and non-clinical testing as well as additional regulatory agency inspections. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. We and our collaborators or distributors may fail to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, individual countries, within the EU or elsewhere, may require additional steps after regulatory approval to gain access to national markets, such as agreements with pricing authorities and other agencies, that may harm the ability of us or our collaborators or distributors to market and sell our products outside the U.S. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals to commercialize Inbrija, Fampyra or other products or product candidates in foreign markets could materially harm our business prospects. In addition, we may face adverse legal and business consequences if our collaborators or distributors fail to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
 We do not have any active drug development programs and may never commercialize any new products.
 Because of our limited financial resources, we previously suspended work on all research and development programs, and deferred consideration of further investment. Furthermore, as part of our financial management efforts, we are allowing the intellectual property associated with certain of these programs to lapse. Future growth of our business may depend, in

part, on our ability to identify new product development candidates, complete preclinical development of these product candidates, and advance them to and through clinical trials.
Even if we were to recommence investment in drug development programs, our suspended programs are all early-stage and either have not advanced to clinical trials or are only in Phase 1 trials. Early-stage product candidates in particular would require significant development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory clearances and substantial additional investment before they could be commercialized, if at all. Pharmaceutical research and development programs are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with drug development described elsewhere in these risk factors and in general experience a high rate of failure. For example, we may fail to identify promising product candidates, product candidates may fail to be safe and effective in preclinical tests or clinical trials, or we may have inadequate financial or other resources to pursue discovery and development efforts for new product candidates. Also, as a result of reductions in force, we previously terminated substantially all of our research and development and clinical development workforce, and accordingly we lack personnel necessary to advance development programs unless and until we can hire qualified replacements.
 Our research and development programs have included exploration of opportunities for proprietary products, in addition to Inbrija, in which inhaled delivery of medicine using our ARCUS drug delivery technology can provide a significant therapeutic benefit to patients. Although our suspension of research and development investment impacted these efforts, we continue to discuss potential ARCUS collaborations with other companies that express interest in formulating their novel molecules using ARCUS, and have already performed feasibility studies for a number of these opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that these companies will want to further pursue, or would agree to commercially reasonable terms and conditions for, such collaborations. Even if we enter into an ARCUS collaboration for a third-party molecule, the development of the ARCUS formulation would be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with drug development described elsewhere in these risk factors and may never be commercialized. For example, the third party could discontinue the development program for financial reasons, or safety or efficacy concerns could prevent the ARCUS formulation from receiving regulatory approval.
 Drug products in development must undergo rigorous clinical testing, the results of which are uncertain and could substantially delay or prevent us from bringing them to market.
 Before any product candidate can receive regulatory approval, the product candidate must be subjected to extensive clinical testing in humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, EU regulatory authorities and other regulatory agencies. Clinical trials of new product candidates sufficient to obtain regulatory marketing approval are expensive and take years to complete, and the outcome of such trials is uncertain. Clinical development of any product candidate that we or a collaboration partner determine to take into clinical trials may be curtailed, redirected, delayed or eliminated at any time for some or all of the following reasons:
 •negative or ambiguous results regarding the efficacy of the product candidate;
 •undesirable side effects that delay or extend the trials, or other unforeseen or undesirable safety issues that make the product candidate not medically or commercially viable;
 •inability to locate, recruit and qualify a sufficient number of patients for our trials;
 •difficulty in determining meaningful end points or other measurements of success in our clinical trials;
 •regulatory delays or other regulatory actions, including changes in regulatory requirements by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries;
 •difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of our product candidates, or where applicable comparator product or other ancillary materials needed, manufactured under cGMP;
 •delays, suspension or termination of the trials imposed by us or our collaboration partner, an independent institutional review board (or ethics committee), or a data safety monitoring board, or clinical holds placed upon the trials by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities in other countries;
 •approval by FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities of new drugs that are more effective than our or our collaboration partner’s product candidates;
 •change in the focus of our development efforts or a re-evaluation of our or our collaboration partner’s clinical development strategy; and


•change in our or our collaboration partner’s financial position.
 A delay in or termination of any of a clinical development program that we or a collaboration partner may conduct in the future could harm our business.
 Clinical trials are subject to oversight by institutional review boards (or similar ethics committees), data safety monitoring boards, the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries to ensure compliance with good clinical practice requirements, as well as other requirements for the protection of clinical trial participants. If we were to conduct any clinical trials, we would depend, in part, on third-party laboratories and medical institutions to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials and other third-party organizations to perform data collection and analysis, all of which must maintain both good laboratory and good clinical practices required by regulators. If any of those standards are not complied with in a clinical trial, the resulting data from the clinical trial may not be usable or we, an institutional review board, the FDA or a similar regulatory authority in another country may suspend or terminate a trial, which would severely delay our development and possibly end the development of the product candidate.
 If we proceed with research and development programs, we will rely on third-party contract research organizations, medical centers and others to perform preclinical and non-clinical testing and clinical trials, and research and development programs could be harmed if these third parties do not perform in an acceptable and legally compliant manner.
 If we recommence investment in research and development programs, we would rely on clinical investigators, third-party contract research organizations, and consultants to perform some or all of the functions associated with preclinical and non-clinical testing and clinical trials. Additionally, we have historically conducted clinical trials in the U.S., Canada, and to a lesser extent other jurisdictions, particularly Europe. Because we have limited experience conducting clinical trials outside the U.S. and Canada, we would place even greater reliance on third-party contract research organizations to manage, monitor and carry out clinical trials in these other jurisdictions. The failure of any of these parties to perform in an acceptable and timely manner in the future, including in accordance with any applicable U.S. or foreign regulatory requirements, such as good clinical and laboratory practices, or preclinical testing or clinical trial protocols, could cause a delay or other adverse effect on preclinical or non-clinical testing or clinical trials and ultimately on the timely advancement of research and development programs. Similarly, we would rely on medical centers to conduct clinical trials, and if they fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or clinical trial protocols, our research and development programs could be harmed.
 If we or our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, collaborators or distributors market products in a manner that violates healthcare fraud and abuse laws, if we or any of them violate false claims laws, or if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid drug rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, or other applicable legal requirements, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or additional reimbursement requirements and sanctions, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
 The distribution, sale and promotion of drug and biological products in the U.S. and in foreign markets are subject to numerous laws and regulations. In the U.S., this includes regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-kickback and fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, as amended, the False Claims Act, as amended, and are affected by the privacy regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended, and similar state laws. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of safe harbors under these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. All of these activities are also subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws and regulations.
 The U.S. federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, patients, and formulary managers on the other. Industry relationships with specialty pharmacies have also been scrutinized under these provisions. There are several statutory

exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, but the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for exemptions or safe harbors. Practices that involve remuneration for performing activities that we believe are legitimate in support of the distribution of our products may be subject to scrutiny, particularly if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor, and they may be found to be improperly intended to induce or facilitate the prescribing, purchasing or recommending of our products even though we believe these practices to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Federal false claims laws in the U.S. prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. By statute, a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute may serve as the basis for a false claim under the false claims act. Numerous pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing kickbacks, such as free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees, and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; and engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.
 Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include requirements to make payments to government-funded health plans to correct for insufficient rebates paid by us or overpayments made to us, civil monetary penalties, exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. We may also be subject to a corporate integrity agreement, deferred prosecution agreement, or similar arrangement.
 Under the federal Sunshine Act, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to collect information on payments or other transfers of value made to “covered recipients,” which are defined as physicians, teaching hospitals, physician assistants and advance practice nurses. Similarly, the Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to annually report samples of prescription drugs requested by and distributed to healthcare providers. The law does not state whether these disclosures regarding samples will be made publicly available, and the FDA has not provided any guidance. If we fail to submit these reports, or if the reports we submit are not accurate, we could be subject to significant penalties.
 We participate in the federal Medicaid drug rebate program established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as well as several state supplemental rebate programs. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, we pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for utilization of our products that are reimbursed by those programs. Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid drug rebate program extend comparable discounts to qualified purchasers under the Public Health Service Act pharmaceutical pricing program, which requires us to sell our products to certain customers at prices lower than we otherwise might be able to charge. The minimum basic Medicaid rebate for branded prescription drugs is 23.1% of average manufacturer price, and pharmaceutical manufacturers must pay states rebates on prescription drugs dispensed to Medicaid managed care enrollees. In addition, manufacturers must pay an additional Medicaid rebate on “line extensions” (such as extended-release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products or products where the average manufacturer price has increased faster than the inflation rate.
 For products to be made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule, additional pricing laws and requirements apply, as do certain obligations imposed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended (VHCA), we are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies, including the Veterans Administration, the Department of Defense (DOD), the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities, in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicare and Medicaid. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
 Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under federal and state false claims laws for manipulating information submitted to the Medicaid drug rebate program or for knowingly submitting or using allegedly inaccurate pricing information in connection with federal pricing and discount programs.
 Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The laws and regulations governing the calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us or our contractors, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. Our methodologies for calculating these prices could be challenged under false claims laws or other laws. We or our contractors could make a mistake in calculating reported prices and required discounts, revisions to those prices and

discounts, or determining whether a revision is necessary, which could result in retroactive rebates (and interest and penalties, if any). Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. If we make these mistakes or if governmental agencies make these changes, we could face, in addition to prosecution under federal and state false claims laws, substantial liability and civil monetary penalties, exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines or imprisonment, and prosecutors may impose a corporate integrity agreement, deferred prosecution agreement, or similar arrangement.
 Under the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, as amended, drug manufacturers are required to provide a 70% discount on prescriptions for branded products filled while the beneficiary is in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the “donut hole.” In addition, the ACA imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The fee (which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes) is based on the manufacturer’s market share of sales of branded drugs and biologics (excluding orphan drugs) to, or pursuant to coverage under, specified U.S. government programs.
 Outside the U.S., the distribution, sale and promotion of our products is subject to a variety of rules and requirements. In the EU, these vary from country to country, and we must comply with all applicable rules in each relevant market. In many jurisdictions, these include both general anti-bribery rules and specific rules prohibiting the provision of inducements to healthcare professionals under medicines advertising laws and self-regulatory codes of conduct and guidelines. In many EU countries, the applicable industry self-regulatory codes of conduct require companies to disclose publicly any transfers of value to healthcare professionals or healthcare organizations, and disclosure laws comparable to the U.S. Sunshine Act have been adopted in some EU member states. Failure to adhere to such rules and regulations could result in any number of possible sanctions, including fines and criminal prosecutions as well as reputational damage to us and our products.
 In the U.S., we supplement our own sales activities with the services of contract sales representatives and may enter into promotional partnerships or other similar arrangements. Outside the U.S., we rely on collaborators and distributors to market our products. Although these are independent companies, under applicable laws and regulations we can in some cases be held directly responsible for the acts or omissions of these companies because they are marketing our products. While we seek contractual terms and conditions intended to protect our rights and mitigate our risk relating to the misconduct of other parties, contractual rights would not protect us against governmental prosecution or enforcement, there can be no assurance that contractual financial remedies would be adequate to cover associated liabilities, and the actions required to protect against enforcement actions or to enforce such rights could be costly and time consuming.
 Legislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 The current administration has indicated an interest in measures designed to lower drug costs and there continues to be political pressure at both the U.S. federal and state levels related to drug pricing and drug transparency that could result in legislative or administrative actions, or at a minimum continued scrutiny. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 Healthcare systems outside the U.S. are varied and in the EU differ from country to country. In general, in many EU countries there is a growing pressure to lower overall expenditure on medicines and a range of government initiatives are in place or being proposed with this aim. These include measures to lower the prices of medicines, restrictions on reimbursement, and a range of substitution, procurement and prescribing initiatives. The state of healthcare legislation and regulation in the EU is also unclear and difficult to predict.
 Changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our costs could also harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.
 Our existing or potential products may not be commercially viable in the U.S. if we fail to obtain or maintain an adequate level of reimbursement for these products by Medicaid, Medicare or other third-party payers.
Our ability to sell our products in the U.S. and be profitable is substantially dependent on third-party payers, such as government or government-sponsored health administrative authorities, including Medicaid and Medicare Parts B and D, private health insurers and other such organizations, agreeing to reimburse patients for the cost of our products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved drug products, including Inbrija. Third-party payers are

increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services and their reimbursement practices may affect the price levels for Inbrija or other potential products we may develop in the future. Our business could be materially harmed if the Medicaid program, Medicare program or other third-party payers were to deny reimbursement for our products or provide reimbursement only on unfavorable terms. Our business could also be harmed if the Medicaid program, Medicare program or other reimbursing bodies or payers limit the indications for which our products will be reimbursed to a smaller set of indications than we believe is appropriate or limit the circumstances under which our products will be reimbursed to a smaller set of circumstances than we believe is appropriate.
 Third-party payers frequently require that drug companies negotiate agreements with them that provide discounts or rebates from list or wholesale prices. We have agreed to provide such discounts and rebates to some third-party payers in relation to Inbrija and Ampyra, and we expect that obtaining agreements with other third-party payers to provide access to, and reimburse patients for, our products, if possible, will similarly require that we provide such discounts and rebates. We have experienced increasing pressure to offer larger discounts and discounts to a greater number of third-party payers to maintain acceptable reimbursement levels and access for patients at copay levels that are reasonable. There is no guarantee that we would be able to negotiate agreements with third-party payers at price levels that are profitable to us, or at all. Many third-party payers have implemented utilization management techniques for Inbrija and Ampyra, such as prior authorization and/or quantity limits. Patients who cannot meet the conditions of prior authorizations are often prevented from obtaining the prescribed medication, because they cannot afford to pay for the medication without reimbursement. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining reimbursement for our products at acceptable levels, or if reimbursement for our products by third-party payers is subject to overly restrictive utilization management, our business will be harmed. In addition, if our competitors reduce the prices of their products, or otherwise demonstrate that they are better or more cost effective than our products, this may result in a greater level of reimbursement for their products relative to our products, which would reduce our sales and harm our results of operations. Both federal healthcare programs and commercial insurers are increasingly conditioning coverage, formulary placement, and/or reimbursement rates on the ability of a manufacturer to present favorable health economics and outcomes data.
 The Medicare Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit is provided primarily through private entities, which attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. These negotiations increase pressure to lower prescription drug prices or increase rebate payments to offset price. While the law specifically prohibits the U.S. government from interfering in price negotiations between manufacturers and Medicare drug plan sponsors, some members of the U.S. Congress support legislation that would permit the U.S. government to use its enormous purchasing power to demand discounts from pharmaceutical companies. While this is a priority for the current U.S. administration, we cannot predict whether such legislation will pass. In addition, the ACA contains triggers for Congressional consideration of cost containment measures for Medicare in the event Medicare cost increases exceed a certain level. These cost containment measures could include limitations on prescription drug prices. The ACA requires drug manufacturers to provide a 70% discount on prescriptions for branded products filled while the beneficiary is in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the “donut hole.” Legislative or regulatory revisions to the Medicare Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit, as well as additional healthcare legislation that may be enacted at a future date, could reduce our sales and harm our results of operations.
 The success of our existing and potential products in the EU substantially depends on achieving adequate government reimbursement.
 The commercial success in the EU of products approved there primarily depends on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement because, in many European countries, patients may not have access to prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In addition, participation in pricing and reimbursement procedures and negotiating prices with government authorities can delay commercialization. Even if reimbursement is available, reimbursement policies may negatively impact revenue from sales of our products and therefore our ability or that of Biogen, our collaborator for Fampyra, Esteve, our distribution partner for Inbrija, or any future collaborator or distributor to sell our products on a profitable basis. Furthermore, cross-border imports from lower-priced markets (parallel imports) into higher-priced markets could harm sales of products by us or our collaborators or distributors and exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 Governments in a number of international markets have announced or implemented measures aimed at reducing healthcare costs to constrain the overall level of government expenditures. This includes some of the largest markets in the EU, where Biogen markets Fampyra and Esteve has agreed to distribute Inbrija, and where we may seek to market Inbrija through other collaborators or distributors. The measures vary by country and include, among other things, mandatory rebates and discounts, clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness assessments, reimbursement limitations and reference pricing, price

reductions and suspensions on pricing increases on pharmaceuticals. These measures may negatively impact net revenue from Biogen’s sales of Fampyra and therefore both the timing of when we receive any further royalty revenue from Biogen. Furthermore, the adverse financial impact of these measures in any particular country, in addition to related reimbursement or regulatory constraints, could prevent the commercial launch or continued commercialization of Inbrija or Fampyra in that country.
 The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, generally referred to as “Brexit,” could have adverse effects on our business.
 As of January 1, 2021, the UK formally left the EU and the UK and EU are now operating separate pharmaceutical regulatory regimes. The UK and EU announced on December 24, 2020 that they had agreed on a Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) to govern their future relationship. The TCA sets out the arrangements for trade of goods, including medicines and medical devices, which aims to ensure goods continue to flow between the EU and the UK and also has implications for product regulation and mutual recognition.
 Following the exit of the UK from the EU, we were granted a grandfathered Marketing Authorization (MA) for Inbrija by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK that was made effective in January 2021 and formally approved in November 2021. In order to maintain the grandfathered marketing authorization in the UK and not trigger the sunset clause, we will need to begin marketing in the UK by January 2024. We will also be required to retain the services of a qualified person for pharmacovigilance. Moreover, if we are to market Inbrija in the UK in the future, the movement of finished pharmaceutical products into the UK is treated as an import from a third country post-Brexit. The UK has made permanent the decision to unilaterally waive batch testing requirements for imports of products from the EU.
In addition, although the TCA provides some clarity regarding the future relationship between the EU and UK, the impact of Brexit on the fiscal, monetary and regulatory landscape in the UK remains uncertain, and it could have a material impact on its economy and the future growth of its various industries, including the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it remains unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the UK from the EU may have and how such withdrawal would affect us.
 If our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer or more convenient than our approved products, or obtain marketing approval before we obtain approval of future products, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.
 Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense and is expected to increase. Many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, are engaged in research, development, and/or marketing of therapeutics for various neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.
 Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective, safer or more convenient than our products or the ones we have under development or that render our approved or proposed products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, our competitors may achieve product commercialization before we do. If any of our competitors develops a product that is more effective, safer or more convenient for patients, or is able to obtain FDA approval for commercialization before we do, we may not be able to achieve market acceptance for our products, which would harm our ability to generate revenues and recover the substantial development costs we have incurred and will continue to incur.
 Our products may be subject to competition from lower-priced versions of such products and competing products imported into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico and other countries where there are government price controls or other market dynamics that cause the products to be priced lower.
 Inbrija/Parkinson’s Disease. Inbrija competes against other therapies approved for intermittent, or as needed, use that aim to specifically address Parkinson’s disease symptoms. Apokyn, an injectable formulation of apomorphine, is approved for the treatment of OFF episodes. Apokyn was approved for this use in the U.S. in 2004 and in Europe in 1993, and in 2022 the FDA approved a generic version of Apokyn. Also, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. markets a sublingual, or under the tongue, formulation of apomorphine branded as Kynmobi that is competitive with Inbrija.
 The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease is oral carbidopa/levodopa, but oral medication can be associated with wide variability in the timing and the amount of absorption and there are significant challenges in creating a

regimen that consistently maintains therapeutic effects as Parkinson’s disease progresses. Inbrija may face competition from therapies that can limit the occurrence of OFF periods. Approaches to achieve consistent levodopa plasma concentrations include new formulations of carbidopa/levodopa, such as extended-release and intestinal infusions, and therapies that prolong the effect of levodopa. Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. markets RYTARY, an extended-release formulation of oral carbidopa/levodopa, and extended-release formulations of oral and patch carbidopa/levodopa are being developed by others including Intec Pharma and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation. Also, AbbVie Inc. has developed a continuous administration of a gel-containing levodopa through a tube that is surgically implanted into the intestine. This therapy, known as Duopa, has been approved by the FDA and is approved in the EU.
 One or more of our competitors may utilize their expertise in pulmonary delivery of drugs to develop and obtain approval for pulmonary delivery products that may compete with Inbrija and any other ARCUS drug delivery technology product candidates that we may develop in the future. These competitors may include smaller companies such as Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pulmatrix, Inc. and Vectura Group plc and larger companies such as Allergan, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, MannKind Corporation, and Novartis AG, among others. If approved, our product candidates may face competition in the target commercial areas for these pulmonary delivery products. Also, we are aware that at least one company, Impel Neuropharma, is developing intranasally-delivered levodopa therapies which, if approved, might compete with Inbrija.
 Ampyra/MS. Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from several generic versions of Ampyra. Additional manufacturers may market generic versions of Ampyra, and we expect our Ampyra sales will continue to decline over time.
 Current disease management approaches to MS are classified either as relapse management, disease course management, or symptom management approaches. For relapse management, the majority of neurologists treat sudden and severe relapses with a four-day course of intravenous high-dose corticosteroids. Many of these corticosteroids are available generically. For disease course management, there are a number of FDA-approved MS therapies that seek to modify the immune system. These treatments attempt to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations or slow the accumulation of physical disability for people with certain types of MS, though their precise mechanisms of action are not known. These products include Avonex, Tysabri, Plegridy and Tecfidera from Biogen, Zinbryta from Biogen and AbbVie, Betaseron from Bayer AG, Copaxone from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Rebif from Merck Serono, Gilenya and Extavia from Novartis AG, Aubagio and Lemtrada from Genzyme Corporation (a Sanofi company), Glatopa from Sandoz International GmbH (a Novartis AG company), Rituxan from F. Hoffman-La Roche AG, Ponvory from Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, and Zeposia from Bristol-MyersSquibb.
 Several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, are involved in research and/or product development for various neurological diseases, including MS. Other companies also have products in clinical development, including products approved for other indications in MS, to address improvement of walking ability in people with MS. Furthermore, several companies are engaged in developing products that include novel immune system approaches and cell therapy approaches to remyelination for the treatment of people with MS. These programs are in early stages of development and may compete in the future with Ampyra or some of our product candidates. In addition, in certain circumstances, pharmacists are not prohibited from formulating certain drug compounds to fill prescriptions on an individual patient basis, which is referred to as compounding. We are aware that at present compounded dalfampridine is used by some people with MS and it is possible that some people will want to continue to use compounded formulations even though Ampyra and generic versions of Ampyra are commercially available.
 State pharmaceutical compliance and reporting requirements may expose us to regulatory and legal action by state governments or other government authorities.
 Many states have enacted laws governing the licensure of companies that manufacture and/or distribute prescription drugs, although the scope of these laws varies, particularly where out-of-state distributors are concerned. We have obtained licenses in all of the jurisdictions in which we believe we are required to be licensed. However, there can be no assurance that one or more of these states will not take action under these licensure laws.
 Several states have also enacted legislation regarding promotional and other activities conducted by pharmaceutical companies. The specifics of these laws vary, but in general they require companies to establish marketing compliance programs; disclose various sales and marketing expenses and pricing information; refrain from providing certain gifts or other payments to healthcare providers; and/or ensure that their sales representatives in that state are licensed. Some states, including California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Vermont, and the District of Columbia, have passed laws

of varying scope that ban or limit the provision of gifts, meals and certain other payments to healthcare providers and/or impose reporting and disclosure requirements upon pharmaceutical companies pertaining to drug pricing, payments and/or costs associated with pharmaceutical marketing, advertising and other promotional activities. Other states also have laws that regulate, directly or indirectly, various pharmaceutical sales and marketing activities, and new legislation is being considered in many states.
 Many of the state requirements continue to evolve, and the manner in which they will be enforced going forward is uncertain. In some cases, the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements are unclear. We are continually updating our compliance infrastructure and standard operating procedures to comply with such laws, but we cannot eliminate the risk created by these uncertainties. Unless we are in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement action, fines and other penalties, including government orders to stop selling drugs into a state until properly licensed, and could receive adverse publicity.
 Our inability to attract and retain key management and other personnel, or maintain access to expert advisors, may hinder our ability to execute our business plan.
 We are highly dependent on the services of Dr. Ron Cohen, our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as the other principal members of our management and scientific, regulatory, manufacturing and commercial personnel. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel with the knowledge and experience needed for these and other areas of our business. We do not maintain "key man" life insurance policies on the lives of our officers, directors or employees.
 We face intense competition in our hiring efforts with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations. We may be unable to attract or retain qualified personnel because their competitive salaries and other compensation may increase to levels that we are unwilling or unable to provide. In addition, material adverse developments with our business, including the 2017 adverse patent decision relating to our Orange Book-listed Ampyra patents, the termination or suspension of research and development programs, four reductions in force since 2017, and the current progress of our Inbrija commercial launch, may impede our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We have recently experienced workforce attrition in various functions across our business, which may be attributable to one or more of the factors described above or other factors. Our efforts to adjust our operations with the reduced workforce may not be successful in preventing disruption to our business, and with the reduced workforce we lack redundancy in important functions across our business. We are increasingly relying on the services of contract sales representatives or other third-party marketing support in response to substantial sales force attrition. Further loss of one or more of our key employees, additional loss of multiple employees in particular functions, and/or our inability to attract replacement or additional qualified personnel could substantially impair our ability to operate our business and implement our business plan, particularly our efforts to successfully commercialize Inbrija. Also, due to the recent attrition, four reductions in force since 2017, and the 2021 sale of our Chelsea manufacturing operations, we believe we lack personnel needed for, and would need to hire replacements before continuing with, research and development and clinical programs. Our inability to attract qualified replacements needed for research and development and clinical programs could substantially impair our ability to advance those programs, if we determine to make further investments in those programs.
We also have scientific, medical, clinical, marketing and other advisors who assist us in our research and development, clinical, and commercial strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. Similarly, they may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development and commercialization of products that may compete with ours. Burkhard Blank, M.D., our former Chief Medical Officer, transitioned into a consulting role effective January 1, 2022, and, to our knowledge, has commenced a full time role as an executive at another biopharmaceutical company. We cannot be sure whether and for how long we will have continuing access to Dr. Blank’s expertise for our business, and currently we have not identified any individual with comparable expertise to replace Dr. Blank.
 We and our third-party contract manufacturers must comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs or liabilities.
 Biopharmaceutical research and development activities are subject to numerous and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those which govern laboratory procedures and the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment, remediation and disposal of hazardous substances. We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future such laws and regulations, which may also impair

research and development efforts that we may be engaged in. We cannot completely avoid the risk of contamination or injury in connection with research and development activities, and in such cases of contamination or injury, or in cases of failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could be held liable, and in some cases strictly liable, for any resulting damages.
Also, the existence, investigation and/or remediation of contamination at properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us may result in costs, fines or other penalties. Furthermore, our third-party manufacturers are subject to the same or similar environmental, health and safety laws and regulations as those to which we are subject. It is possible that if our third-party manufacturers fail to operate in compliance with the applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or properly dispose of wastes associated with our products, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and/or experience a disruption in the manufacture and supply of our product candidates or products. Any such liability may result in substantial civil or criminal fines, penalties or other sanctions, which could exceed our assets and resources, as well as reputational harm.
 Although we assigned our Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing facility lease to Catalent in February 2021, we remain responsible for certain contingent environmental liabilities should an issue arise in the future relating to the operation of the facility prior to the assignment.
 Risks related to our intellectual property
 If we cannot protect, maintain and, if necessary, enforce our intellectual property, our ability to develop and commercialize our products will be severely limited.
 Our success will depend in part on our and our licensors' ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patent and trademark protection for the technologies, compounds and products, if any, resulting from our licenses and research and development programs. Without protection for the intellectual property we use or intend to use, other companies could offer substantially identical products for sale without incurring the sizable discovery, research, development and licensing costs that we have incurred. Our ability to recover these expenditures and realize profits upon the sale of products could be diminished.
 We have patent portfolios relating to Inbrija and our ARCUS drug delivery technology. For some of our proprietary technologies, for example our ARCUS drug delivery technology, we rely on a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property also includes copyrights and a portfolio of trademarks.
 The process of obtaining patents and trademarks can be time consuming and expensive with no certainty of success. Even if we spend the necessary time and money, a patent or trademark may not issue, it may not issue in a timely manner, or it may not have sufficient scope or strength to protect the technology it was intended to protect or to provide us with any commercial advantage. We may never be certain that we were the first to develop the technology or that we were the first to file a patent application for the particular technology because patent applications are confidential until they are published, and publications in the scientific or patent literature lag behind actual discoveries. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights will remain uncertain if our pending patent applications are not allowed or issued for any reason or if we are unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable. Furthermore, third parties may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, duplicate some or all of our technologies, design around our patented technologies or challenge our issued patents or trademarks or the patents or trademarks of our licensors. For example, Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from several generic versions of Ampyra. Additional manufacturers may market generic versions of Ampyra, and we expect our Ampyra sales will continue to decline over time.
 Also, the validity of our patents can be challenged by third parties pursuant to procedures introduced by American Invents Act, specifically inter partes review and/or post grant review before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For example, in 2015, a hedge fund (acting with affiliated entities and individuals and proceeding under the name of the Coalition for Affordable Drugs) filed inter partes review (IPR) petitions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, challenging some of our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents. We successfully defended the patents in these proceedings, but this outcome did not affect the U.S. federal district court decision invalidating Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents as described above. IPR petitions could be filed in the future challenging our other patents for any of our programs.


Nullity actions with respect to Fampyra have been filed in Germany against both of the German national patents derived from EP 1732548 (the ‘548 patent) and EP 2377536 (the ‘536 patent) by ratiopharm GmbH, a generic manufacturer affiliated with Teva. In November 2021, a German court issued preliminary opinions in the ratiopharm case indicating that the claimed subject matter of the ‘548 patent lacked inventive step and the claimed subject matter of the ‘536 patent lacked novelty and inventive step. At oral hearings in February 2022 and April 2022, the German Patent Court dismissed ratiopharm’s action against the ‘536 patent and the ‘548 patent, respectively, as inadmissible because of ongoing formality proceedings relating to these patents in the European Patent Office. Ratiopharm has appealed the decision on the ‘536 patent but not the decision on the ‘548 patent, and could refile the nullity actions. On December 6, 2022, the German Federal Court of Justice held that ratiopharm’s ‘536 nullity action was admissible and remanded the case back to the German Federal Patent Court. On January 11, 2022, Stada Arzneimittel also filed a nullity action against the ‘536 patent, and on July 27, 2022, Teva GmbH also filed a nullity action against the ‘548 patent, both in the same court as the ratiopharm nullity actions. On January 27, 2023, the German Federal Patent Court issued a preliminary opinion in the ‘548 Teva nullity action that the claimed subject matter of the ‘548 patent lacked inventive step and scheduled a hearing for July 11, 2023. We are working with Biogen to vigorously defend these actions and enforce our patent rights. See Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this report for more information. Loss of patent rights or generic entry into the German and other markets will have a material adverse effect on royalty revenue from Biogen in the future.
 Patent litigation, IPR proceedings, and other legal proceedings usually involve complex legal and factual questions and require the devotion of significant financial resources and management time and attention. If we are not successful in protecting any of our intellectual property that is subject to such proceedings, we could lose Orange Book listed patents that protect our products and our business could be materially harmed. We can provide no assurance concerning the duration or the outcome of any such lawsuits and legal proceedings.
 We may initiate actions to protect our intellectual property and in any litigation in which our intellectual property or our licensors' intellectual property is asserted, a court may determine that the intellectual property is invalid or unenforceable. Even if the validity or enforceability of that intellectual property is upheld by a court, a court may not prevent alleged infringement on the grounds that such activity is not covered by, for example, the patent claims. In addition, effective intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries for a variety of legal and public policy reasons. From time to time we may receive notices from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Any litigation, whether to enforce our rights to use our or our licensors' patents or to defend against allegations that we infringe third-party rights, would be costly, time consuming, and may distract management from other important tasks.
 As is commonplace in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. To the extent our employees are involved in areas that are similar to those areas in which they were involved at their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees and/or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims, which could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and which could have an adverse effect on us, even if we are successful in defending such claims.
 We also rely in our business on trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information. For example, the know-how that forms the basis of our proprietary manufacturing process for the ARCUS technology and Inbrija manufacturing is substantially dependent on trade secret protection. Establishing our global supply agreement with Catalent required that we share this type of information with Catalent, and we may need to share similar information with others in the future in connection with development of backup or additional manufacturing needed for Inbrija commercialization. We seek to protect trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information, in part, through the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators, advisors and others, and in the case of Catalent by including various operational safeguards and confidentiality and other requirements in our global supply agreement with them. Nonetheless, those agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information, including our proprietary ARCUS technology, and prevent their unauthorized use or disclosure. To the extent that consultants, collaborators, key employees or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our proposed products, joint ownership may result, which could undermine the value of the intellectual property to us or disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such information which may not be resolved in our favor. The risk that other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or that our trade secrets such as our ARCUS technology become known or independently discovered by competitors, could harm us by enabling our competitors, who may have greater experience and financial resources, to copy or use our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the advancement of their products, methods or technologies. Policing unauthorized use of our or our licensors' intellectual property is difficult,

expensive and time-consuming, and we may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure.
 Our business could be harmed by requirements to publicly disclose our clinical trial data.
 There is an increasing trend across multiple jurisdictions, including the United States and the EU, towards requiring greater transparency, particularly in the area of clinical trial results. In many jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the EU, we are required to register most of our clinical trials as well as disclose summaries of the results of those clinical trials. Further requirements for transparency could result in the disclosure of data down to the individual patient level. In the EU, for example, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has since 2015 implemented a policy on transparency of clinical trial data submitted to the agency in applications for marketing authorization. These data traditionally were regarded as confidential commercial information not subject to disclosure. According to this policy, the EMA proactively publishes anonymized clinical data submitted by pharmaceutical companies to support their regulatory applications submitted after January 1, 2015 (subject to certain company redactions agreed with the EMA during the application review process). Possible redactions include commercially confidential information, identifiable information about study participants and study staff and patient level data (i.e., line listings including patient data against individual patient codes). The EMA plans to release patient level data in the future, but needs to address some data privacy concerns before doing so. The EMA may release clinical data submitted before this date on request, subject to us having the opportunity to make similar redactions. The precise implementation of the EMA’s policy remains in flux and subject to legal challenge. This could harm our business in a variety of ways, including for example through disclosure of our trade secret methodologies for clinical development of our products, and/or by potentially enabling competitors to use our clinical data to gain approvals for their own products in the same or other jurisdictions. Regardless of the precise details of the EMA’s policy, the trend across governments is for increased transparency, which could diminish our ability to protect our confidential commercial information.
 If third parties successfully claim that we infringe their patents or proprietary rights, our ability to continue to develop and successfully commercialize our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.
 Third parties may claim that we or our licensors or suppliers are infringing their patents or are misappropriating their proprietary information. In the event of a successful claim against us or our licensors or suppliers for infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of others relating to any of our marketed products or product candidates, we may be required to:
 •pay substantial damages;
 •stop using our technologies;
 •withdraw a product from the market;
 •stop certain research and development efforts;
 •significantly delay product commercialization activities;
 •develop non-infringing products or methods, which may not be feasible; and
 •obtain one or more licenses from third parties.
 In addition, from time to time, we may become aware of third parties who have, or claim to have, intellectual property rights covering matters such as methods for doing business, conducting research, diagnosing diseases or prescribing medications that are alleged to be broadly applicable across sectors of the industry, and we may receive assertions that these rights apply to us. The existence of such intellectual property rights could present a risk to our business.
 A license required under any patents or proprietary rights held by a third party may not be available to us, or may not be available on acceptable terms. If we or our licensors or suppliers are sued for infringement we could encounter substantial delays in, or be prohibited from developing, manufacturing and commercializing our product candidates and advancing our preclinical or clinical programs. In addition, any such litigation would be costly, time consuming, and might distract management from other important tasks.


We are dependent on our license agreements and if we fail to meet our obligations under these license agreements, or our agreements are terminated for any reason, we may lose our rights to our in-licensed patents and technologies.
 We are dependent on licenses for intellectual property for products and research and development, including in particular Inbrija and potential ARCUS-based programs. Our failure to meet any of our obligations under these license agreements could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property. If we lose our rights under any of these license agreements, we may be unable to commercialize, or continue commercializing, a product that uses licensed intellectual property.
 Risks relating to our common stock
 Our stock price may be volatile and you may lose all or a part of your investment.
 Our stock price could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, including:
 •achievement or rejection of regulatory approvals by us or our collaborators or by our competitors;
 •publicity regarding actual or potential clinical trial results or updates relating to products under development by us, our collaborators, or our competitors;
 •developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents, litigation and other legal proceedings relating to such proprietary rights;
 •dilution, or expected or potential dilution, relating to the issuance of additional shares of our common stock to satisfy conversion or make-whole payment obligations under, or interest on, our convertible senior secured notes due 2024;
 •issuance of additional shares of our common stock, and the expected dilution to our stockholders resulting therefrom, which may occur upon the refinancing of our convertible senior notes;
 •announcements of new acquisitions, collaborations, financings or other transactions, or of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or by us; 
 •regulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries;
 •changes in securities analysts' estimates of our performance or our failure to meet analysts' expectations;
 •sales of substantial amounts of our stock or short selling activity by investors;
 •variations in our anticipated or actual operating results;
 •conditions or trends in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries generally;
 •government regulation of drug pricing;
 •changes in healthcare reimbursement policies; and
 •events that affect, or have the potential to affect, general economic conditions, including but not limited to political unrest, global trade wars, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or disease outbreaks (such as the COVID-19 global pandemic).
 Many of these factors are beyond our control, and we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be indicative of our future performance. If our revenues in any particular period do not meet expectations, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures in that period, which could cause our operating results to suffer. If our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may fall by a significant amount.
 In addition, the stock markets in general, and the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have recently and can in the future experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.


We received a notice from Nasdaq that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price listing rule, which could result in our stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which in turn could cause a default under our indenture relating to our 2024 Notes.
On June 22, 2022, we received a deficiency letter (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum closing price required to maintain continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (the “Minimum Bid Requirement”). The Notice had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. To regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during this 180-day period, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend this period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(H). In February 2023, the Staff did grant an extension of the period within which we must regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement to June 20, 2023. In November 2022, our stockholders approved authorizing our Board to effect a reverse stock at any time within one year from the special meeting date. In the event we do not achieve compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement by June 20, 2023, we are committed to effecting a reverse stock split at a ratio of any whole number in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-20. However, there can be no assurance that a reverse stock split would result in a sustained higher stock price that would allow us to meet the Nasdaq stock price listing requirements, and the announcement and implementation of a reverse stock split could negatively affect the price of our common stock.
If our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market, holders of the 2024 Notes would have the right to require us to repurchase the 2024 Notes for 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, and result in an increase in the conversion rates of such notes. If holders representing a significant amount of the 2024 Notes were to exercise this repurchase right, we would be unable to pay, which would result in a default under the indenture governing the 2024 Notes. Such a default could, in turn, result in our bankruptcy or liquidation.
A delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market would materially and adversely affect a stockholder’s ability to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our common stock. Furthermore, our common stock could become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” regulations. Under such regulations, broker-dealers are required to, among other things, comply with disclosure and special suitability determinations prior to the sale of shares of common stock. If our common stock becomes subject to these regulations, the market price of our common stock and the liquidity thereof would be materially and adversely affected.
 Lastly, a delisting from the Nasdaq Global Select Market could greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, or use shares of common stock for business development or other corporate purposes.
We cannot predict the effect that a reverse stock split will have on the market price for shares of our common stock.
 Even though our stockholders approved a reverse stock split at the Special Meeting on November 11, 2022, we cannot predict the long-term impact of effecting a reverse stock split on the market price for shares of our common stock, and the history of similar reverse stock splits for companies in like circumstances has varied. Although a reverse stock split will initially result in an increased market price per share of our common stock, the market price per share may subsequently substantially decline and may continue to decline due to, among other factors, the performance of our business, economic conditions and other factors, some of which may not be under our control. Even with an increased market price per share, the total market capitalization of our shares might be lower than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split and it could continue to decline thereafter. There can be no assurance that implementing a reverse stock split will enable us to maintain our compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements.
 Future sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline, and future issuances of common stock could cause substantial dilution.
 If our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market by our executive officers, directors, 5% or greater stockholders or other stockholders, or the prospect of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our

common stock. As of March 10, 2023, 24,337,696 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding; options to acquire 964,556 shares of our common stock were outstanding, exercisable at an average exercise price of $69.16 per share, issued under our 2006 Employee Incentive Plan, our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, and our 2016 Inducement Plan. Additional shares of common stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to options and other stock-based awards under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan and under our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and additional stock-based awards could be issued under our 2016 Inducement Plan. To the extent that option holders exercise outstanding options, there may be further dilution and the sales of shares issued upon such exercises could cause our stock price to drop further. In addition, if we elect to settle all or a portion of our conversion or make-whole payment obligations under, and/or interest payments on, our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 in shares of our common stock, our stockholders could experience significant dilution. Lastly, in January 2021, we entered into an At The Market (ATM) Offering Agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC as sales agent. Pursuant to the ATM agreement, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of up to $15.25 million in an at-the-market offering, which could cause additional dilution if any of such shares are sold under the ATM.
 Certain provisions of Delaware law, our Certificate of Incorporation, and our Bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable or may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change our directors or our management, which could decrease the value of your shares.
 Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, and may have the effect of preventing or hindering any attempt by our stockholders to replace our current directors or officers. These provisions include:
 •Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.
 •Our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of preferred stock with rights, preferences and privileges determined by the board of directors. The ability to authorize and issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences on a discriminatory basis that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.
 •Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each with staggered three-year terms. As a result, only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders, and each of the two other classes of directors will continue to serve for the remainder of their respective three-year terms, limiting the ability of stockholders to reconstitute the board of directors.
 •The vote of the holders of 75% of the outstanding shares of our common stock is required in order to take certain actions, including amendment of our bylaws, removal of directors for cause and certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation.
 •Our Bylaws contain an exclusive forum clause providing that (i) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for actions or proceedings for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty; (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; (d) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder; or (e) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, and (ii) the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933.
 As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holders has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could have the effect of reducing your ability to receive a premium on your common stock.


Because we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, you will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.
 We have not paid cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date, and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The success of your investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased your shares.
 General Risk Factors
 Our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels or if there is a change in ownership of Acorda.
 The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“IRC”) contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayer's ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of fifty percent over a three-year period (“ownership change”). In the event of such an ownership change, IRC Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on pre-ownership change tax attributes such as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. On June 1, 2022, the Company experienced an ownership change. The Company completed a Section 382 analysis which included consideration of net unrealized built in gains or losses and determined that its tax attributes would be limited and thus require a valuation allowance.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $238.5 million of U.S. federal NOLs, of which $120.8 million at December 31, 2022 were incurred by our Biotie subsidiary. Our ability to use these NOL carryforwards will depend on the analysis of available positive and negative evidence, such as a history of earnings, reversing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and future projections. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance continues to be recorded against the Biotie net operating losses of $120.8 million and a partial valuation allowance of $57.9 million was recorded on Acorda’s return filing group net operating losses due to the change in ownership event.
 We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
 We are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as certain European countries where we have subsidiaries and/or subsidiary operations. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax liabilities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome with respect to the taxes we owe may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements. If the Internal Revenue Service, or other taxing authority, disagrees with the positions taken by us, we could have additional tax liability, and this could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, governments may adopt tax reform measures that significantly increase our worldwide tax liabilities, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We may expand our business through the acquisition of companies or businesses or in-licensing product candidates that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.
 We may in the future seek to expand our products and capabilities by acquiring one or more companies or businesses or in-licensing one or more product candidates. Our ability to enter into these types of transactions as part of our business strategy may be constrained based on our limited cash resources and/or limited access to other sources of capital needed to fund such transactions. Also, our ability to enter into such transactions is limited in part because of restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 which constrain the type and terms of such agreements. Acquisitions and in-licenses involve numerous risks, including:
 •substantial cash expenditures;
 •potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities;
 •incurrence or assumption of debt and contingent liabilities, some of which may not be disclosed to us and may be difficult or impossible for us to identify at the time of acquisition;


•exposure to business risks or issues, or legal or regulatory compliance issues, such as with the FDA, associated with the acquired or in-licensed company, business or product candidate, which may not be disclosed to us and may be difficult or impossible for us to identify at the time of acquisition or licensing;
 •difficulties in assimilating the personnel and/or operations of acquired companies;
 •diversion of our management’s attention away from other business concerns;
 •commencement of business in markets where we have limited or no direct experience; and
 •potential loss of our key employees or key employees of acquired companies or businesses.
 We cannot assure you that any acquisition or in-license will result in short-term or long-term benefits to us. We may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business or in-licensed products or product candidates, for example by underestimating the investment required to advance research and development programs, or overestimating likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar foreign regulators or the market potential of acquired or in-licensed products or product candidates. Acquired development programs are generally subject to all of the risks inherent in the drug development process, and our knowledge of the risks specifically relevant to acquired programs generally improves over time.
 In addition, our future success would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with some of these acquisitions and in-licenses. Any acquisition might distract resources from and otherwise harm sales of Inbrija or other products we currently, or may in the future, market. We cannot assure you that we would be able to make the combination of our business with that of acquired businesses or companies or in-licensed products or product candidates work or be successful. Furthermore, the development or expansion of our business or any acquired business or company or in-licensed product or product candidate may require a substantial capital investment by us. We may not have these necessary funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. We may also seek to raise funds by selling shares of our stock, which could dilute our current stockholders’ ownership interest, or securities convertible into our stock, which could dilute current stockholders’ ownership interest upon conversion. Also, although we may from time to time announce that we have entered into agreements to acquire other companies or assets, we cannot assure you that these acquisitions will be completed in a timely manner or at all. These transactions are subject to an inherent risk that they may not be completed, for example because required closing conditions cannot be met at all or within specified time periods, termination rights may be exercised such as due to a breach by one of the parties, or other contingencies may arise that affect the transaction.
 We face an inherent risk of liability in the event that the use or misuse of our products results in personal injury or death.
 If the use or misuse of Inbrija, Ampyra or any other approved products we or our collaborator or distributor may sell in the future harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, third-party payers or others. The use of our product candidates in clinical trials could also expose us to product liability claims. We currently maintain a product liability insurance policy that includes coverage for our marketed products as well as for clinical trials. The total insurance limit is $25 million per claim, and the aggregate amount of claims under the policy is also capped at $25 million. We cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result from the use of our products or the testing of product candidates and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we currently have may not be adequate to cover all liabilities or defense costs we might incur. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could give rise to a substantial liability that could exceed our resources. Even if claims are not successful, the costs of defending such claims and potential adverse publicity could be harmful to our business.
 Additionally, we have entered into various agreements where we indemnify third parties such as manufacturers and investigators for certain product liability claims related to our products. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnification obligations.
 We may be the subject of litigation, which, if adversely determined, could harm our business and operating results.
 From time to time, we may be subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. The costs of defending any litigation, whether in cash expenses or in management time, could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows, even if we ultimately win the litigation. An unfavorable outcome on any litigation matter could require that we pay substantial damages, or, in connection with any intellectual property infringement claims, could require that we pay ongoing royalty payments or prohibit us from selling certain of our products. In addition, we may decide to settle any litigation, which could cause us to incur significant settlement costs. A settlement or an unfavorable outcome on any

litigation matter could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. See Legal Proceedings contained in Part I, Item 3 of this report for more detailed information on existing or potential material legal proceedings.
 We depend on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems, or a system error, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 We are increasingly and substantially dependent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit sensitive data on our networks and systems, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information (such as research data) and confidential information (and personal information) with respect to our employees, customers, clinical trial patients and our business partners. In the ordinary course of our business, this type of data is also collected, stored, processed, and transmitted on the networks and systems of business partners and vendors from whom we purchase software and/or technology-based services.
 The size and complexity of our and third-party information technology systems and infrastructure, and their connection to the Internet, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions, system errors leading to data loss, data theft, unauthorized disclosure, and/or cyber-attacks. These incidents could result from inadvertent or intentional actions or omissions by our employees and consultants, or those of our business partners and vendors, or from the actions of third parties with criminal or other malicious intent. As with most other companies, our information technology systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject from time to time to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, and other forms or cyber-attack, and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such efforts to continue to increase. To date, we are not aware of any significant impact to our business or operations resulting from these occurrences affecting our or third-party information technology systems that we utilize; however, there is a growing risk of harm from these types of incidents, which could disrupt our operations, result in a loss of assets, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
 We are increasingly relying on the networks and systems of third-party vendors as we seek to migrate the storage and processing of business and other information from our own computer servers and networks to “cloud”-based storage and software systems and services maintained by third-party vendors. While we believe there are potential cost savings and other benefits from this migration strategy, we do not control how third-party vendors maintain their networks and systems, what technology they implement to protect their systems from cyber-attack or other malicious behavior, or what corrective or remedial measures they would take in response to service issues or a criminal or other malicious attack. Also, many of these vendors are large, well-known technology companies that maintain substantial volumes of information for a large number of companies, and whose systems may therefore be larger targets for criminal or other malicious actors as compared to our own networks and systems. Accordingly, our migration to third-party networks and system could increase the risk that business and other information maintained by us could be subject to a breach, theft, unauthorized disclosure, or other forms of cyber-attacks even if we are not specifically targeted.
 Unauthorized access to, or disclosure or theft of, our business information and/or other information we maintain could compromise our intellectual property, expose sensitive business information, and expose personal information of our clinical trial patients, employees, and others. Any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could harm our reputation and business, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could disrupt our business, result in increased costs or loss of revenue, and/or result in significant legal and financial exposure. Also, unauthorized access to, or disclosure of theft of, our business information and/or other information we maintain could cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt or force suspension of key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These events could also result in liability to others, if these incidents involve the data of others that we have agreed, or are otherwise legally responsible, to keep confidential and protect.
 Breaches of information technology systems and technology can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying any such incidents may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, and monitor such systems and infrastructure on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent the type of incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Also, we rely on the security measures and monitoring activities of our business partners and vendors who collect, store, process and transmit data on their networks and

systems. In the event they experience a service issue or security incident: we may not receive timely notice from them of the issue or incident; they may not take adequate steps to remediate the issue or incident and protect against future occurrences; we may not have any remedy against them for losses and liabilities that we suffer, or if we have a remedy it may be inadequate, even though they are or may be at fault; and we may become subject to legal claims from others whose information has been compromised regardless of whether we are at fault.
