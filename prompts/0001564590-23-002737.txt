Item 1. Business.
Overview
 Our business strategy is to acquire and develop behavioral healthcare facilities and improve our operating results within our facilities and our other behavioral healthcare operations. We strive to improve the operating results of our facilities by providing high-quality services, expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives while meeting the increased demand for behavioral healthcare services through expansion of our current locations as well as developing new services within existing locations. At December 31, 2022, we operated 250 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 11,000 beds in 39 states and Puerto Rico. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we added 560 beds, consisting of 290 added to existing facilities and 270 added through the opening of one wholly-owned facility and two joint venture facilities, and we opened seven comprehensive treatment centers (“CTCs”). 
 We are the leading publicly traded pure-play provider of behavioral healthcare services in the United States (the “U.S.”). Management believes that we are positioned as a leading platform in a highly fragmented industry under the direction of an experienced management team that has significant industry expertise. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources, increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count in the U.S. through acquisitions, wholly-owned de novo facilities, joint ventures and bed additions in existing facilities.
 On January 19, 2021, we completed the sale of our operations in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) to RemedcoUK Limited, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales and owned by funds managed or advised by Waterland Private Equity Fund VII (the “U.K. Sale”). The U.K. Sale allowed us to reduce our indebtedness and focus on our U.S. operations. We report, for all periods presented, results of operations and cash flows of the U.K. operations as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. See “U.K. Sale” below for additional details about the U.K. Sale. 
 Our common stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ACHC.” Our principal executive offices are located at 6100 Tower Circle, Suite 1000, Franklin, Tennessee 37067, and our telephone number is (615) 861-6000.
 Acquisitions 
 On November 7, 2022, we acquired four CTCs located in Georgia from Brand New Start Treatment Centers (“Brand New Start”).
 On December 31, 2021, we acquired the equity of CenterPointe Behavioral Health System, LLC and certain related entities (“CenterPointe”) for cash consideration of approximately $140 million. The acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand and a $70.0 million draw on the Revolving Facility (as defined below). At the time of the acquisition, CenterPointe operated four acute inpatient hospitals with 306 beds and ten outpatient locations primarily in Missouri.
 U.K. Sale
 On January 19, 2021, we completed the U.K. Sale pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement in which we sold all of the securities of AHC-WW Jersey Limited, a private limited liability company incorporated in Jersey and a subsidiary of the Company, which constituted the entirety of our U.K. operations. The U.K. Sale resulted in approximately $1,525 million of gross proceeds before deducting the settlement of existing foreign currency hedging liabilities of $85 million based on the current British Pounds (“GBP”) to U.S. Dollars (“USD”) exchange rate, cash retained by the buyer and transaction costs. We used the net proceeds of approximately $1,425 million (excluding cash retained by the buyer) along with cash from the balance sheet to reduce debt by $1,640 million during the first quarter of 2021. As a result of the U.K. Sale, we reported, for all periods presented, results of operations and cash flows of the U.K. operations as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.

Financing Transactions
 We entered into a credit agreement establishing a new senior credit facility (the “New Credit Facility”) on March 17, 2021. The New Credit Facility provides for a $600.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) and a $425.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility” and, together with the Revolving Facility, the “Senior Facilities”), each maturing on March 17, 2026 unless extended in accordance with the terms of the New Credit Facility. The Revolving Facility further provides for (i) up to $20.0 million to be utilized for the issuance of letters of credit and (ii) the availability of a swingline facility under which we may borrow up to $20.0 million. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information about the New Credit Facility and the Prior Credit Facility (as defined below). 
 As a part of the closing of the New Credit Facility on March 17, 2021, we (i) refinanced and terminated our prior credit facilities under an amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of December 31, 2012 (the “Prior Credit Facility”) and (ii) financed the redemption of all of our outstanding 5.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “5.625% Senior Notes”).
 In connection with the redemption of the 5.625% Senior Notes, we satisfied and discharged the indentures governing the 5.625% Senior Notes and recorded debt extinguishment costs of $3.3 million, including the write-off of deferred financing and premiums costs in the consolidated statement of operations.   
 On March 1, 2021, we satisfied and discharged the indentures governing the 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024 (“6.500% Senior Notes”). In connection with the redemption of the 6.500% Senior Notes, we recorded debt extinguishment costs of $10.5 million, including $6.3 million cash paid for breakage costs and the write-off of deferred financing costs of $4.2 million in the consolidated statement of operations.   
 On January 5, 2021, we made a voluntary payment of $105.0 million on our Term Loan B facility Tranche B-4 of the Prior Credit Facility (the “Tranche B-4 Facility”). On January 19, 2021, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the U.K. Sale to repay $311.7 million of the Term Loan A facility of the Prior Credit Facility (the “TLA Facility”) and $767.9 million of our Tranche B-4 Facility.
 On October 14, 2020, we issued $475.0 million of 5.000% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “5.000% Senior Notes”). The 5.000% Senior Notes mature April 15, 2029 and bear interest at a rate of 5.000% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15, commencing on April 15, 2021. We used the net proceeds of the 5.000% Senior Notes to prepay approximately $453.3 million of the outstanding borrowings on our Term Loan B facility Tranche B-3 of the Prior Credit Facility (the “Tranche B-3 Facility”) and used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to pay related fees and expenses in connection with the offering. In connection with the 5.000% Senior Notes, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $2.9 million, including the write-off of discount and deferred financing cost in the consolidated statements of operations.
 On June 24, 2020, we issued $450.0 million of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “5.500% Senior Notes”). The 5.500% Senior Notes mature on July 1, 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 5.500% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing on January 1, 2021. We used the net proceeds of the 5.500% Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, to redeem in full the outstanding 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “6.125% Senior Notes”) and the 5.125% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “5.125% Senior Notes”) and to pay related fees and expenses in connection therewith. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Management believes the following strengths differentiate us from other providers of behavioral healthcare services:
 Premier operational management team with track record of success. Our management team has approximately 300 combined years of experience in the healthcare industry. The extensive national experience and operational expertise of our management team give us what management believes to be the premier leadership team in the behavioral healthcare industry. Our management team strives to use its years of experience operating behavioral healthcare facilities to generate strong cash flow and grow a profitable business. 
 Favorable industry and legislative trends. According to a 2021 survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“SAMHSA”), 57.8 million adults in the U.S. aged 18 years or older suffered from a mental illness in the prior year and 14.1 million suffered from a serious mental illness. In addition, 29.7 million U.S. adults with mental illness received no mental health services in the past year. Further, approximately 43.7 million people aged 12 or older in 2021 needed substance use treatment in the past year. According to a study by The Journal of American Medical Association Pediatrics, an estimated 7.7 million U.S. children has a treatable mental health disorder. Management believes the market for behavioral services will continue to grow due to increased awareness of mental health and substance abuse conditions and treatment options. 
 2


While the growing awareness of mental health and substance abuse conditions is expected to accelerate demand for services, recent healthcare reform in the U.S. is expected to increase access to industry services as more people obtain insurance coverage. A key aspect of reform legislation is the extension of mental health parity protections established into law by the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (the “MHPAEA”). The MHPAEA requires employers who provide behavioral health and addiction benefits to provide such coverage to the same extent as other medical conditions. On December 13, 2016, then President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act. The 21st Century Cures Act appropriates substantial resources for the treatment of behavioral health and substance abuse disorders and contains measures intended to strengthen the MHPAEA. On October 21, 2018, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (the “SUPPORT Act”) was signed into law. The SUPPORT Act expands Medicare coverage to include Opioid Treatment Programs for services provided on or after January 2, 2020. It also includes Individuals in Medicaid Deserve Care that is Appropriate and Responsible in its Execution Act, which suspends the current prohibition on using federal Medicaid funds to pay for substance use disorder treatment at inpatient treatment facilities with more than 16 beds and limits beneficiaries to no more than 30 days of inpatient treatment per 12 month period. 
 National footprint and scale with regional density and presence across multiple service lines. We are a leading behavioral healthcare platform in an industry that is undergoing consolidation in an effort to reduce costs and expand programs to better serve the growing need for inpatient behavioral healthcare services. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources, increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count.
 Diversified revenue and payor bases. At December 31, 2022, we operated 250 facilities in 39 states and Puerto Rico. Our payor, patient and geographic diversity mitigates the potential risk associated with any single facility. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received 51% of our revenue from continuing operations from Medicaid, 30% from commercial payors, 15% from Medicare and 4% from other payors. As we receive Medicaid payments from 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, management does not believe that we are significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies in any one state or territory. No facility accounted for more than 4% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, and no state or U.S. territory accounted for more than 14% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that our increased geographic diversity will mitigate the impact of any financial or budgetary pressure that may arise in a particular state or market where we operate.
 Strong financial position to execute our strategy. Management believes we continue to be in a strong position for investments in our facilities, expansion into new and existing markets and enhancement of our capabilities and infrastructure. We generate strong free cash flow by profitably operating our business and by actively managing our working capital. Moreover, as the behavioral healthcare business does not typically require the procurement and replacement of expensive medical equipment, our maintenance capital expenditure requirements are generally less than that of other facility-based healthcare providers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our maintenance capital expenditures amounted to approximately 2% of our revenue. 
 Business Strategy
 Our strategy is to become the indispensable behavioral health provider for the high-acuity and complex needs patient population. We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high-quality, cost-effective behavioral healthcare services, while growing our business, increasing profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. This strategy includes five growth pathways: expansions of existing facilities, joint venture partnerships, de novo facilities, acquisitions and expansion across our continuum of care. Our core strategic priorities include:
 Drive organic growth of existing facilities. We seek to increase revenue at our facilities by providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients. In addition, management intends to increase bed counts in our existing facilities. We added 290 beds to existing facilities during the year ended December 31, 2022, and expect to add approximately 300 beds to existing facilities for the year ending December 31, 2023. Furthermore, management believes that opportunities exist to leverage out-of-state referrals to increase volume and minimize payor concentration, especially with respect to our youth and adolescent focused services and our substance abuse services.
 Management believes we can improve efficiencies and increase operating margins by utilizing our management’s expertise and experience within existing programs and their expertise in improving performance at underperforming facilities. Management believes the efficiencies can be realized by investing in growth in strong markets, addressing capital-constrained facilities that have underperformed and improving management systems.

Fuel facility growth through accelerated joint venture partnerships and de novo builds and pursuing programmatic mergers and acquisitions. We have positioned the Company as a leading provider of mental health services in the U.S. The behavioral healthcare industry in the U.S. is highly fragmented, and we selectively seek opportunities to expand and diversify our base of operations by acquiring additional facilities and entering into partnerships with healthcare providers to acquire and develop additional facilities. We have a number of potential joint ventures and acquisitions in various stages of development and consideration in the U.S.
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we added 270 beds through the opening of one wholly-owned facility and two joint venture facilities, and we opened seven CTCs. For the year ending December 31, 2023, we expect to open two wholly-owned facilities, two joint venture facilities and at least six CTCs.
 Management believes our focus on behavioral healthcare and history of completing acquisitions provides us with a strategic advantage in sourcing, evaluating and closing acquisitions. We leverage our management team’s expertise to identify and integrate acquisitions based on a disciplined acquisition strategy that focuses on quality of service, return on investment and strategic benefits. We also have a comprehensive post-acquisition strategic plan to facilitate the integration of acquired facilities that includes improving facility operations, retaining and recruiting psychiatrists and other healthcare professionals and expanding the breadth of services offered by the facilities.
 Accelerate expansion across the care continuum, particularly for patients with opioid use and other substance use disorders. Our growth strategy includes a patient-centric approach covering the full continuum of care, with deep expertise in treating high needs patients. We focus on the most complex patients and are also working to reach underserved patient populations by expanding our breadth of services and increasing access points within new and existing metropolitan statistical areas. 
 COVID-19 Impact
 During March 2020, the global pandemic of the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 (“COVID-19”) began to affect our facilities, employees, patients, communities, business operations and financial performance, as well as the broader U.S. and U.K. economies and financial markets. At many of our facilities, employees and/or patients have tested positive for COVID-19. We are committed to protecting the health of our communities and have been responding to the evolving COVID-19 situation while taking steps to provide quality care and protect the health and safety of our patients and employees. Over the last three years, all of our facilities have closely followed infectious disease protocols, as well as recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and local health officials. 
 U.S. Operations
 Our facilities and services can generally be classified into the following categories: acute inpatient psychiatric facilities; specialty treatment facilities; CTCs; and residential treatment centers. Outpatient programs associated with our facilities are included within each respective service line. The table below presents the percentage of our total U.S. revenue attributed to each category for the year ended December 31, 2022:
 
 
Facility/Service | Revenue for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 | 
---------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+---
Acute inpatient psychiatric facilities | | 51 | %
Specialty treatment facilities | | 22 | %
Comprehensive treatment centers | | 16 | %
Residential treatment centers | | 11 | %

 
We receive payments from the following sources for services rendered in our facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by CMS; and (iv) individual patients and clients. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received 51% of our revenue from Medicaid, 30% from commercial payors, 15% from Medicare and 4% from other payors.
 At December 31, 2022, our facilities included 250 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 11,000 beds in 39 states and Puerto Rico. Of our facilities, excluding CTCs, approximately 53% are acute inpatient psychiatric facilities, approximately 37% are specialty treatment facilities and approximately 10% are residential treatment centers at December 31, 2022. Of the 250 behavioral healthcare facilities, 151 are CTCs. Of the CTCs, 16 are owned properties and 135 are leased properties. Of the facilities that are not CTCs, 91% of our beds are at owned properties and 9% are at leased properties. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our continuing operations generated revenue of $2,610.4 million and $2,314.4 million, respectively.

Acute Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities
 Acute inpatient psychiatric facilities provide a high level of care in order to stabilize patients that are either a threat to themselves or to others. The acute setting provides 24-hour observation, daily intervention and monitoring by psychiatrists. Generally, due to shorter lengths of stay, the related higher patient turnover, and the special security and health precautions required, acute inpatient psychiatric facilities have lower average occupancy than residential treatment centers. Our facilities that offer acute care services provide evaluation and crisis stabilization of patients with severe psychiatric diagnoses through a medical delivery model that incorporates structured and intensive medical and behavioral therapies with 24-hour monitoring by a psychiatrist, psychiatric trained nurses, therapists and other direct care staff. Lengths of stay for crisis stabilization and acute care range from three to five days and from five to twelve days, respectively.
Specialty Treatment Facilities
 Our specialty treatment facilities include residential recovery facilities and eating disorder facilities. We provide a comprehensive continuum of care for adults with addictive disorders and co-occurring mental disorders. Our detoxification, inpatient, partial hospitalization and outpatient treatment programs are cost-effective and give patients access to the least restrictive level of care. All programs offer individualized treatment in a supportive and nurturing environment.
 The majority of our specialty treatment services are provided to patients who abuse addictive substances such as alcohol, illicit drugs or opiates, including prescription drugs. Some of our facilities also treat other addictions and behavioral disorders such as chronic pain, sexual compulsivity, compulsive gambling, mood disorders, emotional trauma and abuse. The goal of our treatment facilities is to provide the appropriate level of treatment to an individual no matter where they are in the lifecycle of their disease in order to restore the individual to a healthier, more productive life, free from dependence on illicit substances and destructive behaviors. Our treatment facilities provide a number of different treatment services such as assessment, detoxification, medication-assisted treatment, counseling, education, lectures and group therapy. We assess and evaluate the medical, psychological and emotional needs of the patient and address these needs in the treatment process. Following this assessment, an individualized treatment program is designed to provide a foundation for a lifelong recovery process. Many modalities are used in our treatment programs to support the individual, including the twelve step philosophy, cognitive/behavioral therapies, supportive therapies and continuing care.
 Residential Recovery Facilities. Our inpatient facilities house and care for patients over an extended period and typically treat patients from a broadly defined regional market. We provide three basic levels of residential treatment depending on the severity of the patient’s addiction and/or behavioral disorder. Patients with the most severe dependencies are typically placed into inpatient treatment, in which the patient resides at a treatment facility. If a patient’s condition is less severe, he or she will be offered day treatment, which allows the patient to return home in the evening. The least intensive service is where the patient visits the facility for just a few hours a week to attend counseling/group sessions.
 Following primary treatment, our extended care programs typically offer residential care, which allows patients to develop healthy and appropriate living skills while remaining in a safe and nurturing setting. Patients are supported in their recovery by a semi-structured living environment that allows them to begin the process of employment or to pursue educational goals and to take personal responsibility for their recovery. The structure of this treatment phase is monitored by a primary therapist who works with each patient to integrate recovery skills and build a foundation of sobriety with a strong support system. Length of stay will vary depending on the patient’s needs with a minimum stay of 30 days and could be multiple months if needed.
 Our outpatient clinics serve patients that do not require inpatient treatment or are transitioning from a residential treatment program; have employment, family or school commitments; and have stabilized in their substance addiction recovery practices and are seeking ongoing continuing care.
 Eating Disorder Facilities. Our eating disorder facilities provide treatment services for eating disorders and weight management, each of which may be effectively treated through a combination of medical, psychological and social treatment programs.
 Our behavioral therapies are delivered in an array of treatment models that may include individual and group therapy, intensive outpatient, outpatient, partial hospitalization/day treatment, road to recovery and other programs that can be either abstinent or medication-assisted based.
 Comprehensive Treatment Centers
 Our CTCs specialize in providing medication-assisted treatment in an outpatient setting. Medication-assisted treatment combines behavioral therapy and medication to treat substance use disorders. CTCs utilize medication-assisted treatment to 
 5


individuals addicted to opiates such as opioid analgesics (prescription pain medications). Medication is used to normalize brain chemistry to block the euphoric effects of alcohol and opioids allowing our professional staff to provide behavioral therapy. Patients begin their treatment attending the clinic almost daily. Then, through successfully progressing in treatment, patients attend less frequently depending on individual treatment plans. The length of treatment differs from patient to patient, but typically lasts longer than one year.
 Each of our CTCs provide a range of comprehensive substance abuse treatment support services that include medical, counseling, vocational, educational, and other treatment services. 
 Residential Treatment Centers
 Residential treatment centers treat patients with behavioral disorders in a non-hospital setting, including outdoor programs. The facilities balance therapy activities with social, academic and other activities. Because the setting is less intensive, demands on staffing, security and oversight are generally lower than inpatient psychiatric facilities. In contrast to acute care psychiatric facilities, occupancy in residential treatment centers can be managed more easily given a longer length of stay. Over time, however, residential treatment centers have continued to serve increasingly severe patients who would have been treated in acute care facilities in earlier years.
 We provide residential treatment care through a medical model residential treatment facility, which offers intensive, medically-driven interventions and individualized treatment regimens designed to deal with moderate to high level patient acuity. Children and adolescents admitted to these facilities typically have had multiple prior failed treatment plans, severe physical, sexual and emotional abuse, termination of parental custody, substance abuse, marked deficiencies in social, interpersonal and academic skills and a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Treatment typically is provided by an interdisciplinary team coordinating psychopharmacological, individual, group and family therapy, along with specialized accredited educational programs in both secure and unlocked environments. Lengths of stay range from three months to several years.
 Certain of our residential treatment centers provide group home, therapeutic group home and therapeutic foster care programs. Our group home programs provide family-style living for youths in a single house or apartment within residential communities where supervision and support are provided by 24-hour staff. The goal of a group home program is to teach family living and social skills through individual and group counseling sessions within a real life environment. The residents are encouraged to take responsibility for the home and their health as well as actively take part in community functions. Most attend an accredited and licensed on-premises school or a local public school. We also operate therapeutic group homes that provide comprehensive treatment services for seriously, emotionally disturbed adolescents. The ultimate goal is to reunite or place these children with their families or prepare them, when appropriate, for permanent placement with a relative or an adoptive family. We also manage therapeutic foster care programs, which are considered the least restrictive form of therapeutic placement for children and adolescents with emotional disorders. Children and adolescents in our therapeutic foster care programs often are part of the child welfare or juvenile justice system. Care is delivered in private homes with experienced foster parents who are trained to work with children and adolescents with special needs.
 U.K. Operations
 Prior to the U.K. Sale, we were the leading independent provider of mental health services in the U.K. operating 345 inpatient behavioral health facilities with approximately 8,200 beds at December 31, 2020. Our U.K. facilities were located in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our U.K. operations generated revenue of $62.5 million and $1,119.8 million, respectively, primarily through the operation and management of inpatient behavioral health facilities. 
 Additional information about our U.K. operations and the U.K.’s behavioral healthcare industry can be found in our prior filings with the SEC.
 Sources of Revenue
  As of December 31, 2022, we received payments from the following sources for services rendered in our facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by CMS; and (iv) individual patients and clients. We determine the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients and implicit price concessions. Contractual adjustments and discounts are based on contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. Implicit price concessions are based on historical collection experience. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies — Revenue and Accounts Receivable”

for additional disclosure. Other information related to our revenue, income and other operating information is provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Regulation
 The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare program participation requirements, various licensure and accreditation standards, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and government healthcare program fraud and abuse provisions. Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to loss or limitation of licenses to operate, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. 
Licensing, Certification and Accreditation
 All of our facilities must comply with various federal, state and local licensing and certification regulations and undergo periodic inspection by licensing agencies to certify compliance with such regulations. The initial and continued licensure of our facilities and certification to participate in government healthcare programs depends upon many factors including various state licensure regulations relating to quality of care, environment of care, equipment, services, staff training, personnel and the existence of adequate policies, procedures and controls. Federal, state and local agencies survey our facilities on a regular basis to determine whether the facilities are in compliance with regulatory operating and health standards and conditions for participating in government healthcare programs.
 Most of our inpatient and residential facilities maintain accreditation from private entities, such as The Joint Commission or the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (“CARF”). The Joint Commission and CARF are private organizations that have accreditation programs for a broad spectrum of healthcare facilities. The Joint Commission accredits a broad variety of healthcare organizations, including hospitals and behavioral health organizations. CARF accredits behavioral health organizations providing mental health and alcohol and drug use and addiction services, as well as opiate treatment programs, and many other types of healthcare programs. These accreditation programs are intended generally to improve the quality, safety, outcomes and value of healthcare services provided by accredited facilities. Certain federal and state licensing agencies as well as many government and private healthcare payment programs require that providers be accredited as a condition of licensure, certification or participation. Accreditation is typically granted for a specified period, ranging from one to three years, and renewals of accreditation generally require completion of a renewal application and an on-site renewal survey.
 Certificates of Need
 Many of the states in which we operate facilities have enacted certificate of need (“CON”) laws that regulate the construction or expansion of certain healthcare facilities, certain capital expenditures or changes in services or bed capacity. Failure to obtain CON approval of certain activities can result in: our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement; the imposition of civil penalties; the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement; or the revocation of a facility’s license, any of which could harm our business.
Audits
 Our healthcare facilities are also subject to federal, state and commercial payor audits to validate the accuracy of claims submitted to government healthcare programs and commercial payors. If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to make substantial repayments, subject to various appeal rights. Our facilities are routinely subjected to claims audits in the ordinary course of business. While no such audit has identified any material overpayment liability, should a potential material overpayment liability arise from a future audit, such overpayment liability may ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial. Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations, as well as commercial payor contracts, also provide for withholding or suspending payments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.
The Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law and the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act
 The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, in cash or in kind, as an inducement or reward for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for referrals or orders of services or other items paid for by a government healthcare program. The Anti-Kickback Statute may be found to have been violated if at least one purpose of the remuneration is to induce or reward referrals. A provider is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute to be found guilty of violating the law.

The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the “OIG”) has issued safe harbor regulations that protect certain types of common arrangements from prosecution or sanction under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements falling outside the safe harbors may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. In December of 2020, the OIG finalized revisions to the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors and created new safe harbors for value-based care that became effective January 19, 2021. The new regulations are intended to improve patient care and foster innovative care models by easing regulatory burdens to coordinated and value-based care.
 Although management believes that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources comply with current law and available interpretative guidance, as a practical matter it is not always possible to structure our arrangements so as to fall squarely within an available safe harbor. Where that is the case, we cannot guarantee that applicable regulatory authorities will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws, including state anti-kickback laws.
 In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, also known as the Stark Law, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to healthcare entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship for the furnishing of any “designated health services” unless certain exceptions apply. A violation of the Stark Law may result in a denial of payment; required refunds to the Medicare program; imposition of statutory civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 for each prohibited claim and up to $100,000 for circumvention schemes; exclusion from government healthcare programs; and liability under the False Claims Act. There are ownership and compensation arrangement exceptions for many customary financial arrangements between physicians and facilities, including the employment exception, personal services exception, lease exception and certain recruitment exceptions. As part of CMS’s “regulatory sprint to coordinated care”, CMS finalized revisions to the exceptions and created new exceptions for value-based care that became effective on January 19, 2021. As with the changes made to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the new Stark exceptions are intended to improve patient care and foster innovative care models by easing regulatory burdens to coordinated and value-based care. 
 Management believes that our financial arrangements with physicians are structured to comply with the regulatory exceptions to the Stark Law. However, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute, meaning that no intent is required to violate the law, and even a technical violation may lead to significant penalties.
 These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our arrangements relating to facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict whether other federal or state legislation or regulations will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
 The SUPPORT Act contains a number of provisions aimed at identifying at-risk individuals, increasing access to opioid abuse treatment, reducing overprescribing and promoting data sharing with the primary goal of reducing the use and abuse of opioids. Additionally, the SUPPORT Act attempts to address the problem of “patient brokering” in the context of addiction treatment facilities and sober living homes. 
 One section of the SUPPORT Act, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (the “EKRA”), makes it a federal crime to knowingly and willfully: (1) solicit or receive any remuneration in return for referring a patient to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility or laboratory; or (2) pay or offer any remuneration to induce such a referral or in exchange for an individual using the services of a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Each conviction under the EKRA is punishable by up to $200,000 in monetary damages, imprisonment for up to ten (10) years, or both. Unlike the Anti-Kickback Statutes, the EKRA is not limited to services reimbursable under a government healthcare program. The EKRA also contains exceptions similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors, but those exceptions are more narrow than the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors such that practices that would be permissible under the Anti-Kickback Statute may violate the EKRA.
 If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, the EKRA or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the government healthcare programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Federal False Claims Act and Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions
 The federal False Claims Act provides the government a tool to pursue healthcare providers for submitting false claims or requests for payment for healthcare items or services. Under the False Claims Act, the government may fine any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly submits, or causes the submission of, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The federal government has widely used the False Claims Act to prosecute Medicare and other federal healthcare program fraud such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, submitting false cost reports and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality. Claims for services or items rendered in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law can provide a basis for liability under the False Claims Act as well. The False Claims Act is also implicated by the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later.
 Violations of the False Claims Act are punishable by significant penalties totaling $13,508 to $27,018 for each fraudulent claim plus three times the amount of damages sustained by the government. In addition, under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claims Act, private parties may bring actions under the False Claims Act on behalf of the federal government. These private parties, known as relators, are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, whistleblower lawsuits have increased significantly in recent years. Many states have similar false claims statutes that impose liability for the types of acts prohibited by the False Claims Act or that otherwise prohibit the submission of false or fraudulent claims to the state government or Medicaid program.
 In addition to the False Claims Act, the federal government may use several criminal laws, such as the federal mail fraud, wire fraud or healthcare fraud statutes, to prosecute the submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. Most states have also adopted generally applicable insurance fraud statutes and regulations that prohibit healthcare providers from submitting inaccurate, incorrect or misleading claims to private insurance companies. Management believes our healthcare facilities have implemented appropriate safeguards and procedures to complete claim forms and requests for payment in an accurate manner and to operate in compliance with applicable laws. However, the possibility of billing or other errors can never be completely eliminated, and we cannot guarantee that the government or a qui tam plaintiff, upon audit or review, would not take the position that billing, the quality of patient care or other deficiencies or errors, should they occur, are violations of the False Claims Act.
 HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements
 The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of individually identifiable protected health information (“PHI”). The privacy and security regulations control the use and disclosure of PHI and the rights of patients to be informed about and control how such PHI is used and disclosed. Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.
 The HIPAA security regulations require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI. HITECH has strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of PHI, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates and created security breach notification requirements including notifications to the individuals affected by the breach, the Department of Health and Human Services, and in certain cases, the media. HITECH has also increased maximum penalties for violations of HIPAA privacy rules. Management believes that we have been in material compliance with the HIPAA regulations and have developed our policies and procedures to ensure ongoing compliance, although we cannot guarantee that our facilities will not be subject to security incidents or breaches which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 The Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act
 The Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act (“EMTALA”) is intended to ensure public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay. Section 1867 of the Social Security Act imposes specific obligations on Medicare-participating hospitals that offer emergency services to provide a medical screening examination when a request is made for examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition regardless of an individual’s ability to pay. Hospitals are then required to provide stabilizing treatment for patients with emergency medical conditions. If a hospital is unable to stabilize a patient within its capability, or if the patient requests, an appropriate transfer must be implemented. EMTALA imposes additional obligations on hospitals with specialized capabilities, such as ours, to accept the transfer of patients in need of such specialized capabilities if those patients present in the emergency room of a hospital that does not possess the specialized capabilities.

Mental Health Parity Legislation
 The MHPAEA was signed into law in October 2008 and requires health insurance plans that offer mental health and addiction coverage to provide that coverage on par with financial and treatment coverage offered for other illnesses. The MHPAEA has some limitations because health plans that do not already cover mental health treatments are not required to do so, and health plans are not required to provide coverage for every mental health condition published in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders by the American Psychiatric Association. The MHPAEA also contains a cost exemption which operates to exempt a group health plan from the MHPAEA’s requirements if compliance with the MHPAEA becomes too costly.
 On December 13, 2016, then President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act. The 21st Century Cures Act appropriated substantial resources for the treatment of behavioral health and substance abuse disorders and contained measures intended to strengthen the MHPAEA. 
 CARES Act and Other Regulatory Developments 
 On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act is intended to provide over $2 trillion in stimulus benefits for the U.S. economy. Among other things, the CARES Act includes additional support for small businesses, expands unemployment benefits, makes forgivable loans available to small businesses, provides for certain federal income tax changes, and provides $500 billion for loans, loan guarantees, and other investments for or in U.S. businesses.
 In addition, the CARES Act contains a number of provisions that are intended to assist healthcare providers as they combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those provisions include, among others:
  
• | an appropriation to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (“PHSSE Fund”), also known as the Provider Relief Fund, to reimburse, through grants or other mechanisms, eligible healthcare providers and other approved entities for COVID-19-related expenses or lost revenue;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the expansion of CMS’ Accelerated and Advance Payment Program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | the temporary suspension of Medicare sequestration from May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022, which was reduced to 1% on April 1, 2022 and was eliminated effective July 1, 2022; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | waivers or temporary suspension of certain regulatory requirements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 The U.S. government initially announced it would offer $100 billion of relief to eligible healthcare providers through the PHSSE Fund. On April 24, 2020, then President Trump signed into law the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (the “PPP Act”). Among other things, the PPP Act allocates $75 billion to eligible healthcare providers to help offset COVID-19 related losses and expenses. The $75 billion allocated under the PPP Act is in addition to the $100 billion allocated to healthcare providers for the same purposes in the CARES Act and has been disbursed to providers under terms and conditions similar to the CARES Act funds. In 2020, we received approximately $34.9 million of the funds distributed from the PHSSE Fund. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded approximately $32.8 million of income from provider relief fund related to PHSSE Fund funds received in 2020.

    In 2021, we received $24.2 million of additional funds from the PHSSE Fund. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded $17.9 million of income from provider relief fund related to PHSSE Fund funds received. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received $7.7 million of additional funds from the PHSSE Fund and $14.2 million from the American Rescue Plan (“ARP”) Rural Payments for Hospitals. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $21.5 million of income from provider relief fund related to PHSSE Fund and ARP funds received. The remaining ARP funds of $9.0 million are included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. We continue to evaluate our compliance with the terms and conditions to, and the financial impact of, these additional funds received, including potential repayment of the remaining balance.
 Healthcare providers were required to sign an attestation confirming receipt of the Provider Relief Fund funds and agree to the terms and conditions of payment. Under the terms and conditions for receipt of the payment, we were allowed to use the funds to cover lost revenues and healthcare costs related to COVID-19, and we were required to properly and fully document the use of these funds to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). The reporting of the funds is subject to future audit for compliance with the terms and conditions. We recognized Provider Relief Fund funds to the extent we had qualifying COVID-19 expenses or lost revenues as permitted under the terms and conditions. The grant income associated with the COVID-19 expenses and 
 10


lost revenues incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is reflected as income from provider relief fund in our consolidated statement of operations.
 During 2020, we applied for and received approximately $45.2 million of payments from the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payment Program. Of the $45.2 million of advance payments received in 2020, we repaid approximately $25.1 million of advance payments during 2021 and made additional repayments of approximately $20.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 to eliminate the liability. 
 Under the CARES Act, we received a 2% increase in our facilities’ Medicare reimbursement rate as a result of the temporary suspension of Medicare sequestration from May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022, which was reduced to 1% on April 1, 2022 and was eliminated effective July 1, 2022.
 The CARES Act also provides for certain federal income and other tax changes. We received a cash benefit of approximately $39.3 million for 2020 relating to the delay of payment of the employer portion of Social Security payroll taxes. We repaid half of the $39.3 million of payroll tax deferrals during the third quarter of 2021 and repaid the remaining portion in the third quarter of 2022 to eliminate the liability. 
 In addition to the financial and other relief that has been provided by the federal government through the CARES Act and other legislation passed by Congress, CMS and many state governments have also issued waivers and temporary suspensions of healthcare facility licensure, certification, and reimbursement requirements in order to provide hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare providers with increased flexibility to meet the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, CMS and many state governments have temporarily eased regulatory requirements and burdens for delivering and being reimbursed for healthcare services provided remotely through telemedicine. CMS has also temporarily waived many provisions of the Stark law, including many of the provisions affecting our relationships with physicians. Many states have also suspended the enforcement of certain regulatory requirements to ensure that healthcare providers have sufficient capacity to treat COVID-19 patients. These regulatory changes are temporary, with most slated to expire at the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency, expected in May 2023.  
 We are continuing to evaluate the terms and conditions and financial impact of funds received under the CARES Act and other government relief programs.
 Corporate Integrity Agreement
 During the second quarter of 2019, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement (the “CIA”) with the OIG imposing certain compliance obligations on us and our subsidiary, CRC Health. For further discussion of the background of this matter and the CIA, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors— We could be subject to monetary penalties and other sanctions, including exclusion from federal healthcare programs, if we fail to comply with the terms of the CIA”. 
Risk Management and Insurance 
 The healthcare industry in general continues to experience an increase in the frequency and severity of litigation and claims. As is typical in the healthcare industry, we are subject to claims that our services have resulted in injury to our patients or clients or other adverse effects. In addition, resident, visitor and employee injuries also subject us to the risk of litigation. While management believes that quality care is provided to patients and clients in our facilities and that we substantially comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, an adverse settlement determination in a legal proceeding or government investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Our statutory workers’ compensation program is fully insured with a $0.5 million deductible per accident. A portion of our professional liability risks are insured through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary providing coverage for up to $10.0 million per claim through August 31, 2022 and $5.0 million and $10.0 million for certain other claims thereafter. We have obtained reinsurance coverage from a third party to cover claims in excess of those limits. The reinsurance policy has a coverage limit of $75.0 million or $70.0 million for certain other claims in the aggregate. Our reinsurance receivables are recognized consistent with the related liabilities and include known claims and any incurred but not reported claims that are covered by current insurance policies in place.
 Environmental Matters
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws that: (i) regulate certain activities and operations that may have environmental or health and safety effects, such as the handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of medical waste 
 11


products generated at our facilities, the identification and warning of the presence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, as well as the removal of such materials, the presence of other hazardous substances in the indoor environment and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with the development or construction of our facilities; (ii) impose liability for costs of cleaning up, and damages to natural resources from, past spills, waste disposals on and off-site, or other releases of hazardous materials or regulated substances; and (iii) regulate workplace safety. Some of our facilities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of our patients. The management of infectious medical waste is subject to regulation under various federal, state and local environmental laws, which establish management requirements for such waste. These requirements include record-keeping, notice and reporting obligations. Each of our facilities has an agreement with a waste management company for the disposal of medical waste. The use of such companies, however, does not completely protect us from violations of medical waste laws or from related third-party claims for clean-up costs.
 From time to time, our operations have resulted in, or may result in, non-compliance with, or liability pursuant to, environmental or health and safety laws or regulations. Management believes that our operations are generally in compliance with environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements, including legal requirements relating to climate change, or that any non-compliance will not result in a material liability or cost to achieve compliance. Historically, the costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations at our facilities have not been material. However, we cannot assure you that future costs and expenses required for us to comply with any new or changes in existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or new or discovered environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we could be affected by climate change to the extent that climate change results in severe weather conditions or other disruptions impacting the communities in which our facilities are located. For more information regarding climate change and its possible adverse impact on us, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Operational Risks — Our business and operations are subject to risks related to natural disasters and climate change”.
 We have not been notified of and management is otherwise currently not aware of any contamination at our currently or formerly operated facilities that could result in material liability or cost to us under environmental laws or regulations for the investigation and remediation of such contamination, and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any such contamination conditions. There may, however, be environmental conditions currently unknown to us relating to our prior, existing or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 New laws, regulations or policies or changes in existing laws, regulations or policies or their enforcement, future spills or accidents or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliances may give rise to investigation and remediation liabilities, compliance costs, fines and penalties, or liability and claims for alleged personal injury or property damage due to substances or materials used in our operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Competition
 The healthcare industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors include other behavioral healthcare service companies, including Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE: UHS) and other hospitals and general healthcare facilities that provide mental health services. An important part of our business strategy is to continue making targeted acquisitions of other behavioral health facilities. However, reduced capacity, the passage of mental health parity legislation and increased demand for mental health services are likely to attract other potential buyers, including diversified healthcare companies, other pure-play behavioral healthcare companies and private equity firms.
 In addition to the competition we face for acquisitions, we must also compete for patients. Patients are referred to our behavioral healthcare facilities through a number of different sources, including healthcare practitioners, public programs, other treatment facilities, managed care organizations, unions, emergency departments, judicial officials, social workers, police departments and word of mouth from previously treated patients and their families, among others. These referral sources may instead refer patients to hospitals that are able to provide a full suite of medical services or to other behavioral healthcare centers.
 Human Capital
 At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 23,000 employees, of which 17,000 were employed full-time. At December 31, 2022, labor unions represented approximately 350 of our employees at two of our facilities through four collective bargaining agreements. Organizing activities by labor unions and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future. 
 Typically, our inpatient facilities are staffed by a chief executive officer, medical director, director of nursing, chief financial officer, clinical director and director of performance improvement. Psychiatrists and other physicians working in our facilities are 
 12


licensed medical professionals who are generally not employed by us and work in our facilities as independent contractors or medical staff members.
 Diversity and Inclusion
 We are committed to maintaining a welcoming and inclusive environment that treats everyone with dignity and respect. Approximately 74% of our employees are women and approximately 48% are people of color. We have policies that strictly prohibit any discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, religion, disability, gender, marital status, veteran status or any other basis prohibited by federal, state or local law.
 We have also established a Diversity and Inclusion Council, a multidisciplinary group, to oversee and advance diversity and inclusion initiatives.
 Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention 
 Our success is dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented, dedicated employees. We are committed to being an employer of choice and offer a compelling total rewards program. In addition to base salaries, we offer our employees a full spectrum of benefits, including medical, dental, vision and disability plans, health savings and flexible spending accounts, a 401(k) retirement savings plan that includes a matching contribution, paid time off and employee assistance programs. We also conduct comprehensive employee satisfaction surveys to assess and ensure that we are responsive to the desires and concerns of our employees.
 Like most healthcare providers, our facilities have experienced rising labor costs and turnover, and we have resorted to using more expensive contract labor at certain of our facilities. In some markets, the availability and retention of qualified medical personnel have become significant operating issues to healthcare providers, including at certain of our facilities. Shortages of nurses, qualified addiction counselors and other medical and care support personnel could result in a number of adverse impacts to our business, including capacity and growth constraints, reduced patient satisfaction, reduced employee satisfaction, impact on services offered, and increased costs, among others. For more information regarding risks of rising labor costs and its possible adverse impact on us, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Human Capital Risks — Our facilities face competition for staffing, labor shortages and higher turnover rates that may increase our labor costs and reduce our profitability”.
 Health and Safety
 We are committed to providing care to our patients in a safe, therapeutic environment. In furtherance of this commitment, we provide our employees with access to a variety of workplace safety training programs and continually evaluate our policies promoting patient safety and employee wellbeing. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented numerous changes to our policies and procedures to ensure the health of our patients, employees, contractors and communities, including instituting social distancing practices and protective measures throughout our facilities, which included restricting or suspending visitor access, screening patients and staff who enter our facilities based on criteria established by the CDC and local health officials, and testing and isolating patients when warranted.
 Seasonality of Demand for Services
 Our residential recovery and other inpatient facilities typically experience lower patient volumes and revenue during the holidays, and our child and adolescent facilities typically experience lower patient volumes and revenue during the summer months, holidays and other periods when school is out of session.
