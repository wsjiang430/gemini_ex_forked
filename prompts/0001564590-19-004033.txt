--------+----------

Overview
 We are a diversified government solutions company with the scale and experience needed to solve tough government challenges in flexible, cost-effective ways.  Through three segments, CoreCivic Safety, CoreCivic Community, and CoreCivic Properties, we provide a broad range of solutions to government partners that serve the public good through corrections and detention management, a growing network of residential reentry centers to help address America's recidivism crisis, and government real estate solutions.  We have been a flexible and dependable partner for government for more than 35 years.  Our employees are driven by a deep sense of service, high standards of professionalism and a responsibility to help government better the public good.
 Structured as a REIT, we are the nation's largest owner of partnership correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities and one of the largest prison operators in the United States.  We also believe we are the largest private owner of real estate used by U.S. government agencies.  As of December 31, 2018, through our CoreCivic Safety segment, we operated 51 correctional and detention facilities, 44 of which we owned, with a total design capacity of approximately 73,000 beds. Through our CoreCivic Community segment, we owned and operated 26 residential reentry centers with a total design capacity of approximately 5,000 beds.  In addition, through our CoreCivic Properties segment, we owned 27 properties leased to third parties and used by government agencies, totaling 2.3 million square feet.  
 In addition to providing fundamental residential services, our correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities offer a variety of rehabilitation and educational programs, including basic education, faith-based services, life skills and employment training, and substance abuse treatment.  These services are intended to help reduce recidivism and to prepare offenders for their successful reentry into society upon their release.  We also provide or make available to offenders certain health care (including medical, dental, and mental health services), food services, and work and recreational programs. 
 We are a Maryland corporation formed in 1983.  Our principal executive offices are located at 10 Burton Hills Boulevard, Nashville, Tennessee, 37215, and our telephone number at that location is (615) 263-3000.  Our website address is www.corecivic.com.  We make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, definitive proxy statements, and amendments to those reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC.  Information contained on our website is not part of this Annual Report.
 We began operating as a REIT effective January 1, 2013.  We provide services and conduct other business activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs.  A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that is subject to applicable corporate income tax and certain qualification requirements.  Our use of TRSs enables us to comply with REIT qualification requirements while providing correctional services at facilities we own and at facilities owned by our government partners and to engage in certain other business operations.  A TRS is not subject to the distribution requirements applicable to REITs so it may retain income generated by its operations for reinvestment. 
 As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders, including the income derived from our real estate and dividends we earn from our TRSs. However, our TRSs will be required to pay income taxes on their earnings at regular corporate income tax rates. 
 As a REIT, we generally are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains). Our REIT taxable income will not typically include income earned by our TRSs except to the extent our TRSs pay dividends to the REIT.

Our ongoing operations are organized into three principal business segments:
  
• | CoreCivic Safety segment, consisting of 51 correctional and detention facilities that are owned, or controlled via a long-term lease, and managed by CoreCivic, as well as those correctional and detention facilities owned by third parties but managed by CoreCivic. CoreCivic Safety also includes the operating results of our subsidiary that provides transportation services to governmental agencies, TransCor America, LLC, or TransCor.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CoreCivic Community segment, consisting of 26 residential reentry centers that are owned, or controlled via a long-term lease, and managed by CoreCivic. CoreCivic Community also includes the operating results of our electronic monitoring subsidiaries, Rocky Mountain Offender Management Systems, LLC, or RMOMS, and Recovery Monitoring Solutions Corporation, or RMSC. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CoreCivic Properties segment, consisting of 27 real estate properties owned by CoreCivic and leased to, and operated by, third parties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our total facility net operating income, which we define as a facility's revenues less operating expenses, was divided among our three business segments as follows:
 
 
 | For the Years Ended December 31, | 
-----------+----------------------------------+-----
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
Segment: | | | | | | | | 
Safety | | 87.1 | % | | 90.0 | % | 91.6 | %
Community | | 4.8 | % | | 4.4 | % | 3.2 | %
Properties | | 8.1 | % | | 5.6 | % | 5.2 | %

 Our customers primarily consist of federal, state, and local government agencies.  Federal correctional and detention authorities primarily consist of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or the BOP, the United States Marshals Service, or the USMS, and ICE.  Payments by federal correctional and detention authorities represented 48%, 48%, and 52% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
 Our customer contracts for providing bed capacity and correctional, detention, and residential reentry services in our CoreCivic Safety and CoreCivic Community segments typically have terms of three to five years and contain multiple renewal options.  Most of our facility contracts also contain clauses that allow the government agency to terminate the contract at any time without cause, and our facility contracts are generally subject to annual or bi-annual legislative appropriations of funds.  Notwithstanding these termination clauses, the contract renewal rate for properties we owned in these segments was 95% over the five years ended December 31, 2018. The government lease agreements in our CoreCivic Properties segment typically have terms of five to twenty years including renewal options, and generally have more restrictive termination clauses. At December 31, 2018, the lease agreements in our CoreCivic Properties segment had a weighted average lease term of 6.5 years remaining.
 In our CoreCivic Safety and CoreCivic Community segments, we are compensated for providing bed capacity and correctional, detention, and residential reentry services at a per diem rate based upon actual or minimum guaranteed occupancy levels.  Occupancy rates for a particular facility are typically low when first opened or immediately following an expansion.  However, beyond the start-up period, which typically ranges from 90 to 180 days, the occupancy rate tends to stabilize.  The average compensated occupancy of our correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities, based on rated capacity was as follows for the years 2018, 2017, and 2016:
 
 
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
-------------------------------+------+----+---+------+----+-----
CoreCivic Safety facilities | | 81 | % | | 80 | % | 79 | %
CoreCivic Community facilities | | 80 | % | | 80 | % | 75 | %
Total | | 81 | % | | 80 | % | 79 | %

 
The average compensated occupancy of our CoreCivic Safety and CoreCivic Community facilities, excluding idled facilities, was 93%, 91%, and 88% for the years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

In our CoreCivic Properties segment, we own properties leased to third parties and used by government agencies where our occupancy percentage is based on leased square feet rather than bed capacity.  The occupancy of these facilities was as follows for the years 2018, 2017, and 2016:
 
 
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016

Operating Procedures and Offender Services for Correctional, Detention, and Residential Reentry Facilities
 Pursuant to the terms of our customer contracts, we are responsible for the overall operations of our facilities, including staff recruitment, general administration of the facilities, facility maintenance, security, and supervision of the offenders.  We are required by our customer contracts to maintain certain levels of insurance coverage for general liability, workers' compensation, vehicle liability, and property loss or damage.  We also are required to indemnify our customers for claims and costs arising out of our operations and, in certain cases, to maintain performance bonds and other collateral requirements.  
 Reentry programs.
 We believe a focus on inmate reentry provides great benefits for our communities – more people living healthy and productive lives and contributing to strong families and local economies.  We have committed to evolving our model with an increased focus on reentry services, and we are working hard to equip the men and women in our care with the services, support, and resources they need to be successful upon reentry.
 We provide a wide range of evidence-based reentry programs and activities in our facilities.  At most of the facilities we manage, offenders have the opportunity to enhance their basic education from literacy through earning a high school equivalency diploma endorsed by their respective state. In some cases, we also provide opportunities for postsecondary educational achievements and chances to participate in college correspondence classes.  A number of our facilities that care for non-citizens offer adult education curricula recognized by several nations to which these offenders may return, including a curriculum offered in conjunction with the Mexican government.  We also provide the Adult Education in Spanish program for offenders with that specific language need.
 For the offenders who are close to taking their high school equivalency exam (either the GED or the HiSET), we have invested in the equipment needed to use the GED/HiSET Academy software program, which is an offline software program providing over 200 hours of individualized lessons up to the 12th grade. The GED/HiSET Academy incorporates teaching best practices and provides an atmosphere to engage and motivate students to learn everything they need to know to pass the GED/HiSET exam. As an example of the impact we are having, during 2018, the number of offenders in our facilities who passed high school equivalency exams totaled 1,653.  From July 2017 through June 2018, our Crowley County Correctional Facility led the state system in Colorado in GED completions.  According to research from the independent RAND Corporation, "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education" published in 2013, inmates who obtain GEDs while in prison are 30% less likely to return to prison.
 In addition, we offer a broad spectrum of career/technical education opportunities to help individuals learn marketable job skills. Our trade programs are certified by the National Center for Construction Education and Research, or NCCER.  NCCER establishes the curriculum and certification for over 4,000 construction and trade organizations.  Graduates of these programs enter the job market with certified skills that significantly enhance employability.  According to research conducted by the RAND Corporation, inmates who complete vocational training are 28% more likely to find a job after release. During 2018, 4,712 offenders in facilities we manage earned career and technical education certificates.  We are proud of the educational programs we offer and intend to maintain and continue to develop such programs. For example, in 2018, through a partnership with Fuel Education, a company that specializes in digital learning opportunities, we began offering an online Information Support and Services computer program at our Lee Adjustment Center in Kentucky. This program allows students to enhance their computer knowledge and was developed in coordination with the Kentucky Department of Corrections, our government partner at the Lee facility.  Students who successfully complete the approximate 10-month program will be awarded a base National Occupational Competency Testing Institute, or NOCTI, credential with the opportunity 
 7


to earn an advanced NOCTI credential in the future.  In addition, near the end of 2016, our Coffee and Wheeler facilities in Georgia implemented state-of-the-art Diesel Maintenance and Welding programs in coordination with the Georgia Department of Corrections, enabling students to earn trade certificates from nearby community colleges.  As of December 31, 2018, these programs have graduated 49 from the Diesel Maintenance program and 103 from the Welding program.   
 For those with assessed substance use disorders, we offer cognitive evidence-based treatment programs with proven clinical outcomes, such as the Residential Drug Abuse Program.  We offer both Residential Therapeutic Community models and intensive outpatient programs.  We also offer drug and alcohol use education/DWI programs at some of our locations.  Our goal in providing substance use treatment is to stimulate internal motivation for change and progress through the stages of change so that lasting behavioral alterations can occur.  Our drug and alcohol education programs help participants understand their relationships with drugs and alcohol and the links between drug and alcohol use and crime, as well as assisting them in making better choices that can lead to healthier relationships in their lives.  According to a study performed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, or CDCR, inmates who complete addiction treatment in prison are 50% less likely to return to prison.  In 2018, 2,023 offenders in our care completed substance use disorder programming.
 Additional program offerings include our Victim Impact Programs, available at a number of our facilities, which seek to educate offenders about the negative effects their criminal conduct can have on others.  Currently, 22 of our facilities have received training to offer Victim Impact Programs to offenders in both secure and community sites.  In 2018, 996 offenders successfully completed Victim Impact Programs.  All of our facilities offer opportunities for worship and/or study for a wide range of faith traditions represented in our populations.  Additionally, in many facilities, we offer faith-based programs, with an emphasis on reentry, character development, and spiritual growth.  During 2017, we transitioned to the Threshold Program, a multi-faith, evidence-based model, for our faith-based reentry component. In 2018, 868 offenders in our care successfully completed the Threshold Program.
 Our Reentry and Life Skills programs prepare individuals for life after incarceration by teaching them how to successfully conduct a job search, how to manage their budget and financial matters, parenting skills, and relationship and family skills.   Equally significant, we offer cognitive behavioral programs aimed at changing anti-social attitudes and behaviors in offenders, with a focus on altering the level of criminal thinking.  In 2017, we introduced a comprehensive reentry strategy we call "Go Further", a forward thinking, process approach to reentry.  "Go Further" embraces all facility reentry programs, adds a proprietary cognitive/behavioral curriculum, and encourages staff and offenders to take a collaborative approach to assist in reentry preparation.  "Go Further" is currently in place in 13 of our facilities, with plans to add additional facilities in 2019.  As of December 31, 2018, offenders in our care had completed 2,521 cognitive/behavioral evidence-based journals in preparation for returning to their communities. 
 Across the country, our dedicated staff, along with the assistance of thousands of volunteers, work to provide guidance, direction, and post-incarceration services to the men and women in our care.  We believe these critical reentry programs help fight the serious challenge of recidivism facing the United States.  
 Through our community corrections facilities, we provide an array of services to defendants and offenders who are serving their full sentence, the last portion of their sentence, waiting to be sentenced, or awaiting trial while supervised in a community environment.  We offer housing and programs with a key focus on employment, job readiness, life skills and various substance abuse treatment programs, in order to help offenders successfully reenter their communities and reduce the risk of recidivism.  In some of our community corrections facilities, we offer housing and program services to parolees who have completed their sentence but lack a viable reentry plan.  Through a focus on employment and skill development, we provide a means for these parolees to successfully reintegrate into their communities.
 In addition, we provide day-reporting and outpatient substance abuse treatment programs at some of our community corrections facilities.  These programs, depending on the needs of the offender, can provide cognitive behavioral-based programs to assist in the offender's successful reentry while holding the individual accountable while living in the community.

Lastly, we also provide a number of non-residential correctional alternative services, including electronic monitoring and case management services, under our CoreCivic Community segment.  Governmental customers use electronic monitoring products and services to monitor low risk offenders as a way to help reduce overcrowding in correctional facilities, as a monitoring and sanctioning tool, and to promote public safety by imposing restrictions on movement and serving as a deterrent for alcohol usage.  Providing these non-residential services is a natural complement to our broad network of residential reentry facilities and can help keep individuals from going back to prison or being incarcerated in the first place.
 Ultimately, the work we do is intended to give people the tools to reintegrate with their communities permanently.  We are proud of the teachers, counselors, case managers, chaplains, and other inmate support service professionals who provide these extensive services to the men and women entrusted in our care.  
 To further underscore our long-term commitment to reducing recidivism, in October 2017, we announced that we launched a nationwide initiative to advocate for a range of government policies that will help former offenders successfully reenter society and stay out of prison. We believe that as successful as we may be with our work inside our facilities, offenders still face embedded societal barriers when they return to their communities.  Supporting recidivism-reducing policies is one way we can bridge the gap and give the men and women entrusted in our care a better opportunity at never returning to prison.  As part of the initiative, we apply government relations resources and expertise to advocate for the following policies:
  
• | "Ban-the-Box" proposals to help improve former inmates' chances at getting a job;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced legal barriers to make it easier and less risky for companies to hire former inmates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased funding for reentry programs in areas such as education, addiction treatment, faith-based offerings, victim impact and post-release employment; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Social impact bond pilot programs that tie contractor payments to positive outcomes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Operating guidelines.
 The American Correctional Association, or ACA, is an independent organization comprised of corrections professionals that establishes accreditation standards for correctional and detention institutions.  Outside agency standards, such as those established by the ACA, provide us with the industry's most widely accepted operational guidelines.  ACA accredited facilities must be audited and re-accredited at least every three years.  We have sought and received ACA accreditation for 37, or approximately 93%, of the eligible facilities we operated as of December 31, 2018, excluding our residential reentry facilities.  During 2018, 15 of the facilities we manage were re-accredited by the ACA with an average score of 99.6%, making our portfolio average 99.5%.
 Beyond the standards provided by the ACA, our facilities are operated in accordance with a variety of company and facility-specific policies and procedures, as well as various contractual requirements.  Many of these policies and procedures reflect the high standards generated by a number of sources, including the ACA, the National Commission on Correctional Healthcare, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as federal, state, and local government codes and regulations and longstanding correctional procedures.  
 In addition, our facilities are operated in compliance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act, or PREA, standards, which became effective in August 2013.  All confinement facilities covered under the PREA standards must be audited at least every three years to be considered compliant with PREA. Covered facilities include adult prisons and jails, juvenile facilities, lockups (housing detainees overnight), and community confinement facilities, whether operated by the United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, or by a state, local, corporate, or nonprofit authority. We utilize DOJ-certified PREA auditors to help ensure that all facilities operate in compliance with applicable PREA regulations.
 Our facilities operate under these established standards, policies, and procedures, and also are subject to annual audits by our Quality Assurance Division, or QAD, which operates under the auspices of, and reports directly to, our Office of General Counsel and independently from our Operations Division. Through the QAD, we have devoted significant resources to ensuring that our facilities meet outside agency and accrediting organization standards and guidelines.  
 9


The QAD employs a team of full-time auditors, who are subject matter experts from all major disciplines within institutional operations.  Annually, without advance notice, QAD auditors conduct on-site evaluations of each CoreCivic Safety facility we operate using specialized audit tools, typically containing more than 1,000 audit indicators across all major operational areas.  In most instances, these audit tools are tailored to facility and partner specific requirements.  In addition, audit teams often work with facilities to address specific areas of need, such as meeting requirements of new partner contracts or providing detailed training of new departmental managers.
 The QAD management team coordinates overall operational auditing and compliance efforts across all correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities we manage.  In conjunction with subject matter experts and other stakeholders having risk management responsibilities, the QAD management team develops performance measurement tools used in facility audits. The QAD management team provides governance of the corrective action plan process for any items of nonconformance identified through internal and external facility reviews. Our QAD also contracts with teams of ACA certified correctional auditors to evaluate compliance with ACA standards at accredited facilities.  Similarly, the QAD routinely incorporates a review of facility compliance with key PREA regulations during audits of company facilities.
 In addition to our own internal audit and contract compliance efforts, we are also subject to oversight by our government partners.  As part of their standard monitoring and compliance programs, approximately 65% of our partners conduct formal contract-compliance audits and inspections at least annually.  In addition to these annual audits of our facilities, many partners conduct additional area-specific operational audits and inspections on a more frequent basis, including monthly, quarterly, and semi-annually.  Some of these audits and facility inspections by our partners are conducted on an unannounced basis. A significant number of our contracts with federal and state partners also have on-site contract monitors. These individuals are employed by the government partner to monitor performance and contract compliance at our facilities on a continuous basis.  In 2018, our government partners conducted over 260 annual, semi-annual, quarterly, and monthly compliance audits and inspections at our CoreCivic Safety facilities.
 Business Development
 We believe we own, or control via a long-term lease, approximately 59% of all privately owned prison beds in the United States, manage nearly 39% of all privately managed prison beds in the United States, and are currently the second largest private owner and provider of community corrections services in the nation.  We also believe that we are the largest private owner of real estate used by U.S. government agencies.  Under the direction of our partnership development department, we market our facilities and services to government agencies responsible for federal, state, and local correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities in the United States.  Under the direction of our real estate department, we intend to continue pursuing the acquisition and development of additional correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities, as well as other government-leased real estate assets with a bias toward those used to provide mission-critical governmental services that we believe have a favorable investment return, diversify our cash flows, and increase value to our stockholders.
 We execute cross-departmental efforts to market CoreCivic Safety solutions to government partners that seek corrections and detention management services, CoreCivic Community solutions to government partners seeking residential reentry services, and CoreCivic Properties solutions to customers that need real estate and maintenance services.  We also offer government partners a combination of these business offerings, and currently have two government partners utilizing all three.

As indicated by the following chart, business from our federal customers, including primarily the BOP, USMS, and ICE, continues to be a significant component of our business, although the source of revenue is derived from many contracts at various types of properties, i.e. correctional, detention, reentry, and leased.  The USMS and ICE accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue during the last three years.  


Certain of our contracts with federal partners contain clauses that guarantee the federal partner access to a minimum bed capacity in exchange for a fixed monthly payment.  However, these contracts also generally provide the government the ability to cancel the contract for non-appropriation of funds or for convenience. 
 The solutions we provide to our federal customers continue to be a significant component of our business, yet remained stable as a percentage of our total revenue during 2018 when compared to 2017. We believe our ability to provide flexible solutions and fulfill emergent needs of our federal customers would be very difficult and costly to replicate in the public sector.
 State revenues from contracts at correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities that we operate constituted 39%, 41%, and 38% of our total revenue during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and decreased 2.9% from $727.8 million during 2017 to $706.8 million during 2018.  No state partner accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue during these years.
 Several of our state partners are projecting improvements in their budgets which has helped us secure recent per diem increases at certain facilities.  Further, several of our existing state partners, as well as prospective state partners, are experiencing growth in inmate populations and overcrowded conditions, or are considering alternative correctional capacity for their aged and inefficient infrastructure.  Although we can provide no assurance that we will enter into any new contracts, we believe we are well positioned to provide states with needed bed capacity, as well as the programming and reentry services they are seeking.  Over the previous 24 months, we have entered into new contracts with Ohio, Kentucky, Nevada, South Carolina, Kansas, and Vermont, while Wyoming has begun utilizing an existing contract it had not utilized in nearly a decade.   
 We believe the long-term growth opportunities of our business remain attractive as government agencies consider their emergent needs, as well as the efficiency and offender programming opportunities we provide, as flexible solutions to satisfy our partners' needs.  Further, we expect our partners to continue to face challenges in maintaining old facilities, developing new facilities, and expanding current facilities for additional capacity, which could result in increased future demand for the solutions we provide. Finally, as further described hereafter, we continue to identify attractive investment opportunities for government-leased properties, and expect to complete additional acquisitions that will diversify our cash flows, generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders, and broaden the solutions we are able to provide to our partners.

11


We believe that we can further develop our business by, among other things:
  
• | Maintaining and expanding our existing customer relationships and filling existing beds within our facilities, while maintaining an adequate inventory of available beds that we believe provides us with flexibility and a competitive advantage when bidding for new management contracts;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhancing the terms of our existing contracts and expanding the services we provide under those contracts;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing additional opportunities to lease our facilities to government and other third-party operators in need of correctional, detention, and residential reentry capacity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing mission-critical real estate solutions for government agencies including, but not limited to, corrections and detention real estate assets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing other asset acquisitions and business combinations through transactions with non-government third parties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintaining and expanding our focus on community corrections and reentry programming that align with the needs of our government partners;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing additional opportunities that expand the scope of non-residential correctional alternative solutions we provide to government agencies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establishing relationships with new customers that have either previously not outsourced their correctional facility management needs or have utilized other private enterprises.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We generally receive inquiries from or on behalf of government agencies that are considering outsourcing the ownership and/or management of certain facilities or that have already decided to contract with a private enterprise.  When we receive such an inquiry, we determine whether there is an existing need for our correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities and/or services and whether the legal and political climate in which the inquiring party operates is conducive to serious consideration of outsourcing.  Based on these findings, an initial cost analysis is conducted to further determine project feasibility.
 Frequently, government agencies responsible for correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities and services procure space and services through solicitations or competitive procurements.  As part of our process of responding to such requests, members of our management team meet with the appropriate personnel from the agency making the request to best determine the agency's needs.  If the project fits within our strategy, we submit a written response. A typical solicitation or competitive procurement requires bidders to provide detailed information, including, but not limited to, the space and services to be provided by the bidder, its experience and qualifications, and the price at which the bidder is willing to provide the facility and services (which services may include the purchase, renovation, improvement or expansion of an existing facility or the planning, design and construction of a new facility). The requesting agency selects a provider believed to be able to provide the requested bed capacity, if needed, and most qualified to provide the requested services, and then negotiates the price and terms of the contract with that provider.

2018 Accomplishments
 In 2018, we entered into a number of new contracts, renewed several other significant contracts, and completed numerous other transactions and milestones, including the following:
 CoreCivic Safety:
  
• | Accepted approximately 100 offenders from the state of Wyoming at our 2,672-bed Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Mississippi under an out-of-state contract not used since 2010.

Facility Portfolio
 General
 Our correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities can generally be classified according to the level(s) of security at such facility.  Minimum security facilities have open housing within an appropriately designed and patrolled institutional perimeter.  Medium security facilities have either cells, rooms or dormitories, a secure perimeter, and some form of external patrol.  Maximum security facilities have cells, a secure perimeter, and external patrol.  Multi-security facilities have various areas encompassing minimum, medium or maximum security.  
 Our facilities can also be classified according to their primary function.  The primary functional categories are:
  
• | Correctional Facilities. Correctional facilities care for and provide contractually agreed upon programs and services to sentenced adult prisoners, typically prisoners on whom a sentence in excess of one year has been imposed. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Detention Facilities. Detention facilities care for and provide contractually agreed upon programs and services to (i) individuals being detained by ICE, (ii) individuals who are awaiting trial who have been charged with violations of federal criminal law (and are therefore in the custody of the USMS) or state criminal law, and (iii) prisoners who have been convicted of crimes and on whom a sentence of one year or less has been imposed. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Residential Facilities. Residential facilities provide space and residential services in an open and safe environment to adults with children who have been detained by ICE and are awaiting the outcome of immigration hearings or the return to their home countries. As contractually agreed upon, residential facilities offer services including, but not limited to, educational programs, medical care, recreational activities, counseling, and access to religious and legal services. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Community Corrections. Community corrections/residential reentry facilities offer housing and programs to offenders who are serving the last portion of their sentence or who have been assigned to the facility in lieu of a jail or prison sentence, with a key focus on employment, job readiness, and life skills.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leased Facilities. Leased facilities are properties that are owned and leased to third parties and used by government agencies.

(A) | Design capacity measures the number of beds, and accordingly, the number of offenders each facility is designed to accommodate. Facilities housing detainees on a short-term basis may exceed the original intended design capacity due to the lower level of services required by detainees in custody for a brief period. From time to time, we may evaluate the design capacity of our facilities based on the customers using the facilities, and the ability to reconfigure space with minimal capital outlays. We believe design capacity is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operations in our CoreCivic Safety and CoreCivic Community segments, because the revenue generated by each facility is based on a per diem or monthly rate per offender cared for at the facility paid by the corresponding contracting governmental entity. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(B) | We manage numerous facilities that have more than a single function (i.e., housing both long-term sentenced adult prisoners and pre-trial detainees). The primary functional categories into which facility types are identified was determined by the relative size of offender populations in a particular facility on December 31, 2018. If, for example, a 1,000-bed facility cared for 900 adult offenders with sentences in excess of one year and 100 pre-trial detainees, the primary functional category to which it would be assigned would be that of correctional facilities and not detention facilities. It should be understood that the primary functional category to which multi-user facilities are assigned may change from time to time.

Competitive Strengths
 Through our three segments, CoreCivic Safety, CoreCivic Community, and CoreCivic Properties, we offer multiple solutions to unique challenges, allowing government organizations to address their various needs while customizing the solution based on their unique circumstances.  Accordingly, we believe that we benefit from the following competitive strengths:
 Largest Private Owner of Real Estate used by Government Agencies. We own, or control via a long-term lease, approximately 16.0 million square feet of real estate, all used directly or indirectly by government agencies, which we believe makes us the largest private owner of real estate used by U.S. government agencies.  Our complementary set of business assets provide critical infrastructure and services under contracts with federal, state, and local government agencies that generally have credit ratings of single-A or better, which also contributes to our steady, predictable cash flows.  
 In our CoreCivic Safety segment, we own, or control via a long-term lease, 13.0 million square feet of real estate used to provide innovative, comprehensive, flexible, turn-key correctional and detention services to federal, state and local government agencies.  As of December 31, 2018, our CoreCivic Safety segment operated 51 facilities, 44 of which we owned, with a total design capacity of 72,833 beds, making us the nation's largest private prison owner and one of the largest prison operators in the United States.  Eight of our prison facilities are currently idle, containing 9,814 beds, and are available for growth opportunities.  Our CoreCivic Safety segment generated 87.1% of our total facility net operating income during 2018. 
 In our CoreCivic Community segment, we own, or control via a long-term lease, 0.7 million square feet of real estate representing, as of December 31, 2018, 26 residential reentry centers with a design capacity of 5,214 beds, making us the second largest community corrections owner and operator in the United States.  Our CoreCivic Community segment generated 4.8% of our total facility net operating income during 2018. 
 In our CoreCivic Properties segment, we own 2.3 million square feet of real estate representing, as of December 31, 2018, 27 properties that are leased to third parties and used by government agencies.  Our CoreCivic Properties segment generated 8.1% of our total facility net operating income during 2018.  
 We believe our synergistic set of business segments, combined with our operating strategies, corrections-industry commitment to rehabilitation, extensive government relationships, and deep real estate expertise, provide us with a diversified platform for stable cash flows and sustainable growth, with multiple paths for organic expansions and acquisitions.  
 First and Largest Private Prison Owner.  Through our CoreCivic Safety segment, we are the nation's largest private prison owner and one of the largest prison operators in the United States, which provides us significant credibility with our current and prospective clients.  We believe we own, or control via a long-term lease, approximately 59% 
 24


of all privately owned prison beds in the United States and manage nearly 39% of all privately managed prison beds in the United States.  We pioneered modern-day private prisons with a list of notable accomplishments, such as: 
  
• | the first company to design, build, and operate a private prison;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the first company to manage a private maximum-security facility under a direct contract with the federal government;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the first company to purchase a government-owned correctional facility from a governmental agency in the United States and to manage the facility for the government agency;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the first company to lease a private prison to a state government; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the first company to develop a privately-owned, build-to-suit correctional facility to be operated by a government agency through a long-term lease agreement.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to providing us with extensive experience and institutional knowledge, our size also helps us deliver value to our customers by providing purchasing power and allowing us to achieve certain economies of scale.  
 Available Beds within Our Existing Facilities. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 9,800 beds at eight prison facilities that are vacant and immediately available to use.  We are actively engaged in marketing this available capacity as solutions to meet the needs of potential customers. Historically, we have been successful in substantially filling our inventory of available beds. For example, pursuant to a new management contract we executed in November 2017, the Commonwealth of Kentucky began utilizing our 816-bed Lee Adjustment Center in Kentucky, one of our previously idled prison facilities, in the first quarter of 2018.  
 Well-Established Community Corrections Platform.  Through our CoreCivic Community segment, as of December 31, 2018, we had a network of 26 residential reentry centers containing a total of 5,214 beds.  We offer housing and programs, with a key focus on employment, job readiness and life skills in order to help offenders successfully re-enter the community and reduce the risk of recidivism.  Through our acquisitions in 2018 of RMOMS and RMSC, we also provide non-residential correctional alternatives, including electronic monitoring and case management services, to municipal, county and state governments in nine states.  We expect to continue to pursue opportunities that expand the scope of non-residential correctional alternative solutions available to government agencies.
 We are the second largest community corrections owner and operator in the United States.  We believe this recognition, along with our track record of successful acquisitions and the relationships we have established with owners and potential sellers of reentry facilities, provides us with a platform for further growth and allows us to continue to be an industry consolidator.  In addition, we believe the demand for the housing and programs that community corrections facilities offer will continue to grow as offenders are released from prison and due to an increased awareness of the important role these programs play in an offender's successful transition from prison to society.  We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire additional community corrections facilities in order to provide these services to parolees, defendants, and offenders who are serving their full sentence, the last portion of their sentence, waiting to be sentenced, awaiting trial while supervised in a community environment, or as an alternative to incarceration. We also believe we have the opportunity to maximize utilization of available beds within our community corrections portfolio that would further increase the number of individuals benefiting from the services we provide in such facilities.
 Flexible Real Estate Solutions and Attractive Real Estate Portfolio.  Through our CoreCivic Properties segment, as of December 31, 2018, we owned 27 properties leased to third parties and used by government agencies, totaling 2.3 million square feet.  We offer an extensive network of government relationships and the capability to manage and maintain complex properties, built over our 35-year history.  In addition, we offer our customers an attractive portfolio of facilities that can be leased for various needs as an alternative to providing "turn-key" correctional, detention, and residential reentry bed space and services to our government partners.  In May 2016, we entered into a lease with the ODOC for our previously idled 2,400-bed North Fork Correctional Facility.  The lease agreement commenced on July 1, 2016, and includes a five-year base term with unlimited two-year renewal options.  The lease of the North Fork facility, along with the lease of our California City Correctional Center to the CDCR originating in 2013, exemplify our ability to react quickly to our partners' needs with innovative and flexible solutions that make the best use of taxpayer dollars.  We intend to pursue additional opportunities to lease prison facilities to government and other third-party operators in need of correctional capacity.
 25


On January 24, 2018, we entered into a 20-year lease agreement with the KDOC for a 2,432-bed correctional facility we are constructing in Lansing, Kansas.  The new facility will replace the Lansing Correctional Facility, the State's largest correctional complex for adult male inmates, originally constructed in 1863.  This transaction represents the first development of a privately owned, build-to-suit correctional facility to be operated by a government agency through a long-term lease agreement.  We will be responsible for facility maintenance throughout the 20-year term of the lease, at which time ownership will revert to the State.  Construction of the new facility commenced in the first quarter of 2018 with a timeline for completion of approximately 24 months.  With the extensively aged criminal justice infrastructure in the U.S. today, we believe we can bring our flexible solutions like this to other government agencies.
 Further, we acquired 15 properties in 2018 which added approximately 1.1 million square feet to our portfolio of assets that are leased to third parties and used by government agencies.  See "2018 Accomplishments" for a summary of certain of our growth transactions completed during 2018. We intend to pursue additional opportunities to acquire government-leased assets, including residential reentry centers, with a bias toward those used to provide mission-critical governmental services, that we believe have favorable investment returns, diversify our cash flows, and increase value to our stockholders. 
 Attractive REIT Profile.  Key characteristics of our business make us a highly attractive REIT. As of December 31, 2018, we owned or controlled 97 facilities containing approximately 16.0 million square feet which, for the year ended December 31, 2018, generated 97% of our net operating income, or our operating income before general and administrative expenses, asset impairments, depreciation, and amortization. Land and buildings comprise approximately 89% of our gross fixed assets. The weighted average age of our portfolio of facilities in our CoreCivic Safety, CoreCivic Community, and CoreCivic Properties segments is 20, 27, and 19 years, respectively. These valuable assets are located in areas with high barriers to entry, particularly due to the unique permitting and zoning requirements for these facilities.  Further, the majority of our assets are constructed primarily of concrete and steel, generally requiring lower maintenance capital expenditures than other types of commercial properties. 
 We believe we are the largest developer of mission-critical, criminal justice center real estate projects over the past 15 years.  We also believe we are the largest private owner of real estate used by government agencies. We provide space and services under contracts with federal, state, and local government agencies that generally have credit ratings of single-A or better.  In addition, a majority of our contracts have terms between one and five years, and we have experienced customer retention of approximately 95% at facilities we own during the previous five years, which contributes to our relatively predictable and stable revenue base. This stream of revenue combined with our low maintenance capital expenditure requirement translates into steady, predictable cash flow. We believe the REIT structure also provides a high dividend yield to our shareholders compared with other investments.
 Offer Compelling Value to Correctional Agencies.  We believe our government partners seek a compelling value and service offering when selecting an outsourced correctional services provider.  We believe we offer a cost-effective alternative to our government partners by reducing their correctional services costs, including the avoidance of long-term pension obligations and large capital investments in new prison beds.  We endeavor to improve operating performance and efficiency through the following key operating initiatives:  (1) standardizing supply and service purchasing practices and usage; (2) implementing a standard approach to staffing and business practices; (3) improving offender management, resource consumption, and reporting procedures through the utilization of numerous technological initiatives; (4) reconfiguring facility bed space to optimize capacity utilization; and (5) improving productivity. Through ongoing company-wide initiatives, we continue to focus on efforts to contain costs and improve operating efficiencies. 
 In 2017, we launched a nationwide initiative to advocate for a range of government policies that will help former offenders successfully reenter society and stay out of prison.  Through our strong commitment to community corrections and reentry programs, we offer our government partners additional long-term value. Our evidence-based reentry programs, including academic education, vocational training, substance abuse treatment, life skills training, and faith-based programming, are customizable based on partner needs and are applied utilizing best practices and/or industry standards.  Our proprietary reentry process and cognitive/behavioral curriculum, "Go Further", promotes a comprehensive approach to addressing the barriers to a successful return to society. Through our efforts in community corrections and reentry programs, we can provide consistency and common standards across facilities.  We can also serve multiple levels of government on an as-needed basis, all toward reaching the goal we share with 
 26


our government partners of providing offenders with the opportunity to succeed when they are released, making our communities safer, and, ultimately, reducing recidivism.
 We also offer a wide variety of specialized services that address the unique needs of various segments of the offender population.  Because the offenders in the facilities we operate differ with respect to security levels, ages, genders, and cultures, we focus on the particular needs of an offender population and tailor our services based on local conditions and our ability to provide services on a cost-effective basis.
 We believe our government partners and other agencies in the criminal justice sector also seek a compelling value and service offering when pursuing solutions to their unique real estate needs.  We believe our track record of constructing quality assets on time and within budget, our design and construction methods, unique financing alternatives, and our expertise and experience enable us to provide a compelling value proposition for the construction of mission-critical government real estate assets.  We also believe our robust preventive maintenance program included in our service offering significantly reduces the risk of real estate neglect.  We also offer utility management services using environmentally-friendly, state-of-the-art technology.  
 Acquisitions, Development, and Expansion Opportunities.  Several of our existing federal and state partners, as well as prospective state partners, are experiencing growth in offender populations and overcrowded conditions, or are considering alternative correctional capacity for their aged or inefficient infrastructure.  Competing budget priorities often impede our customers' ability to construct new prison beds of their own or update older facilities, which we believe could result in the further need for private sector prison capacity solutions in the long-term. Over the long-term, we would like to see meaningful utilization of our available capacity and better visibility from our customers into their potential future needs before we develop new prison capacity on a speculative basis. We will, however, respond to customer demand and may develop or expand correctional and detention facilities when we believe potential long-term returns justify the capital deployment, like the current expansion of our Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, California.  We are expanding the Otay Mesa facility by 512 beds as a result of long-standing demand from the USMS and ICE, and limited detention capacity in the Southwest region of the United States.  The expansion is expected to be complete during the fourth quarter of 2019 at an estimated cost of approximately $43.0 million.  Both the USMS and ICE currently utilize the Otay Mesa Detention Center under an existing contract that enables both agencies to utilize the additional capacity. 
 We are also pursuing additional investment opportunities in residential reentry centers and other real estate assets with a bias toward those used to provide mission-critical governmental services, as well as other businesses that expand the range of solutions we provide to government partners, and expect to complete additional acquisitions that would further diversify our cash flows and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.  
 Proven Senior Management Team.  Our senior management team has applied their prior experience and diverse industry expertise to improve our operations, related financial results, and capital structure.  Under our senior management team's leadership, we have successfully executed strategies to diversify our business and offer a broader range of solutions to government partners over the past several years resulting in the Company being renamed and rebranded as CoreCivic, created new business opportunities with customers that have not previously utilized the private corrections sector, converted to a REIT, completed several business combination transactions, and successfully completed numerous financing transactions.  
 Financial Flexibility. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash on hand of $52.8 million and $575.3 million available under our revolving credit facility, with a total weighted average effective interest rate of 4.9% on all outstanding debt, while our total weighted average maturity on all outstanding debt was 5.9 years.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, our fixed charge coverage ratio was 5.1x and our debt leverage was 4.0x. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $322.9 million in cash through operating activities, and as of December 31, 2018, we had net working capital of $7.1 million.  
Capital Strategy
 Our business development strategy includes marketing our available beds to existing and potential government partners that seek corrections, detention, and reentry management services.  We may also offer government partners the opportunity to lease our idle facilities as an alternative to providing "turn-key" bed space and services to our 
 27


government partners.  Successful efforts would generate significant cash flows without the need to incur substantial capital expenditures.  
 Our business development strategy also includes mergers and acquisitions, or M&A, activities that will enable us to further expand our network of residential reentry centers, grow our portfolio of government-leased properties, and acquire other businesses that provide complementary services. We will continue to pursue opportunities to help our government partners meet their infrastructure needs, primarily through the development and redevelopment of criminal justice sector assets, but also by acquiring other real estate assets with a bias toward those used to provide mission-critical governmental services, that we believe have favorable investment returns, diversify our cash flows, and increase value to our stockholders.  We will also respond to customer demand and may develop or expand correctional and detention facilities when we believe potential long-term returns justify the capital deployment, like the aforementioned expansion of our Otay Mesa Detention Center.  These business development activities will require capital.  We currently expect to fund these growth opportunities with cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility.  As of December 31, 2018, we had cash on hand of $52.8 million and $575.3 million available under our revolving credit facility.  We may also seek to issue debt or equity securities from time to time when we determine that market conditions and the opportunity to utilize the proceeds from the issuance of such securities are favorable.  We currently anticipate that any proceeds obtained through capital markets transactions would be used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  We will also pursue alternative sources of capital that could include secured indebtedness, subject to limitations set forth in our debt agreements.
 In January 2018, we obtained a $24.5 million non-recourse mortgage note with an interest rate of 4.5%, maturing in 2033, to partially finance the $44.7 million acquisition of Capital Commerce Center, a 261,000 square-foot property located in Tallahassee, Florida.  Additionally, in August 2018, we acquired the 541,000 square-foot SSA-Baltimore office building for a purchase price of $242.0 million.  In connection with the acquisition, we assumed $157.3 million of in-place financing which carries a fixed interest rate of 4.5%, with a balloon payment of $40.0 million due at maturity in 2034. We may obtain or assume additional secured indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of additional government-leased properties like Capital Commerce Center and the SSA-Baltimore office building, where we believe the terms offer attractive alternatives to other forms of capital.
 On April 17, 2018, we entered into the New Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion, replacing our pre-existing $900.0 million revolving credit facility and the associated incremental term loan, which was originally $100.0 million.  The New Credit Agreement provides for a term loan of $200.0 million and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $800.0 million. The New Credit Agreement also contains an "accordion" feature that provides for uncommitted incremental extensions of credit in the form of increases in the revolving commitments or incremental term loans of up to $350.0 million, as we request, and provides additional flexibility by increasing certain permitted investment, disposition, and borrowing thresholds. The New Credit Agreement, among other things, extended the maturity from July 2020 to April 2023, and increased the total leverage covenant from 5.0x to 5.5x.  Interest rate margins, unused facility fees, and commitment fees for letters of credit remain the same under the New Credit Agreement, except for the addition of a new interest rate margin and fee tier to accommodate the increase in the covenant for total leverage from 5.0x to 5.5x.  All other terms remain substantially the same. 
 In April 2018, CoreCivic of Kansas, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, priced the $159.5 million Kansas Notes in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The private placement closed on June 1, 2018. We are using the proceeds of the private placement, which are drawn on quarterly funding dates beginning in the second quarter of 2018, to fund construction of the aforementioned Lansing Correctional Facility, along with costs and expenses of the project.  The Kansas Notes have a yield to maturity of 4.43% and are scheduled to mature in January 2040, approximately 20 years following completion of the project, which is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2020. We may pursue additional private placement transactions similar to the Kansas Notes in the future.
 On August 28, 2018, we entered into an Amended and Restated ATM Equity Offering Sales Agreement, or ATM Agreement, with multiple sales agents, pursuant to which we may offer and sell to or through the agents, from time to time, shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $200.0 million. Sales, if any, of our shares of common stock will be made primarily in “at-the-market” offerings, as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The shares of common stock will be offered and 
 28


sold pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 and a related prospectus supplement, both filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on August 28, 2018.  We believe the ATM program is a useful tool to match fund proceeds from common stock sales with M&A activities and other capital needs, in order to manage our capital allocation strategy.  There were no shares of our common stock sold under the ATM Agreement during 2018. 
 In addition to the secured, non-recourse notes previously described herein, as of December 31, 2018, we had $1,175.0 million principal amount of unsecured notes outstanding with fixed interest rates, including $250.0 million at 4.75% maturing October 2027, $350.0 million at 4.625% maturing May 2023, $250.0 million at 5.0% maturing October 2022, and $325.0 million at 4.125% maturing April 2020.  Each issuance is redeemable at a "make-whole" redemption price prior to three months in advance of the respective maturity, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and thereafter at 100% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.  While we do not currently plan to refinance any of our senior notes prior to the date at which the "make-whole" premium expires, we are currently evaluating various refinancing options for the $325.0 million unsecured notes maturing April 2020.  Such refinancing options include, but are not limited to, repaying the notes with capacity under the revolving credit facility or with net proceeds from exercising the "accordion" feature under the New Credit Agreement. Depending on market conditions, we could also seek to issue additional debt or equity securities, creating additional liquidity for the redemption of the senior notes.
 We reorganized our corporate structure to facilitate our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective for our taxable year beginning January 1, 2013.  To qualify and be taxed as a REIT, we generally are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains), and are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (including capital gains) each year. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions, however, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain qualification and taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs, alternative growth opportunities that require capital deployment, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.  Because as a REIT we are required to distribute a substantial portion of our cash generated from operations to stockholders as a dividend, growth opportunities may require more external capital resources than were required prior to our conversion to a REIT.  During 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.43 in each quarter, totaling $205.7 million for the year, compared with a total of $199.8 million during 2017 and $241.7 million during 2016.  In addition to the cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility, we currently expect our REIT taxable income to be less than our operating cash flow, primarily due to the deductibility of non-cash expenses such as depreciation on our real estate assets.  This liquidity provides us with the flexibility to (i) invest in additional facility acquisitions and developments, which could include acquisitions of facilities from government partners, third parties, or additional business combinations, (ii) pay down debt, (iii) increase dividends to our stockholders, or (iv) repurchase our common stock.

Government Regulation
 Business Regulations
 The industry in which we operate is subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulations, including educational, health care, and safety regulations, which are administered by many governmental and regulatory authorities. Some of the regulations are unique to the corrections industry. Facility management contracts typically include specific staffing requirements, reporting requirements, supervision, and on-site monitoring by representatives of the contracting governmental agencies.  Corrections officers are customarily required to meet certain training standards and, in some instances, facility personnel are required to be licensed and subject to background investigation.  Certain jurisdictions also require us to award subcontracts on a competitive basis or to subcontract with businesses owned by members of minority groups. Our facilities are also subject to operational and financial audits by the governmental agencies with which we have contracts.  Failure to comply with these regulations and contract requirements can result in material penalties or non-renewal or termination of facility management contracts.
Environmental Matters
 Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under, or in such property.  Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.  As an owner of real estate assets and as the result of our operation and management of correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities, we have been subject to these laws, ordinances, and regulations.  Phase I environmental assessments have been obtained on substantially all of the properties we currently own.  We are not aware of any environmental matters that are expected to materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however, if such matters are detected in the future, the costs of complying with environmental laws may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and Privacy and Security Requirements
 In 1996, Congress enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA.  HIPAA was designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage, simplify the administration of health insurance, and protect the privacy and security of health-related information. 
 Privacy regulations promulgated under HIPAA regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, whether communicated electronically, on paper, or orally.  The regulations also provide patients with significant rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed.  Security regulations promulgated under HIPAA require that covered entities, including most health care providers, health clearinghouses, group health plans, and their business associates, implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically.  These privacy and security regulations require the implementation of compliance training and awareness programs for our health care service providers and selected other employees primarily associated with our employee medical plans.  Further, covered entities and their business associates must provide notification to affected individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days from discovery of a breach of unsecured protected health information. Notification must also be made to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. In a final rule released in January 2013, DHHS modified the breach notification requirement by creating a presumption that all non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised.
 Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, which was modified by the 2013 final HITECH rule, strengthened the enforcement provisions of HIPAA. HITECH broadens the applicability of the criminal penalty provisions to employees of covered entities and requires DHHS to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. HITECH also increases the amount of the civil penalties, with penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil penalty of $1,500,000 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. Further, HITECH authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions for injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. In addition, under HITECH, DHHS is required to perform periodic HIPAA compliance audits of covered entities and their business associates. These 
 30


provisions, as modified by the 2013 final HITECH rule, may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues.
 In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing the privacy and security of patient health information and other identifying information. For example, federal and various state laws and regulations strictly regulate the disclosure of patient identifiable information related to substance abuse treatment.  Further, various state laws and regulations require providers and other entities to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving certain types of individually identifiable health or financial information, and these requirements may be more restrictive than the regulations issued under HIPAA and HITECH. Such laws may not be preempted by the HIPAA privacy standards and security standards. These statutes vary and could impose additional penalties and compliance costs.
 Insurance
 We maintain general liability insurance for all the facilities we operate, as well as insurance in amounts we deem adequate to cover property and casualty risks, workers' compensation, and directors and officers liability.  In addition, each of our leases with third parties provides that the lessee will maintain insurance on each leased property under the lessee's insurance policies providing for the following coverages:  (i) fire, vandalism, and malicious mischief, extended coverage perils, and all physical loss perils; (ii) comprehensive general public liability (including personal injury and property damage); and (iii) workers' compensation.  Under each of these leases, we have the right to periodically review our lessees' insurance coverage and provide input with respect thereto.
 Each of our management contracts and the statutes of certain states require the maintenance of insurance.  We maintain various insurance policies including employee health, workers' compensation, automobile liability, and general liability insurance.  Because we are significantly self-insured for employee health, workers' compensation, automobile liability, and general liability insurance, the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on claims experience, and our ability to control our claims experience.  Our insurance policies contain various deductibles and stop-loss amounts intended to limit our exposure for individually significant occurrences.  However, the nature of our self-insurance policies provides little protection for deterioration in overall claims experience or an increase in medical costs.  We are continually developing strategies to improve the management of our future loss claims but can provide no assurance that these strategies will be successful.  However, unanticipated additional insurance expenses resulting from adverse claims experience or an increasing cost environment for general liability and other types of insurance could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.  
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 13,890 full- and part-time employees.  Of such employees, 395 were employed at our corporate offices and 13,495 were employed at our facilities and in our inmate transportation and electronic monitoring businesses.  We employ personnel in the following areas:  clerical and administrative, facility administrators/wardens, security, medical, quality assurance, transportation and scheduling, maintenance, teachers, counselors, case managers, chaplains, and other support services.
 We have not experienced a strike or work stoppage at any of our facilities.  Approximately 1,415 employees at six of our facilities are represented by labor unions.  In the opinion of management, overall employee relations are good.
 Competition
 The correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities we own, operate, or manage, as well as those facilities we own but are managed by other operators, are subject to competition for offenders and residents from other private operators.  We compete primarily on the basis of bed availability, cost, the quality and range of services offered, our experience in the design, construction, and management of correctional and detention facilities, and our reputation.  We compete with government agencies that are responsible for correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities and a number of companies, including, but not limited to, The GEO Group, Inc. and Management and Training Corporation.  We also compete in some markets with small local companies that may have a better knowledge of the local conditions and may be better able to gain political and public acceptance. Other potential competitors may in the future enter into businesses competitive with us without a substantial capital investment or prior experience. We may also compete in the future for acquisitions and new development projects with companies 
 31


that have more financial resources than we have or those willing to accept lower returns than we are willing to accept.  Competition by other companies may adversely affect occupancy at our facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the operating revenue of our facilities.  In addition, revenue derived from our facilities will be affected by a number of factors, including the demand for beds, general economic conditions, and the age of the general population.
We compete with numerous developers, real estate companies and other owners of commercial properties for acquisitions of government-leased assets. Other real estate investors, including insurance companies, private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, other REITs, and other well-capitalized investors will compete with us to acquire government-leased properties. In addition, U.S. Government tenants are viewed as desirable tenants by other landlords because of their strong credit profile, and properties leased to U.S. Government tenant agencies often attract many potential buyers. This competition could increase prices for properties of the type we may pursue and impede our ability to grow and diversify.
