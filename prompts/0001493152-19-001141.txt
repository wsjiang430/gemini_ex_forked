ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Business Overview
 
Algae Dynamics Corp (ADYNF) is focused on the development of proprietary research and products utilizing cannabis oil combined with other botanical and nutraceutical products. The original core of our product development strategy was the extraction of Omega-3 fatty acids from certain strains of algae with high concentrations of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) to create various nutraceutical products. As a result of the many demonstrated health benefits of other botanical oils, most notably cannabis oil, we have developed a strategy aimed at developing products that combined the health benefits of cannabis oils and nutraceutical products, including algae oil. Capitalizing on the burgeoning demand for cannabis oil and other smoke-free alternatives to marijuana consumption, including for medicinal purposes, will help support our ongoing initiatives to create and market research-driven product formulations.
 
In December 2016, we announced a new initiative into the Canadian cannabis industry. We followed that announcement with a press release in March 6, 2018 announcing our intention to build shareholder value through the pursuit of several key initiatives. Over this period, we have continued to assess how to leverage the research and development which was originally focused on the commercialization of our proprietary BioSilo® algae cultivation system and we have decided to suspend our focus on the development of this proprietary technology. In the interim, we will source algae oil for our research-driven product formulations. By doing so, we have eliminated the immediate capital requirements for extraction and formulation equipment. We are now focused on entering into profit sharing business ventures with potential partners who have the appropriate Health Canada licenses to produce and sell medical cannabis formulated products, utilizing our patented formulations which combine cannabis oil and other nutraceutical products developed through our $1.69Million commitment to support university research and previously announced C$400,000 research grant from MITACS, a not-for-profit, Canadian national research organization together with our sponsored research programs with Canadian universities (our Sponsored Research Programs).
 
Strategic Focus
 
During Health Canada’s consultations relating to the cannabis industry and related legislation, they heard many compelling personal stories of how cannabis is making a difference to Canadians living with serious health challenges such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis, arthritis and fibromyalgia. They also heard about the role that cannabis can play in pain management and palliative care, and the relief that cannabis, particularly strains with high levels of CBD and low levels of THC, offers to children with severe forms of epilepsy and how cannabis has enabled patients to limit or eliminate their use of powerful narcotic drugs such as opioids.

Algae Dynamics intends to undergo a significant rebranding exercise to ensure that it is able to communicate its emphasis on the application of cannabis. Beginning with a proposed name change to CanaQuest Medical Corp., our mission is to:
 

(i) | Identify with the help of our research partners appropriate formulations; 
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | Acquire the lowest cost dry cannabis from domestic and international suppliers who have adequate logistics and warehousing capabilities to satisfy our requirements; and 
(iii) | Continue discussions we have already commenced with contract manufacturers who have experience in conducting human trials and commercializing research and development as well as managing supply and risk management including through good manufacturing practices (GMP). 

 
We expect our formulations involving both THC and botanical oil extracts will treat mental health ailments and the advent of our formulations is expected to significantly distinguish our approach from “Licensed Producers” (or licensees authorized to cultivate, process and sell cannabis products) who may not have strong relationships with the University research community which we believe we have cultivated over time through our business objectives. We believe our formulations may have significant potential applications in the treatment of anxiety, addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder “PTSD” and will form a strong foundation to continue to seek other applications through our Sponsored Research Programs. Accordingly, we believe we have developed a strategy to maximize opportunities in an evolving industry that has international scope and opportunity, with Canadian talent through its universities providing a mechanism to make a significant difference in the lives of medical cannabis users.
 
Intellectual Property Protection
 
The Company is undertaking development & commercialization of cannabinoid therapeutic products from strains of cannabis to treat a variety of clinical indications. Through its relationship with Universities, the Company is collaborating to formulate proprietary solutions which significantly impact the effectiveness of cannabis compounds. In addition, we are looking to:

● | Combine the benefits of cannabis and other botanicals; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enhance a highly effective suite of medicinal patented products; and 
● | Utilize formulations which increase absorption capacity. 

Competitive Advantage
 
We believe we have developed a competitive advantage relative to Licensed Producers who may have vertically integrated operations to produce medical applications for cannabis. In particular, we have shown progress in several key areas including:
Clinical Trials:
 

● | Clinical trial data using animal subjects performed by Dr. Laviolette, Western University, has shown positive results. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our focus is targeted to areas that can provide positive, measurable feedback including anxiety, addiction, depression, schizophrenia and PTSD. 
● | Our products are intended to balance THC with other botanical compounds to minimize the euphoric and related side effects. 
● | We expect further product formulations and uses as our Sponsored Research Programs continue. 

Relationships:
 

● | Focused studies by our research partners includes twelve years of cannabis compounding (THC, CBD). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Talented management and sustainability is evident through continuous development and talent retention including seven PhDs and three interns through our Sponsored Research Programs. 
● | Our innovative approach to government funding, including the MITACS $400,000 research grant has built a reputable and collaborative approach between the private and public sector. 
● | Our scientific rather than simply “claims-based” approach provides reviewable clinical data that is attracting attention from leading pharmaceutical firms and producers. 
● | Our primary researcher at Western University, Ontario, Dr. Steve Laviolette, believes that the clinical implications and commercial potential for his formulations are highly significant and has concluded that “since cannabis is commonly prescribed for a host of ailments, including pain, nausea, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis, our formulation will again be hugely significant for the non-mental health patient sectors as well”.

University Affiliations:
 
Our strong and developing relationship with Western University positions us to execute on our business strategy and develop viable, useful products.
 
In particular, we believe researchers at Western University are:
 

● | Ahead of their field with over twelve years of cannabis compound (THC, CBD) research; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Have a strong understanding of the application of THC and CBD compounds to address pain, anxiety, addiction, depression, schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder “PTSD”; 
● | Equipped to realize the benefits of novel proprietary formalizations they developed, and which are eligible for patents which the Company will secure through our research agreements; 
● | In a position to leverage their platform established for ongoing novel formulations and produce relevant clinical trial data with significant results. 

 
In addition, the researchers at the University of Waterloo are exploring other areas that have shown positive results for the use of cannabis including:
 

● | Colorectum, pancreas, breast and prostate cancer; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Ongoing R & D – mitigation of the spread of cancerous tumors; and 
● | Combined application of natural botanicals, algae essential fatty acids, and cannabis oils. 

Distribution
 
Our focus on distribution is intended to position us to meet demand for our formulations which is expected to occur through agreements with Licensed Producers with formulation, packaging and distribution/export (GMP facilities) together with international distribution agreements and strategies to distribute product both domestically and abroad.
Product Development
 
We are positioned to introduce products using both THC dominated formulations with other botanicals, including combinations with plant cannabinoids as well as CBD dominated formulations with other botanicals. We believe that a strategy of introducing a combination of compounds over time and in formulations that are correlated with observed benefits will allow us to penetrate and differentiate ourselves from competitors.
Licensed Producer Partnerships
 
We intend to pursue our business strategy through appropriate licensing arrangements with Licensed Producers. We believe our experience and focus on nutraceutical formulations in the past several years position us to execute this strategy through relationships we have formed and continue to develop.
Next Steps:
 
To fully exploit our competitive advantage, we intend to:
 

● | Sign agreements with Licensed Producers/Distributors to manufacture and/or sell medicinal cannabis domestically and Internationally 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Schedule cannabis deliveries from Jamaican Medical Cannabis Corporation (“JMCC”) for supply of high-volume dry medicinal cannabis for our formulations or for referral to third party Licensed Producers

Medical Cannabis – History and Benefits
 
Cannabis, also known as marijuana, is a family of plants called Cannabaceae. There are over 700 varieties of cannabis that have been described to date. Based on characteristics such as shape, colour, height, smell, etc., usually recognised by two Main types: Cannabis Sativa, which originated in the Western hemisphere and Cannabis Indica, which originated in Central and South Asia. Cannabis as a medicine can be found in the oldest Chinese tradition few thousand years ago, and indications showed different therapeutics use such as for malaria, rheumatic pain, constipation, disorders of reproductive system and many others.
 
Medical Cannabis refers to the use of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids to treat disease or improve symptoms such as pain, muscle spasticity, nausea and other indications. Cannabinoids is a blanket term covering a family of complex chemicals, both natural and man-made, that bind with cannabinoid receptors (protein molecules on the surface of cells) and effect a wide number of responses. Cannabinoid receptors in the human body are part of a system called the Endocannabinoid System. This system produces chemicals called endocannabinoids, which also bind with cannabinoid receptors. Cannabinoid receptors are found in the brain and throughout the body. Scientists have found that cannabinoid receptors in the Endocannabinoid System are involved in a vast array of functions in our bodies, including helping to modulate brain and nerve activity (including memory and pain), energy metabolism, heart function, the immune system and even reproduction. While there are a large number of active cannabinoids found in cannabis, the two most common currently used for medical purposes are THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol).
 
Our proposed cannabis formulations and related nutraceutical products will generally utilize:
 

● | a multiple combination of plant strains to target medical ailments at the neurological level; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the use of cannabis extracted and concentrated cannabinoid oils which are known to provide targeted benefits together with botanical oils and Algae-omega3 essential fatty acids (DHA and EPA); 
● | cannabis extracted and separated terpenes (aroma, additional medicinal benefits); and 
● | cannabis “whole plant” oil – with natural concentrations of THC or CBD. 

 
From research done in the field it has been concluded that THC acts on 2 types of cannabinoid receptors: CB1 and CB2. CB1 receptors are mainly found in the brain, peripheral nerves, and nervous system, whereas CB2 are found both in the neurons and immune cells. Evidence suggests that THC helps alleviate symptoms suffered both by AIDS patients and by cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, by increasing appetite and decreasing nausea. The other main ingredient is CBD, a non-psychoactive component of cannabis which accounts for more than 50% of the known therapeutic applications A range of clinical studies indicated that CBD appears to relieve convulsion, inflammation, anxiety, nausea and short-term memory loss.
 
While THC has a strong binding affinity for both CB1 and CB2 receptors, CBD has no particular binding affinity. Instead, many of the therapeutic benefits of CBD are created through indirect actions. These actions include activating TRPV1 Receptors. These receptors are involved in regulating pain, body temperature, and inflammation. We believe based on our consultations with Dr. Steve Laviolette, that these properties of THC may make it more desirable than CBD alone as it directly and more effectively treats several of these ailments while CBD only has an indirect effect. This is because THC is similar to Endocannabinoids that have a similar structure to naturally occurring Endocannaboids which are also naturally released by neurons in the human body to regulate the release of neurotransmitters.
 
While THC is known to have a positive impact in stabilizing the release of neurotransmitters responsible for PTSD and pain, THC selectively targets molecular and neuropharmacological signaling pathways in both cortical and sub-cortical regions of the brain. In particular, the diminished functioning of GABAergic neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may lead to the loss of control of the PFC to regulate proper sub-cortical dopamine neurotransmission. The action of THC on CB1Rs can impair PFC-CB1R signaling and associated GABAergic functionality leading to dysregulation of the normal prefrontal process. This results in an increase in the extracellular glutamate levels and lower GABA which normally inhibits dopamine production. Understanding this process provides the potential for the development of safer cannabinoid-derived formulations using THC and/or the development of novel THC formulations containing neuroprotectants to mitigate these neuropsychiatric risks. Accordingly, our primary formulation combines THC with specified quantities of a specific botanical extract. While both are naturally occurring products, we believe that our formulation is sufficiently novel as it combines these compounds in specified quantities to create a different neurological result. The specific botanical extract is a unique amino acid and is known to cross the blood-brain barrier. In addition, it may regulate the extracellular glutamine concentration in the neurons and by doing so may properly regulate GABA levels and thus inhibit the release of dopamine. This same formulation may lead to THC replacing opioids: since according to Dr. Steve Laviolette, “the primary addictive effects of opioids are believed to be due to causing a long-term ‘switching on’ of overactive dopamine, our formula would be predicted to be superior to THC alone (which does cause overactive DA similar to opioids), in that our formula prevents this side effect of THC”.

Competitive Landscape
 
The future of medical cannabis lies in medically accepted products for the management of neuropathic pain, hypertension, post-stroke neuroprotection, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, cancer, and other disorders. An example list of publicly traded companies that have entered or are intending to enter the medicinal cannabis markets are listed as follows:

● | Aphria Inc (Canada Licensed Marijuana producer), 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Aurora Cannabis (producer of Cannabis and medicinal solutions following its acquisition of Cannabid Inc.), Bedrocan Cannabis Corp Canada (Pharmaceutical grade medicinal cannabis), Mettrum Health Corp Canada (Licensed producer of medical cannabis), 
● | OrganiGram Holdings Inc (Canada Licensed producer of organic medical marijuana), 
● | Tweed Marijuana Inc. (Canada Licensed producer of medical cannabis), 
● | Cannabis Science, Inc (USA OTC traded biotech company in Colorado), 
● | Medical Marijuana Inc USA (OTC traded business solutions and partnerships), 
● | GW Pharmaceuticals plc UK & USA (Owns a patented (MS) product – Sativex.). 

 
We believe that while there is significant growth in this sector, our patented processes will continue to differentiate us and position us to succeed in this market.
 
Sponsored Research Programs
 
In order to support our mission, we have engaged two prominent Canadian universities to provide research and product development in the use of extracts from cannabis oil and algae oil in the context of cancer, and the development of novel pharmacotherapies for mental health, as follows:
 
1) Dr. Steven Laviolette, BSc, PhD (Addiction Research Group, Dept. of Anatomy & Cell Biology, Dept. of Psychiatry, Canadian Institute for Military and Veterans Health Research), Western University - to perform research and product development on cannabis oil and its constituents in the context of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and schizophrenia.
 
2) Dr. Jonathan Blay, PhD, FRSB, FIBMS, Csci, CBiol (Professor of Pharmacy, University of Waterloo, Professor of Pathology, Dalhousie University), the University of Waterloo – to perform research and product development on cannabis oil and its constituents in the context of the development and treatment of the colorectum, pancreas, breast and prostate cancers.
 
Each research program is a sponsored research program in which the Company pays an agreed amount to each university and in return receives the benefits of the research and the right to acquire the associated intellectual property, based on an agreed fixed payment with no ongoing royalties. The sponsored programs run for three years at the University of Waterloo, at a cost of C$600,000 over the three-year life, and for four years at Western University, at a cost of C$1,000,000 over the life of the program.
 
Western University in Ontario has made significant progress in its research into anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder, drawing on twelve years of cannabis compound research. We believe this work will continue to result in patentable formulations utilizing cannabis oils and other nutraceutical products which we intend to commercialize, license and distribute. Collaborating with prominent Canadian universities is a core part of our plan to develop premium products and add to our portfolio of intellectual property. Through our Sponsored Research Programs, the Company is focusing primarily on the use of extracts from cannabis oil and nutraceutical products for the development of new pharmacotherapies in the context of cancer and for mental health and pain relief. Our intention is to utilize these patents to partner with licensed producers qualified under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (or ACMPR) and the Cannabis Act (collectively, Licensed Producers or LPs) to provide a secure source of cannabis plant material and to jointly produce patented formulated products for sale by the Licensed Producer. The Cannabis Act contains details of the application requirements for licenses and permits, which are similar in nature to the requirements of the ACMPR.

Our near-term revenue generation goal, including until we are ready to outsource the manufacturing of our formulations, is to obtain referral revenue from the sale of medicinal cannabis to Licensed Producers from JMCC our collaboration and cultivation partner (with whom we have signed a Master Supply Agreement) for supply of high-volume dry cannabis for our formulations.
 
Our goals also include expanding research and development work with existing and new Canadian universities, securing supply/service agreements with Licensed Producers, and submitting an application to Health Canada to acquire the necessary licenses to market and sell cannabis and cannabis related medical products as necessary to implement our business objectives. The management team leading these initiatives together with our proposed collaboration partners have the relevant experience ranging from public company management and process experience to successful fund raising and commercialization. We believe that the commercialization of these formulations will lead to significant revenue generating opportunities.
 
In our view, there is a significant market for formulations involving compounds derived from cannabis strains together with other nutraceutical products. There is research to support that Cannabinoid receptors which are part of the endocannabinoid system of the human body and the primary focus of the application of cannabis derived oil compounds as well as algae, are involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory. Accordingly, the Company is generally focused on penetrating the medical marijuana industry both domestically and internationally and believes that its formulations, backed by scientific research produced through its Sponsored Research Programs, will augment the demand and enhance the credibility of medical cannabis products. 
 
Recent Developments in our Commercialization Strategy 
 
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company, through its Sponsored Research Programs, has developed a very unique formulation involving cannabis and other nutraceutical products. We have submitted provisional patent applications for these formulations. The intellectual property (IP) protection of our formulations through appropriate patents will position us to formalize negotiations and eventually enter into domestic and international production and distribution agreements with Licensed Producers, or their equivalent in other jurisdictions. Our discussions with LPs have included production, distribution and related collaborative initiatives involving our specially formulated products and we are confident that the necessary agreements will be negotiated and executed over time so that our formulations can be introduced into the marketplace and complement or expand an increasingly attractive market for medicinal and health related cannabis applications. LPs we have spoken with to date have expressed significant interest but need to evaluate the strength of our patents and related formulations before finalizing licensing and related documentation. However, based on these discussions, we are confident that we will be able to establish relationships with business partners who understand the importance of scientifically backed medicinal cannabis products and the approach taken by Dr. Steven Laviolette, who is the primary researcher at Western University under our Sponsored Research Program and whose formulations will likely be marketed under a new brand name which is still to be determined.
 
We believe we have the potential to secure an enforceable patent for our first formulation (which combines THC and nutraceutical products), to treat mental health ailments. We believe that our new brand will provide us with a strong name brand and trademark to identify our formulations to the public and build brand awareness. In addition, we believe the fact that the combination of active ingredients in our formulations is scientifically backed by Dr. Laviolette’s research should distinguish us from our competitors. We believe these formulations have significant potential applications in the treatment of anxiety, addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder “PTSD” based on his research on animals. Dr. Steven Laviolette, Western University, has indicated to us that, “Since cannabis is commonly prescribed for a host of ailments, including pain, nausea, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis, our formulations will again be hugely significant for the non-mental health patient sectors as well.”

We have three potential formulations – which we have termed the “F” Platforms and two provisional patents which we have filed.
 
F1 – a unique THC + botanical extract formulation which mitigates or eliminates the negative side-effects of THC: e.g. anxiety, depression, paranoia, cognitive/memory deficits. We expect F1 to be an alternative to opioids, thus addressing addiction and dependence and effective for pain management.
 
F2 – a unique CBD + select nutraceutical/dietary additives aimed at synergizing the therapeutic properties of CBD in the treatment of anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, PTSD (chronic stress induced) and addiction.
 
F3 – expansion of research and discovery of the novel formulations utilizing other cannabinoids in addition to THC and CBD will unravel specialized applications for targeted therapies in specific mental health symptom clusters.
 
Capital Requirement
 
In order to execute on our strategy as described above, we estimate an initial capital requirement of US$5.0 million to support activities over the following twelve months, including the following:

1. | Payment to the universities to support the sponsored existing and the new research programs 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Application to Health Canada for sale import/export license under the Cannabis Act 
3. | Professional and other fees in connection with the development of our strategy, negotiations and formalizing agreements with our collaboration partners 
4. | Expenditures related to Human Trials of F1 formula 
5. | Purchase of cannabis 
6. | Working capital to support ongoing operations and research 

 
We have engaged investment bankers to assist with raising the required capital.
 
Legal and Business Context
 
The Company’s business of the development of unique health products and pharmaceuticals that utilize cannabis oils is rigorously regulated. Legal access to medicinal cannabis or medical marijuana has been a gradual and regulated process in Canada, which started as early as 1999 with the granting of exemptions under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada). Following successful court actions in which patients reliant on medical marijuana won legal recognition of their rights to access marijuana as a medicine, the Federal Government implemented the Marijuana Medical Access Regulations (MMAR) in 2001. The MMAR created an initial regime for individuals with a prescription from their health care practitioner in the required form, to possess and use medical marijuana which they grew themselves, or which they purchased from designated producers or a Health Canada supplier.
 
In general, this regime of supply was restrictive, and faced continuing court challenges from users, eventually leading to the implementation of the Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR) in June 2013, providing for an expansion of supply based on a regulated private industry of licensed producers of medical marijuana.
 
Over time, court challenges were also mounted to the restrictions in the MMPR, which initially restricted the products made available by Licensed Producers to only dried marijuana. In 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the restriction making only dried medicinal marijuana available to patients was unconstitutional. In response, the Federal Government broadened the scope of available licenses for Licensed Producers to include the production and sale of cannabis oils as well as fresh marijuana leaves and buds.
 
The ACMPR which was introduced to address these issues provided a more advanced and rigorous regulatory regime for the production, distribution and sale of medical marijuana in Canada, and regulated and contemplated the sale of medical marijuana by Licensed Producers to jurisdictions outside of Canada where the use and sale of medical marijuana and derivatives thereof are legally sanctioned. The ACMPR, like prior regulations, requires patients seeking medical marijuana to obtain medical approval from their health care practitioner and to provide a medical document to a Licensed Producer and have simplified the requirements of the MMPR, offering easier access to medical marijuana in Canada.

The Cannabis Act was passed by the Senate of Canada on June 19, 2018. On June 20, 2018, the Government of Canada officially announced that the production, distribution and sale of cannabis for unqualified adult use will become legal on October 17, 2018, and subsequently on June 21, 2018, the Cannabis Act received royal assent. The commitment by the Government of Canada to implement the Cannabis Act did occur on October 17, 2018. On June 27, 2018, Health Canada established regulations under the Cannabis Act (the “Cannabis Regulations”). As a result, individuals who currently rely upon the medical cannabis market to supply their medical cannabis and cannabis-based products may cease this reliance, and instead turn to the adult-use cannabis market to supply their cannabis and cannabis-based products. The Company believes that its formulations will provide it with a competitive advantage in this market since they will be backed by scientific research and complement or enhance the use of existing medicinal marijuana products. However, the Company will need to ensure that it together with its collaboration partners remain in compliance with the Cannabis Act which provides a licensing and permitting scheme for the production, testing, packaging, labelling, sending, delivery, transportation, sale, possession and disposal of cannabis, which is implemented by the Cannabis Regulations. Provincial legislation will also implement measures authorizing the sale of cannabis that has been produced by a person authorized under the Cannabis Act to produce cannabis for commercial purposes. The licensing, permitting and authorization regime is implemented by the Cannabis Regulations. The Cannabis Act contains some details of the application requirements for licenses and permits, which are similar in nature to the requirements of the ACMPR (e.g. they include requirements for financial information, security information and security clearances). Below are additional highlights of the Cannabis Act:
 

● | set a national minimum age of purchase of 18; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | apply comprehensive restrictions to the advertising and promotion of cannabis and related merchandise; 
● | allow limited promotion in areas accessible by adults, similar to those restrictions under the Tobacco Act (Canada); 
● | require plain packaging for cannabis products that only display the producer company name, strain name, price, amounts of THC and cannabidiol (CBD), and warnings and other labelling requirements; 
● | impose strict sanctions on false or misleading promotion as well as promotion that encourages excessive consumption, where promotion is allowed; 
● | impose requirements to protect children; 
● | impose a price and tax scheme based on potency to discourage purchase of high-potency products; 
● | prohibit mixed products, for example cannabis-infused alcoholic beverages or cannabis products with tobacco, nicotine or caffeine; and 
● | allow for personal cultivation for non-medicinal purposes of up to four plants per residence subject to additional local and safety requirements. 

 
According to Health Canada, more than 98,000 patients had enrolled with Licensed Producers under the ACMPR regime by September 30, 2016. Health Canada also indicates that, as of September 30, 2016, the average amount of dried marijuana for medical purposes authorized per client was 2.6 grams per day. For further information, see the Health Canada website at: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhpmps/marijuana/info/market-marche-eng.php.
 
Further information has recently been released by Canada’s Parliamentary Budget Officer (the “PBO”) in its November 1, 2016 report, which estimates that, in 2018, an estimated 4.6 million individuals aged 15 and over will use cannabis at least once, representing 655 metric tons of cannabis. This number could rise to 5.2 million individuals by 2021, representing 734 metric tons of cannabis. The PBO stated that the pre-tax price of legal cannabis is projected to be between $6.67 and $8.33 per gram, with a mid-point estimate of $7.50. For further information, see “Legalized Cannabis: Fiscal Considerations”, authored by the Office of the PBO and dated November 1, 2016.

Regulatory Pathway
 
Health Canada recently released “Proposed Regulations Amending the Cannabis Regulations (new classes of cannabis) and Proposed Order Amending Schedules 3 and 4 to the Cannabis Act”. These proposed changes introduce three new classes of cannabis products: edibles, concentrates and topicals. The introduction of these new classes may present an opportunity for the Company to bring combination products to the market as an adult-use edible cannabis product. It is proposed that only approved food ingredients and additives will be permitted for use in this class of products – which will require the Company’s additives to qualify under such rules and which may also be influenced by the delivery mechanism for our formulations. Although health claims are not permitted on this type of product, this commercialization option represents the fastest route to market and allows for distribution through both healthcare practitioner-facilitated medical-use channels and recreational channels. Accordingly, our intention is to explore the use of these channels.
 
Currently the only commercialization option that will allow for making health claims and the distribution of literature to healthcare practitioners is as a prescription cannabis drug requiring a Drug Identification Number (DIN). This route requires evidence from human clinical trials that demonstrates the safety and efficacy of the products to allow for premarket authorization by Health Canada. Two cannabis drug products have received Health Canada authorization thus far. To commence a clinical trial program, we will collaborate with experienced partners who are able to obtain the No Objection Letter for the conduct of these studies and the Cannabis Research License required by Health Canada. Building a portfolio of clinical research data on our products will require time; however, has the benefit of gaining broader market acceptance and possibly inclusion on drug formularies approved by insurance providers. 
 
Finally, Health Canada has indicated that further research is required before they will consider authorizing the inclusion of cannabis in self-care products (natural health products, over-the-counter drugs). Health Canada has also published proposed changes to the regulatory framework of self-care products with a plan to issue targeted changes to the Food and Drug Act in early 2019 for public consultation. Although these regulatory changes may not have a direct impact on the oversight of cannabis products at this time, they may also open the possibility of an expedited regulatory pathway for our formulations should an additional category for cannabis self-care products be added in time. Self-care products also require substantiating evidence for efficacy and safety derived from human clinical trials. In commencing a clinical trial program, the Company will be poised to capitalize on any changes that will facilitate the self-care market by already obtaining data to support health claims. 
 
Markets
 
We believe that our focus on development of product formulations that utilize both cannabis oil and nutraceutical products, including algae oils, is a niche strategy that will give us a unique market position and allow further market penetration. While we believe that this strategy is a natural extension of existing, rapidly growing markets, there is limited data available to measure the market opportunity. With that in mind, what follows is a discussion about the cannabis oil market and the algae oil market.
Market for Cannabis Oil
 
The Canadian oil extraction marketplace is forecast to grow from C$1 million in 2015 to C$1.7 billion in 2020, assuming full legalization in 2018. In terms of conversion from dried marijuana to extracts/oil, due diligence has been conducted on the Colorado market, finding that 45% of dried marijuana users would eventually convert to marijuana extracts/oil. The Company assumes the market would gradually reach an approximate 45% conversion rate by 2018. Source: Mackie Research Capital Corporation, April 8, 2016 – MRCC Estimates. In addition, it is estimated that there will be 630,000 (1.7% of the population) registered medical marijuana patients in Canada by 2024, resulting in annual demand of approximately 230,000 kilograms. In 2018, it is estimated the demand by medical marijuana patients will be roughly 95,000 kilograms. Based on these forecasts, it is estimated that by 2024, the value of the Canadian medical marijuana market could be $1.9 billion to $2.6 billion. (source: Mackie Research Capital Corporation (“MRCC”) September 20, 2017). In addition, Germany and Australia and an increasing number of countries are legalizing medical marijuana, like Canada did in 1999, and government officials are making public statements suggesting that the prohibition of marijuana is ineffective policy from a public health, fiscal and social justice perspective. Licensed Canadian companies have considerable operational experience, which can be leveraged to pursue high growth opportunities in the increasing number of federal licensing opportunities in international markets.

Market for Algae Oil
 
The market data for algae oil is brief since our plan is to utilize algae oil in our products largely to the extent that it complements our products that contain cannabis oil. We have suspended the development of our BioSilo® algae cultivation system. However, we believe that there is still scope to leverage the research and expertise gained from our understanding of the medical properties and use of algae oil. In particular, studies have shown that EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), which are long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, are important for proper fetal development, including neuronal, retinal, and immune function. EPA and DHA may affect many aspects of cardiovascular function including inflammation, peripheral artery disease, major coronary events, and anticoagulation. EPA and DHA have been linked to promising results in prevention, weight management, and cognitive function in those with very mild Alzheimer’s disease.

Cannabis by itself has long been used for medical purposes and in recent decades has gained significant traction in becoming a common and preferred treatment for specific ailments. Cannabis is one of the fastest growing industries in North America. The Company’s new strategic initiative will seek product development and formulation opportunities that combine the benefits of botanical oils and cannabis oils and other nutraceutical products. 
 
The Company’s core product development strategy has been previously focused on the production of high-volume specific algae species and extraction of Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) which is the foundation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS is a group of endogenous cannabinoid receptors located in the mammalian brain and throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, consisting of neuromodulatory lipids and their receptors. The extracted algae Omega 3 oil with high concentrations of DHA and EPA is used as a health supplement product. In light of the potential synergies, the Company will continue to develop its strategy to create products and formulations that combine the health benefits of cannabis oils and algae oils.
 
The following are some of the health benefits of algae and cannabis that the Company intends to research further to potentially combine into synergistic products:
 

Algae Omega-3 | Cannabis 
------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------
Detoxes heavy metals and toxins | Reduces stress and anxiety 
Supports immune system | Reduces glaucoma and prevents macular degeneration 
Fights cancer | Prevents certain cancers 
Detoxifies radiation and chemotherapy | Relives pain 
Lowers cholesterol and blood glucose levels | Increases appetite 
Improves cardiovascular function | Stimulates antioxidant processes 
Improves cognitive functioning | Fights multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia 
Fights Alzheimer’s disease | Fights neurodegenerative disorders 
Reduces antiplatelet effects | Reduces migraines and headaches 
Reduces major coronary events | Fights epilepsy 
Acts as an anti-inflammatory agent | Fights obesity and metabolic syndrome 
Improves memory | Fights anorexia and osteoporosis 

Sales and Distribution
 
We intend to develop marketing channels including but not limited to website promotion, medical doctors, product distributors, as appropriate and in compliance with the regulatory requirements. Initially, we intend to manufacture and sell our product formulations mainly through Licensed Producers and target patients, medical doctors, and product distributors, subject to regulatory requirements and restrictions including on the promotion and labelling of medical marijuana products. The Company intends to build brand awareness by working with brand/marketing management professionals, specializing in the medical health market, to have packaged products available for sale to customers.
 
We believe our efforts are starting to derive significant benefits and moving our business plan forward, particularly since our potential partners appear to be seeing the significant value in our first patented product formulation which has been developed as a result of the Sponsored Research Agreement with Dr. Steve Laviolette and Western University. While we were not able to move forward with certain arrangements with Licensed Producers (including 6779264 Manitoba Ltd dba Bonify as previously reported), there have been important developments with several other licensed entities who we may partner with us as follows:
 
Strategic International Licensed Producer: We have executed a Master Cannabis Supply Agreement for medical cannabis product supply with a strategic international licensed grower and producer (JMCC), that has access to a significant supply of low-cost dry cannabis product. As well, the grower is licensed in Jamaica to facilitate the processing and distribution of our medicinal cannabis products internationally, subject to regulatory approvals.

Licensed Producers: We have engaged in several discussions with major Licensed Producers/Distributors to sell medicinal cannabis domestically and Internationally (supplied by our Strategic International Licensed Producer). As well, these companies are reviewing the strength of our IP to potentially facilitate the processing and distribution of our formulations because our formulated products do not compete with their product lines.
 
Licensed Processor/Pharmaceutical Company: We have engaged in several discussions with a major pharmaceutical company, international distributor and GMP manufacturer who has provided highly positive feedback of the approach Dr. Laviolette has adopted in his research and pre-clinical animal trials, the depth of research and the effective integration of the various research departments at Western University. We believe we can leverage their expertise with multiple formulations, delivery systems for improved bioavailability, including by integrating our formulation into soft gels and tablets for timed release of the formulations. We would also expect to take advantage of their supply, processing and distribution capabilities and collaborate further on R & D and human trials for our formulations.
 
We have reviewed our strategy and believe it is more efficient to partner with existing Licensed Producers who have facilities compliant with good manufacturing practices (GMP) necessary for the preparation of our formulations. Additionally, we are seeking our own purchase/sales, import/export license without possession under the Cannabis Act to distribute formulations and develop our brand as permitted under the Cannabis Act Regulations. We do not require similar special licensing with respect to algae-only related sales.
 
The Company’s strategy to achieve revenue can be summarized as follows:
 

● | We expect revenue generation from referral fees generated by our introduction of JMCC to licensed sellers of high volume dry medical cannabis and have signed a Supply Agreement with JMCC for that purpose. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We expect to generate additional revenue from our formulated products through our agreements with licensed partners. 
● | We expect to provide a very specialized and unique patentable product, with more novel and patentable products to be produced over time. 
● | We expect to secure a robust sales and distribution network and expand the network over time. 
● | We expect to identify worldwide markets for our formulations. 

 
While we have been in business since 2008, we have not generated any revenues to date. Our activities have been principally directed towards development of our BioSilo® algae cultivation system, as well as proving the ability of the system to scale to a level sufficient to meet commercial demand that may develop. The change in the strategy has been very much assisted by the knowledge gained from the algae cultivation plus the relationships which we have developed. The revised strategy is being very well received by suppliers and distributors as there are a number of firms who have expressed an interest to supply cannabis material for our products and to distribute it given that it has a strong basis in science and research performed through our Sponsored Research Program. These firms are also willing to enter into agreements to market the formulated product.
 
The Company is in the development stage and has not yet realized profitable operations and has relied on non- operational sources to fund operations. The Company has suffered recurring losses and additional future losses are anticipated as the Company has not yet been able to generate revenue. In addition, as of March 31, 2018, the Company has a working capital deficiency of $870,053 (March 31, 2017 - $852,514) and an accumulated deficit of $7,219,908 (March 31, 2017 - $6,134,941). The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on successfully executing its business plan, which includes the raising of additional funds. The Company will continue to seek additional forms of debt or equity financing, but it cannot provide assurances that it will be successful in doing so. These circumstances raise substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to meet its obligations as they come due and accordingly, the appropriateness of the use of accounting principles applicable to a going concern. The financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material.

We continue to rely on advances and sale of equity to fund operating shortfalls and do not foresee a change in this situation in the immediate future. There can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to access advances and sales of equity, without which we will not be able to continue operations. We are pursuing additional sources of financing, but there is no assurance that additional capital will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all.
 
Marketing Strategies and Competition
 
Advertising and marketing of medical marijuana in Canada is regulated by the Cannabis Act, Food and Drugs Act (Canada) and the Narcotic Control Regulations issued under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada). Licensed Producers are strictly prohibited from advertising marijuana products or promoting their use.
 
Our marketing activities will be focused on the promotion of the Company and increasing its visibility within the marketplace. Those efforts will include working with numerous client education centers (patient aggregators), which will review the available research data provided by the universities on medical cannabis oils and products available to clients. We believe this scientific data will help clients make educated decisions.
 
We believe we will have significant advantages in the market that will include multiple strain selection and consistently-produced cannabis oil products backed by scientific research that supports the improved effectiveness of each treatment.
 
Research and Product Development Relationships and Scientific Advisors
 
Dr. Steven Laviolette, BSc, PhD (Addiction Research Group, Dept. of Anatomy & Cell Biology, Dept. of Psychiatry, Canadian Institute for Military and Veterans Health Research), University of Western Ontario - performs research and product development on cannabis oil and its constituents in the context of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and schizophrenia.
 
Research/Expertise:
 
Dr. Laviolette’s research interests explore the interface between neurobiology, psychology and emotion by using an integrative combination of in vivo neuronal electrophysiology and behavioral neuropharmacology. At the general level, Dr. Laviolette is interested in exploring the neurobiological mechanisms that control how the brain processes emotionally salient information and how disturbances in these basic neural processes may lead to disorders such as addiction and schizophrenia.
 
Dr. Laviolette’s investigations into the neurobiology of addiction have focused on nicotine and opiates, both of which represent highly addictive substances and act on pathways in the brain that control reward, motivation and learning. Dr. Laviolette’s research group has characterized and identified specific regions in the mammalian brain that control the ‘switch’ from the non-addicted state, to the addicted state following exposure to drugs of abuse. Their ongoing research seeks to precisely define and identify the neurobiological mechanisms that control the addiction process at the behavioral, molecular and single neuron levels of analysis.
 
In addition, Dr. Laviolette’s research group is interested in exploring the neuronal mechanisms of emotional associative learning both in single neurons and in specific brain circuits. They have focused on the roles of the endocannabinoid system and specific dopamine receptor populations in the processing of emotionally salient information. Their ongoing research seeks to examine how disturbances in these brain receptor substrates may underlie the distorted sensory processing and emotional associative learning observed in individuals with schizophrenia.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Mechanisms of metastasis and its regulation by proteins at the cell surface; and 
● | Development of drugs (both synthetic and natural product-derived) that interfere with cancer metastasis. 

 
Dr. Blay’s research group applies a range of techniques in molecular and cellular biology to understand how cell behavior and the action of existing anticancer drugs are affected by the unique physiology of the cancer. This research involves investigations of chemokine pathways, and tumor-initiating cells; as well as the capacity of both synthetic and natural product-derived agents to interfere with the steps that favor metastasis. Researchers in the group identify novel pathways that may be the targets for future anticancer drugs, both derived from natural products and synthesized with the aid of colleagues through molecular design. The goal is to perform fundamental cancer-related research on botanical oils and their constituents which will carry out studies relating to the cellular safety and known cancer-related potential of components within the oils.

Intellectual Property
 
We have three potential formulations – which we have termed the “F” Platforms and two provisional patents which we have filed.
 
F1 – a unique THC + botanical extract formulation which mitigates or eliminates the negative side-effects of THC: e.g. anxiety, depression, paranoia, cognitive/memory deficits. We expect F1 to be an alternative to opioids, thus addressing addiction and dependence and effective for pain management.
 
F2 – a unique CBD + select nutraceutical/dietary additives aimed at synergizing the therapeutic properties of CBD in the treatment of anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, PTSD (chronic stress induced) and addiction.
 
F3 – expansion of research and discovery of the novel formulations utilizing other cannabinoids in addition to THC and CBD will unravel specialized applications for targeted therapies in specific mental health symptom clusters.
 
History of Algae Dynamics
 
During 2008 and 2009, we developed the BioSilo® design. In 2010, we partnered with phycology experts Dr. Muller and Dr. McConkey at the University of Waterloo. This partnership provided us with exclusive access to proprietary algae species along with phycology expertise. Through this arrangement, we operated our laboratory and advanced from bench scale algae experiments to operating a onemeter diameter BioSilo® installation. We received funding in part from Ontario Power Authority “OPA” for the design and construction of the one-meter diameter BioSilo® system. Since that time, we have updated our strategy to focus on our cannabis formulations as discussed above.
Description of Property
 
The Company initially entered into a five-year operating lease, expiring November 2018, for Unit 37-4120 Ridgeway Drive in Mississauga, Ontario, which consists of 2,224 square feet of office and production facilities. The rental for this facility has been extended for a further 3 years. The current space is adequate for the purpose of constructing an initial production/testing operation. The monthly base rental of the current facility is $1,390 plus the Company’s estimated portion of property taxes and operating expenses which are currently $847 per month. Beginning in November 2018 the base monthly rental of the current facility will be $1,853.
Regulatory Risks
 
Algae Dynamics will be subject to various US, federal, provincial, and local environmental laws and regulations including the health and safety of employees, and manufacturing practices. In addition, some of these laws and regulations require contemplated facilities to operate under permits that are subject to renewal or modification. A violation of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, natural resource damages, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns.

The Company does not intend to conduct any cannabis related business in the United States due to the uncertain regulatory environment. However, it may distribute its algae produced products (if any) to the United States nutraceutical market.
 
Product Approvals
 
Prior to commencing operations and prior to making or permitting sales of our products in a market, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the relevant country’s ministry of health or comparable agency. Where a formal approval, license or certification is not required, we nonetheless may need to seek a favorable opinion of counsel regarding our compliance with applicable laws. Prior to entering a new market in which a formal approval, license or certificate is required, we intend to work extensively with local authorities in order to obtain the requisite approvals. We expect the approval process will generally require us to present each product and product ingredient to appropriate regulators and, in some instances, arrange for testing of products by local technicians for ingredient analysis. The approvals may be conditioned on reformulation of our products, or may be unavailable with respect to some products or some ingredients. Product reformulation or the inability to introduce some products or ingredients into a particular market may have an adverse effect on sales. We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently.
 
The Company cannot determine what effect additional domestic or international governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on Company’s business in the future. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation, elimination, or relabeling of certain products to meet new standards and revisions to certain sales and marketing materials, and it is possible that the costs of complying with these new regulatory requirements could be material.
