Government Controls and Regulations
 
SPGX’s various business segments are subject to various levels of government controls and regulations, which are supplemented and revised from time to time. Currently, SPGX is in compliance with all business and operations licenses that are typically applicable to most commercial ventures. However, management is unable to predict what additional legislation or revisions may be proposed that might affect its business or when any such proposals, if enacted, might become effective. There can be no assurance that existing or new laws or regulations that may be adopted in various jurisdictions in the future, will not impose additional fees and taxes on SPGX and its business operations. Management is not aware of any such revisions to existing laws and regulations nor new laws or regulations that could have a negative impact on SPGX’s business and add additional costs to SPGX’s business operations. Such changes, however, could require increased capital and operating expenditures and could prevent or delay certain operations by SPGX.
 
The effect of these existing regulations on the business segments is that SPGX is able to carry out its current business operations as planned.
