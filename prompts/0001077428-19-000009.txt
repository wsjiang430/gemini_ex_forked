ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Background
The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by Item 1A. Risk Factors and the section captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report.
Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. (“we”, “us” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation organized in 1996, is the parent of Texas Capital Bank, National Association (the “Bank”). The Company is a registered bank holding company and a financial holding company.
The Bank is headquartered in Dallas, with primary banking offices in Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio, the five largest metropolitan areas of Texas. Substantially all of our business activities are conducted through the Bank. We have focused on organic growth, maintenance of credit quality and recruiting and retaining experienced bankers with strong personal and professional relationships in their communities.
We serve the needs of commercial businesses and successful professionals and entrepreneurs located in Texas as well as operate several lines of business serving a regional or national clientele of commercial borrowers. We are primarily a secured lender, with the majority of our loans held for investment, excluding mortgage finance loans and other national lines of business, being made to businesses headquartered or with operations in Texas. Our national lines of business provide specialized lending products to businesses throughout the United States. We have benefitted from the success of our business model since inception, producing strong loan and deposit growth and favorable loss experience amidst a challenging environment for banking nationally.
Growth History
We have grown substantially in both size and profitability since our formation. The table below sets forth data regarding the growth of key areas of our business for the past five years:

The Texas Market
The Texas market for banking services is highly competitive. Texas’ largest banking organizations are headquartered outside of Texas and are controlled by out-of-state organizations. We also compete with other providers of financial services, such as non-bank lenders, commercial finance and leasing companies, consumer finance companies, financial technology, or fintech, companies, securities firms, insurance companies, full service brokerage firms and discount brokerage firms, credit unions and savings and loan associations. We believe that many middle market companies and successful professionals and entrepreneurs are interested in banking with a company headquartered in, and with decision-making authority based in, Texas and with established Texas bankers who have the expertise to act as trusted advisors to customers with regard to their banking needs.
Our banking centers in our target markets are served by experienced bankers with lending expertise in the specific industries found in their market areas and established community ties. We believe our Bank can offer customers more responsive and personalized service than our competitors. By providing effective service to these customers, we believe we will be able to establish long-term relationships and provide multiple products to our customers, thereby enhancing our profitability.
National Lines of Business
While the Texas market continues to be central to the growth and success of our company, we have developed several lines of business, including mortgage finance, mortgage correspondent aggregation ("MCA"), homebuilder finance, insurance premium finance, lender finance and asset-based lending, that offer specialized loan and deposit products to businesses regionally and throughout the nation. We believe this helps us mitigate our geographic concentration risk in Texas. We continue to seek opportunities to develop additional lines of business that leverage our capabilities and are consistent with our business strategy.
Business Strategy
Drawing on the business and community ties of our management and their banking experience, our strategy is to continue growing an independent bank that focuses primarily on middle market business customers and successful professionals and entrepreneurs in each of the five major metropolitan markets of Texas as well as our national lines of business. To achieve this, we employ the following strategies:

• | offering a premier and differentiated banking experience to middle market businesses and successful professionals and entrepreneurs who value a broad relationship with our Bank;


• | growing our loan and deposit base in our existing markets by hiring additional experienced bankers in our different lines of business;


• | developing lines of business that leverage our strengths and complement our existing lines of business;


• | continuing our emphasis on credit policy to maintain credit quality consistent with long-term objectives;


• | leveraging our existing infrastructure with improvements in technology and processes to gain efficiencies to support a larger volume of business;


• | maintaining effective internal approval processes for capital and operating expenditures;


• | continuing our extensive use of outsourcing to provide cost-effective and more efficient operational support and service levels consistent with large-bank operations; and


• | extending our reach within our target markets and lines of business through service innovation and service excellence.

Products and Services
We offer a variety of loan, deposit account and other financial products and services to our customers.
Business Customers.    We offer a full range of products and services oriented to the needs of our business customers, including:

• | commercial loans for general corporate purposes including financing for working capital, internal growth, acquisitions and financing for business insurance premiums;


• | real estate term and construction loans;


• | mortgage warehouse lending;


• | mortgage correspondent aggregation;


• | equipment finance and leasing;


• | treasury management services, including online banking and debit and credit card services; and


• | letters of credit.

4

Individual Customers.    We also provide complete banking services for our individual customers, including:

• | personal wealth management and trust services;


• | certificates of deposit and IRAs;


• | interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing checking accounts;


• | traditional money market and savings accounts;


• | loans, both secured and unsecured; and


• | online and mobile banking.

Lending Activities
We target our lending to middle market businesses and successful professionals and entrepreneurs that meet our credit standards. The credit standards are set by our standing Credit Policy Committee with the assistance of our Bank’s Chief Credit Officer, who is charged with ensuring that credit standards are met by loans in our portfolio. Our Credit Policy Committee is comprised of senior Bank officers including our Bank’s Texas President/Chief Lending Officer, our Bank's Chief Risk Officer and our Bank’s Chief Credit Officer, and is subject to oversight by the Risk Committee of the Company's board of directors. We believe we maintain an appropriately diversified loan portfolio. Credit policies and underwriting guidelines are tailored to address the unique risks associated with each industry represented in the portfolio.
Our credit standards for commercial borrowers reference numerous criteria with respect to the borrower, including historical and projected financial information, strength of management, acceptable collateral and associated advance rates, and market conditions and trends in the borrower’s industry. In addition, prospective loans are also analyzed based on current industry concentrations in our loan portfolio to prevent an unacceptable concentration of loans in any particular industry. We believe our credit standards are consistent with achieving our business objectives in the markets we serve and are an important part of our risk mitigation. We believe that our Bank is differentiated from its competitors by its focus on and targeted marketing to our core customers and by its ability to fit its products to the individual needs of our customers.
We generally extend variable rate loans in which the interest rate fluctuates with a specified reference rate such as the United States prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and frequently provide for a minimum floor rate. Our use of variable rate loans is designed to protect us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations since the rates of interest earned will automatically reflect such fluctuations.
Deposit Products
We offer a variety of deposit products and services to our customers upon terms, including interest rates, which are competitive with other banks. Our business deposit products include commercial checking accounts, lockbox accounts, cash concentration accounts and other treasury management services, including online banking. Our treasury management online system offers information services, wire transfer initiation, ACH initiation, account transfer and service integration. Our consumer deposit products include checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We also allow our consumer deposit customers to access their accounts, transfer funds, pay bills and perform other account functions through online and mobile banking.
Wealth Management and Trust
Our wealth management and trust services include wealth strategy, financial planning, investment management, personal trust and estate services, custodial services, retirement accounts and related services. Our investment management professionals work with our clients to define objectives, goals and strategies for their investment portfolios. We assist the customer with the selection of an investment manager and work with the client to tailor the investment program accordingly. We also offer retirement products such as individual retirement accounts and administrative services for retirement vehicles such as pension and profit sharing plans. Our wealth management and trust services are primarily focused on serving the needs of our banking clients and depend on close cooperation and support between our banking relationship managers and our investment management professionals.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,641 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

Regulation and Supervision
General.    We and our Bank are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations that impose specific requirements on us and provide regulatory oversight of virtually all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations generally are intended for the protection of depositors, the deposit insurance fund ("DIF") of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the stability of the U.S. banking system as a whole, rather than for the protection of our stockholders and creditors.
The following discussion summarizes certain laws, regulations and policies to which we and our Bank are subject. It does not address all applicable laws, regulations and policies that affect us currently or might affect us in the future. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full texts of the laws, regulations and policies described.
The Company’s activities are governed by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”). We are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) pursuant to the BHCA. We file quarterly reports and other information with the Federal Reserve. We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and are subject to its regulation with respect to our securities, financial reporting and certain governance matters. Our securities are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and we are subject to Nasdaq rules for listed companies.
Our Bank is organized as a national banking association under the National Bank Act, and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”), the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) as well as being subject to regulation by certain other federal and state agencies. The OCC has primary supervisory responsibility for our Bank and performs a continuous program of examinations concerning safety and soundness, the quality of management and oversight by our board of directors, information technology and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our Bank files quarterly reports of condition and income with the FDIC, which provides insurance for certain of our Bank’s deposits.
Bank Holding Company Regulation.    The BHCA limits our business to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. We have elected to register with the Federal Reserve as a financial holding company. This authorizes us to engage in any activity that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity, as determined by the Federal Reserve, or (ii) complementary to a financial activity, so long as the activity does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of our Bank or the financial system generally, as determined by the Federal Reserve. Examples of non-banking activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments.
We are not at this time exercising the powers authorized for a financial holding company at the parent company level.
We, through our Bank, engage in traditional banking activities that are deemed financial in nature. In order for us to undertake new activities permitted by the BHCA, we and our Bank must be considered "well capitalized" (as defined below) and well managed, our Bank must have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act and we must notify the Federal Reserve within thirty days of engaging in the new activity. We do not currently expect to engage in any non-banking activities at the holding company level.
Under Federal Reserve policy, now codified by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), we are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to our Bank and commit resources to its support. Such support may be required at times when, absent this Federal Reserve policy, a holding company may not be inclined to provide it. We could in certain circumstances be required to guarantee the capital plan of our Bank if it became undercapitalized.
It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that financial holding companies may pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that financial holding companies may not pay cash dividends in an amount that would undermine the holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary.
With certain limited exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with regulations promulgated thereunder, prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be “acting in concert” from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of our company without prior notice or application to and the approval of the Federal Reserve.
If, in the opinion of the applicable federal bank regulatory authorities, a depository institution or holding company is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which could include the payment of dividends), such authority may require, generally after notice and hearing, that such institution or holding company cease and desist such practice. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital base to an inadequate level would be such an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Moreover, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have 
6

issued policy statements providing that financial holding companies and insured depository institutions generally should only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.
Regulation of Our Bank by the OCC. National banks the size of our Bank are subject to continuous regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC. The OCC regulates or monitors all areas of a national bank’s operations, including security devices and procedures, adequacy of capitalization and loss reserves, accounting treatment and impact on capital determinations, loans, investments, borrowings, deposits, liquidity, mergers, issuances of securities, payment of dividends, interest rate risk management, establishment of branches, corporate reorganizations, maintenance of books and records, and adequacy of staff training to carry on safe and sound lending and deposit gathering practices. The OCC requires national banks to maintain specified capital ratios and imposes limitations on their aggregate investment in real estate, bank premises and furniture and fixtures. National banks are required by the OCC to file quarterly reports of their financial condition and results of operations and to obtain an annual audit of their financial statements in compliance with minimum standards and procedures prescribed by the OCC.
Regulation of Our Bank by the CFPB. The CFPB has regulation, supervision and examination authority over our Bank with respect to substantially all federal statutes and regulations protecting the interests of consumers of financial services, including but not limited to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and their respective related regulations. Penalties for violating these laws and regulations could subject our Bank to lawsuits and administrative penalties, including civil monetary penalties, payments to affected consumers and orders to halt or materially change our consumer banking activities. The CFPB has broad authority to pursue enforcement actions, including investigations, civil actions and cease and desist proceedings, and can refer civil and criminal findings to the Department of Justice for prosecution. The Bank is also subject to other federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that, among other things, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive, corrupt or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition.
Capital Adequacy Requirements.    Federal banking regulators have adopted a system using risk-based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies that is based upon the 1988 capital accord of the Bank for International Settlements’ Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”), a committee of central banks and bank regulators from the major industrialized countries that coordinates international standards for bank regulation. Under the guidelines, specific categories of assets and off-balance-sheet activities such as letters of credit are assigned risk weights, based generally on the perceived credit or other risks associated with the asset. Off-balance-sheet activities are assigned a credit conversion factor based on the perceived likelihood that they will become on-balance-sheet assets. These risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a “risk weighted” asset base which is then measured against various forms of capital to produce capital ratios.
An organization’s capital is classified in one of two tiers, Core Capital, or Tier 1, and Supplementary Capital, or Tier 2. Tier 1 capital includes common stock, retained earnings, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, minority interests in the equity of consolidated subsidiaries, a limited amount of qualifying trust preferred securities and qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock at the holding company level, less goodwill and most intangible assets. Tier 2 capital includes perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities not meeting the Tier 1 definition, mandatory convertible debt securities, subordinated debt, and allowances for loan and lease losses. Each category is subject to a number of regulatory definitional and qualifying requirements.
The Basel Committee in 2010 released a set of international recommendations for strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk management of banking organizations, known as Basel III. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve published final rules for the adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework (the “Basel III Capital Rules”). The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for us on January 1, 2015, with certain transition provisions phasing in over a period that ended on January 1, 2019.
The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (i) specify a capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) require that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) define the scope of the deductions/adjustments to the capital measures. Our Series A 6.5% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock constitutes Additional Tier 1 capital and our subordinated notes constitute Tier 2 capital.
The Basel III Capital Rules set the risk-based capital requirement and the total risk-based capital requirement to a minimum of 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively, plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% producing targeted ratios of 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, which are fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019 and for subsequent years. The leverage ratio requirement under the Basel III Capital Rules is 4.0%. In order to be well capitalized under the rules now in effect, our Bank must maintain CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios that are equal to or greater than 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, and a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 5.0%. See “Selected Consolidated Financial Data - Capital and Liquidity Ratios.”
7

Additionally, the Basel III Capital Rules specify a capital conservation buffer with respect to each of the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets ratios, which provides for capital levels that exceed the minimum risk-based capital adequacy requirements. The capital conservation buffer is subject to a three year phase-in period that began on January 1, 2016 and was fully phased-in on January 1, 2019 and for subsequent years at 2.5%. The required phase-in capital conservation buffer during 2018 was 1.875%. A financial institution with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount is subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.
We have met the capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis since we commenced filing applicable reports with the FDIC and OCC. At December 31, 2018 our Bank's CET1 ratio was 8.62% and its total risk-based capital ratio was 10.77% and, as a result, it is currently classified as "well capitalized" for purposes of the OCC's prompt corrective action regulations.
Because we had less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, we are allowed to continue to classify our trust preferred securities, all of which were issued prior to May 19, 2010, as Tier 1 capital. We have elected to exclude the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in stockholders’ equity from the determination of capital ratios under the Basel III Capital Rules.
Regulators may change capital and liquidity requirements, including previous interpretations of practices related to risk weights, which could require an increase to the allocation of capital to assets held by our Bank. Regulators could also require us to make retroactive adjustments to financial statements to reflect such changes. A regulatory capital ratio or category may not constitute an accurate representation of the Bank’s overall financial condition or prospects. Our regulatory capital status is addressed in more detail under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 13 - Regulatory Restrictions in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) established a system of prompt corrective action regulations and policies to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, insured depository institutions are ranked in one of five capital categories as described below. Regulators are required to take mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions of increasing severity with respect to insured depository institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The five capital categories for insured depository institutions under the prompt corrective action regulations consist of:

• | Well capitalized - equals or exceeds a 10% total risk-based capital ratio, 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and 5% leverage ratio and is not subject to any written agreement, order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific level for any capital measure;


• | Adequately capitalized - equals or exceeds an 8% total risk-based capital ratio, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and 4% leverage ratio;


• | Undercapitalized - total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, or a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of less than 6%, or a leverage ratio of less than 4%;


• | Significantly undercapitalized - total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, or a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3%; and


• | Critically undercapitalized-a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than 2%.

The prompt corrective action regulations provide that an institution may be downgraded to the next lower category if its regulator determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing or response, that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has received and not corrected a less-than-satisfactory rating for any of the categories of asset quality, management, earnings or liquidity in its most recent examination.
Federal bank regulatory agencies are required to implement arrangements for prompt corrective action for institutions failing to meet minimum requirements to be at least adequately capitalized. FDICIA imposes an increasingly stringent array of restrictions, requirements and prohibitions as an organization’s capital levels deteriorate. A bank rated "adequately capitalized" may not accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits. A "significantly undercapitalized" institution is subject to mandated capital raising activities, restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates, removal of management and other restrictions. The OCC has only very limited discretion in dealing with a "critically undercapitalized" institution and generally must appoint a receiver or conservator (the FDIC) if the capital deficiency is not corrected promptly.
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), “critically undercapitalized” banks may not, beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt (subject to certain limited exceptions). In addition, under Section 18(i) of the FDIA, banks are required to obtain the advance consent of the FDIC to retire any part of their subordinated notes. Under the FDIA, a bank may not pay interest on its subordinated notes if such 
8

interest is required to be paid only out of net profits, or distribute any of its capital assets, while it remains in default on any assessment due to the FDIC.
Federal bank regulators may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve and OCC guidelines provide that banking organizations experiencing significant growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. Concentration of credit risks, interest rate risk (imbalances in rates, maturities or sensitivities) and risks arising from non-traditional activities, as well as an institution’s ability to manage these risks, are important factors taken into account by regulatory agencies in assessing an organization’s overall capital adequacy.
The OCC and the Federal Reserve also use a leverage ratio as an additional tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of banking organizations. The leverage ratio is a company’s Tier 1 capital divided by its average total consolidated assets. A minimum leverage ratio of 3.0% is required for banks and bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk. All other banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, unless a different minimum is specified by an appropriate regulatory authority. In order to be considered well capitalized the leverage ratio must be at least 5.0%.
Our Bank’s leverage ratio was 9.53% at December 31, 2018 and, as a result, it is currently classified as “well capitalized” for purposes of the OCC’s prompt corrective action regulations.
The risk-based and leverage capital ratios established by federal banking regulators are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet specified criteria, assuming that they otherwise have received the highest regulatory ratings in their most recent examinations. Banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions in excess of the minimum ratios. Regulators can, from time to time, change their policies or interpretations of banking practices to require changes in risk weights assigned to our Bank's assets or changes in the factors considered in order to evaluate capital adequacy, which may require our Bank to obtain additional capital to support existing asset levels or future growth or reduce asset balances in order to meet minimum acceptable capital ratios.
Liquidity Requirements.    U.S. bank regulators in September 2014 issued a final rule implementing the Basel III liquidity framework for certain U.S. banks - generally those having more than $50 billion of assets or whose primary federal banking regulator determines compliance with the liquidity framework is appropriate based on the organization's size, level of complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, U.S. or non-U.S. affiliations or risk to the financial system. One of the liquidity tests included in the new rule, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. 
The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements encourage the covered banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets, and also to increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source.
While the LCR and NSFR tests are not currently applicable to our Bank, these measures are monitored by management and, along with other relevant measures of liquidity, are reported to our board of directors. Regulators may change capital and liquidity requirements, including previous interpretations of practices related to risk weights, which could require an increase in liquid assets or in the necessary capital to support the assets held by our Bank. Regulators could also require us to make retroactive adjustments to financial statements and reported capital ratios to reflect such changes.
Stress Testing.    Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations published by the Federal Reserve and OCC, institutions with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion were required to conduct an annual “stress test” of capital and consolidated earnings and losses under a base case and two severely adverse stress scenarios provided by bank regulatory agencies. In response to this requirement we have developed dedicated staffing, economic models, policies and procedures to implement stress testing on an annual basis using scenarios released by the agencies, the results of which were published on our website, as well as conducting stress tests for internal use based upon economic scenarios we developed. On May 24, 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) was signed into law, which amended portions of the Dodd-Frank Act and immediately raised the asset threshold for stress testing from $10 billion to $100 billion for bank holding companies. On December 18, 2018, the OCC proposed regulations that would raise the stress testing threshold for national banks from $10 billion to $250 billion. As a result we, as well as the Bank, are no longer subject to stress test regulations or any requirement to publish the results of our stress testing. We will continue to perform certain stress tests internally and incorporate the economic models and information developed through our stress testing program into our risk management and business planning activities.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 ("Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act").    The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act:

• | allows bank holding companies meeting management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of non-banking activities than was permissible prior to enactment, including insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies;


• | allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks;


• | removes various restrictions that applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; and


• | establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also modifies other current financial laws, including laws related to financial privacy. The financial privacy provisions generally prohibit financial institutions, including us, from disclosing non-public personal financial information to non-affiliated third parties unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure.
Community Reinvestment Act.    The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit, making investments and providing community development services to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings. In order for a financial holding company to commence new activity permitted by the BHCA, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the CRA. Our Bank's strategic focus on serving commercial customers in regional and national markets from a limited number of branches makes it more challenging for us to satisfy CRA requirements as compared to banks of comparable size that focus on providing retail banking services in markets where they maintain a network of full-service branches.
The USA Patriot Act, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act and the Bank Secrecy Act.    A major focus of U.S. government policy regarding financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal payments. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 and the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and penalties, specifically related to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, and expanded the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. government in this area. Regulations issued under these laws impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and other suspicious activity and to verify the identity of their customers and apply additional scrutiny to customers considered to present greater than normal risk. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, reputational and financial consequences for the institution. Because of the significance of regulatory emphasis on these requirements, we have expended and expect to continue to expend significant staffing, technology and financial resources to maintain programs designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and an effective audit function for testing our compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act on an ongoing basis.
Office of Foreign Assets Control. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for administering and enforcing economic and trade sanctions against specified foreign parties, including countries and regimes, foreign individuals and other foreign organizations and entities. OFAC publishes lists of prohibited parties that are regularly consulted by our Bank in the conduct of its business in order to assure compliance. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, prohibited parties identified by OFAC, avoiding unlicensed trade and financial transactions with such parties and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with OFAC requirements could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for our Bank.
Safe and Sound Banking Practices; Enforcement.    Banks and bank holding companies are prohibited from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices. Bank regulators have broad authority to prohibit and penalize activities of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws, regulations or written directives of or agreements with regulators. Regulators have considerable discretion in identifying what they deem to be unsafe and unsound practices and in pursuing enforcement actions in response to them.
The FDIA requires federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions that relate to, among other things: (i) internal controls, information systems and audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate exposure; (v) asset growth and quality; and (vi) compensation and benefits. Federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these requirements, which regulators use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any 
10

standards prescribed by the guidelines, the bank may be required to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, and agree to specific deadlines for the submission to and review by the regulator of reports confirming progress in implementing the safety and soundness compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan may result in an enforcement action against the bank.
Enforcement actions against us, our Bank and our officers and directors may include the issuance of a written directive, the issuance of a cease-and-desist order that can be judicially enforced, the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, the issuance of formal and informal agreements, the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers or other institution-affiliated parties, the imposition of restrictions and sanctions under prompt corrective action regulations, the termination of deposit insurance (in the case of our Bank) and the appointment of a conservator or receiver for our Bank. Civil money penalties can be as high as $1.0 million for each day a violation continues.
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders.    Our Bank is subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act which places limits on, among other covered transactions, the amount of loans or extensions of credit to affiliates that may be made by our Bank. Extensions of credit to affiliates must be adequately collateralized by specified amounts and types of collateral. Section 23A also limits the amount of loans or advances by our Bank to third party borrowers which are collateralized by our securities or obligations or those of our subsidiaries. Our Bank also is subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, prohibits an institution from engaging in transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliates.
We are subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their related interests. These restrictions are contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation O and apply to all insured institutions as well as their subsidiaries and holding companies. These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such loans can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests, which cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus, unless the FDIC determines that a lesser amount is appropriate. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions. Additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders are discussed in the Dodd-Frank Act section below.
Restrictions on Dividends and Repurchases.    The sole source of funding of our parent company financial obligations has consisted of proceeds of capital markets transactions and cash payments from our Bank for debt service and dividend payments with respect to our Bank's preferred stock issued to the Company. We may in the future seek to rely upon receipt of dividends paid by our Bank to meet our financial obligations. Our Bank is subject to statutory dividend restrictions. Under such restrictions, national banks may not, without the prior approval of the OCC, declare dividends in excess of the sum of the current year’s net profits plus the retained net profits from the prior two years, less any required transfers to surplus. The Basel III Capital Rules further limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by our Bank. In addition, under the FDICIA, our Bank may not pay any dividend if it is undercapitalized or if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized.
Limits on Compensation.    The Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC in 2010 issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies for executive management of banks and bank holding companies. This guidance was intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine their safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The objective of the guidance is to assure that incentive compensation arrangements (i) provide incentives that do not encourage excessive risk-taking, (ii) are compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (iii) are supported by strong corporate governance, including oversight by the board of directors. In 2016, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC proposed rules that would, depending upon the assets of the institution, directly regulate incentive compensation arrangements and would require enhanced oversight and recordkeeping. As of December 31, 2018, these rules have not been implemented.
The Dodd-Frank Act.    The Dodd-Frank Act became law in 2010 and has had a broad impact on the financial services industry, imposing significant regulatory and compliance changes. A significant volume of financial services regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Act have not yet been finalized by banking regulators, Congress continues to consider legislation that would make significant changes to the law and courts are addressing significant litigation arising under the Act, making it difficult to predict the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business. The following discussion provides a brief summary of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may have an effect on us.
The Dodd-Frank Act significantly reduces the ability of national banks to rely upon federal preemption of state consumer financial laws and permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. Although the OCC, as the primary regulator of national banks, has the ability to make preemption determinations where certain conditions are met, the broad rollback of federal preemption has the potential to create a patchwork of federal and state compliance obligations and enforcement. This may result in significant state regulatory requirements applicable to us and certain of our lending activities, with potentially significant changes in our operations and increases in our compliance costs.

The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the general $250,000 insurance limit for insured deposits. Amendments to the FDIA also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF are calculated. The assessment base now consists of average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity capital and an amount the FDIC determines is necessary to establish assessments consistent with the risk-based assessment system found in the FDIA, which assigns insured institutions to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. As of July 1, 2017, minimum and maximum assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) for institutions the size of our Bank range from 3 to 30 basis points of average consolidated total assets less average tangible capital. These changes contributed to an increase in the FDIC deposit insurance premiums we paid in 2017 and 2018. In November 2018, the FDIC announced that the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve reached 1.36%, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35% ahead of the September 30, 2020 deadline required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Upon reaching the minimum, surcharges on us and other insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more ceased.
The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. Insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of restrictions on loans to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivatives transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution’s board of directors.
The Dodd-Frank Act increases the risk of “secondary actor liability” for lenders that provide financing or other services to customers offering financial products or services to consumers, as our Bank does in our mortgage finance, mortgage correspondent aggregation and lender finance lines of business. The Dodd-Frank Act can impose liability on a service provider for knowingly or recklessly providing substantial assistance to a customer found to have engaged in unfair, deceptive or abusive practices that injure a consumer. This exposure contributes to increased compliance and other costs in connection with the administration of credit extended to entities engaged in providing financial products and services to consumers.
The Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent compliance, capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These developments may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make changes to our business as necessary to comply with new and changing statutory and regulatory requirements.
The Volcker Rule.    The Dodd-Frank Act amended the BHCA to require the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading in designated types of financial instruments and from investing in and sponsoring certain hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule has not had a material effect on our operations since we do not engage in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule. Unanticipated effects of the Volcker Rule’s provisions or future interpretations may have an adverse effect on our business or services provided to our Bank by other financial institutions.
