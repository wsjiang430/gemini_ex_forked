Overview
 We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule protease inhibitors for diseases with significant unmet need. Our first product candidates are inhibitors of plasma kallikrein being developed for two indications: hereditary angioedema (“HAE”) and diabetic macular edema (“DME”). We apply our insights into the chemistry of proteases and, with our current programs, the biology of the plasma kallikrein system, to develop small molecule inhibitors with high selectivity, potency and bioavailability that we believe will make them successful treatments for disease. We have created a structurally diverse portfolio of oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors and advanced multiple drug candidates into Phase 1 clinical trials in order to create what we believe will be best-in-class oral therapies for these two indications. 
 We have advanced one of these candidates, KVD900, into later stage clinical development as potential on-demand therapy for HAE attacks, with a Phase 2 clinical trial expected to complete in late 2019. This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of KVD900 as an on-demand treatment for HAE attacks in at least 50 Type 1 and Type 2 HAE patients. In the case of DME, we are initially developing a plasma kallikrein inhibitor which is administered directly into the eye and anticipate ultimately developing orally delivered drugs. Our most advanced DME drug candidate, KVD001, is currently in a fully enrolled Phase 2 clinical trial which we anticipate will be completed in the second half of 2019.

HAE is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition with symptoms that include episodes of debilitating and often painful swelling in the skin, gastrointestinal tract or airways. Despite having multiple therapies approved, we believe HAE patients are in need of alternatives that better meet their objectives for quality of life and ease of disease control. Currently marketed therapies are all administered by injection and we anticipate that there will be strong interest in safe and effective, orally delivered, small molecule treatments. Our strategy for the treatment of HAE is to develop a portfolio of molecules, both to provide best-in-class oral therapeutics as well as to have the opportunity to evaluate molecules for different market segments. Our medicinal chemistry program has discovered and patented a large portfolio of structurally diverse plasma kallikrein inhibitors, which enables us to select only compounds that meet stringent criteria for progression. 
 
Based upon results observed in the Phase 1 trial, we have selected the compound KVD900 to move forward as a potential therapy for on-demand treatment of acute attacks in patients with HAE. We believe that a conveniently administered oral, on-demand product could provide an opportunity to capture a significant portion of the current acute treatment market as well as patients who may currently use prophylactic therapies because of the lack of convenient and effective alternatives. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial for KVD900 in late 2018 that we expect to complete in late 2019. This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of KVD900 as an on-demand treatment for HAE attacks when taken at the onset of symptoms.
 
Our Phase 1 first-in-human study of KVD900 displayed what we believe is a very attractive profile for on-demand therapy. In the placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers, doses of up to 600 mg were generally well tolerated with no dose-limiting safety signals emerging and no treatment-related gastrointestinal adverse events noted at all dose levels tested. The pharmacokinetic exposure profile revealed rapid absorption of KVD900 following oral administration to maximal concentrations more than 100x the concentration at which we believe we can demonstrate clinical efficacy. The rapidity of absorption was such that at the higher dose levels, effective concentrations were reached in as little as 10 minutes after dosing. Exposure to KVD900, determined as both maximal concentration and overall exposure (area under the curve) increased dose-dependently. We believe this combination of rapid uptake and very high drug levels compares favorably to the existing injected therapies, which show no faster absorption and generally much lower peak levels of drug concentration. Our pharmacodynamic analysis of samples collected from the volunteers following administration of KVD900 shows high levels of plasma kallikrein inhibition for as long as 10 hours after a single dose. This data, combined with the level of inhibition of plasma kallikrein activity by exogenously added KVD900 in HAE patient plasma tested in a separate assay, leads us to believe that a single dose of KVD900 may inhibit plasma kallikrein in patients experiencing an acute HAE attack sufficiently to provide a therapeutic alternative that is superior to current treatments.
 
DME is the leading cause of moderate vision loss in most developed countries and diabetes, the underlying cause of DME, is the leading cause of blindness among adults aged 20 to 74 years old, according to 2014 statistics published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Our DME program is initially focused on the development of an intravitreally administered small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitor, KVD001. We believe intravitreal plasma kallikrein inhibitors may be an effective alternative therapy to vascular endothelial growth factor (“VEGF”) inhibitors and further improve visual acuity and decrease macular thickening. Preclinical pharmacokinetic studies in animals using KVD001 have shown that direct injection into the eye delivers a high drug concentration at the desired site of action. The drug concentration is maintained for a prolonged period with a low systemic exposure, potentially supporting an extended dosing schedule. We have successfully completed a first-in-human trial of KVD001 in patients with DME and have fully enrolled a Phase 2 trial that we expect to complete in the second half of 2019. In addition to KVD001, we also plan to develop an oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor to treat DME. An oral treatment may provide the opportunity to reduce treatment burden, treat patients earlier in disease progression, and provide a convenient and readily accessible treatment option for DME.
 
In addition to KVD900 for HAE and KVD001 for DME, in January 2019 we announced initiation of a first-in-human study for KVD824, our next clinical stage oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor candidate. This study tested single doses of KVD824 from 10 mg to 1280 mg and multiple doses from 80mg to 640mg given twice daily.  KVD824 was generally well tolerated at all dose levels tested. Based upon these results, we believe that KVD824 may have potential for development in either HAE or DME, and we have determined to conduct additional formulation work to further optimize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the compound prior to making a decision as to which indication to pursue. We anticipate completing this additional work in 2019, and are currently making preparations to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in our chosen indication in the first half of 2020.

In October 2017, our wholly-owned, U.K. based subsidiary KalVista Pharmaceuticals Limited (“KalVista Limited) and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (“Merck”) entered into an option agreement (the “Option Agreement”) under which we granted to Merck an option to acquire KVD001 through a period following completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial. We also granted to Merck a similar option to acquire investigational orally delivered molecules for DME (the “Oral DME Compounds”) that we will continue to develop as part of our ongoing research and development activities, through a period following the completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial. Under the terms of the Option Agreement, Merck paid to us a non-refundable upfront fee of $37.0 million in November 2017 and may pay up to an additional $715 million in milestones as well as royalties on net sales of any products commercialized under the Agreement. The next payment due from Merck will be in the event that Merck determines to exercise its option on KVD001 after we provide them with a data package following the Phase 2 trial completion. Should Merck exercise this option, they will be obligated to make an exercise payment as well as additional milestone payments based upon achievement of further clinical and regulatory events. Merck also invested approximately $9.1 million in a separate private placement transaction of common shares that closed concurrently with the Option Agreement.
 Strategy
 Key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Apply our deep scientific expertise in the area of serine proteases to develop novel oral therapies for indications with high unmet need. Our core scientific team has decades of experience working on protease inhibitors and developing compounds with high potency, selectivity and bioavailability. We have assembled a team of chemists and biologists who have demonstrated the ability to design and formulate multiple drug candidate programs from a broad variety of chemical classes, as indicated by our extensive intellectual property portfolio. Our initial focus is specifically on development of plasma kallikrein inhibitors for HAE and DME; however, we believe our scientific capabilities also can be applied to other proteases to develop therapies for diseases with high unmet need and orphan indications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance multiple HAE product candidates into clinical development. We intend to develop best-in-class oral therapies for HAE and, to accomplish that goal, we plan to bring multiple drug candidates into clinical trials and compare their performance before determining which program, or programs, to advance. KVD900 has been chosen to advance to later stage development as an on-demand therapy for acute HAE attacks, and a Phase 2 clinical trial in HAE patients is expected to complete in late 2019. We are still conducting preclinical development of multiple additional drug candidates. We expect that these additional candidates will be developed for other portions of the HAE market, such as prophylactic treatment, that are still in need of better therapeutic options.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to advance our intravitreal DME program and develop an oral therapy. KVD001, our first product candidate to treat DME, will complete a Phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2019. We also intend to develop an oral therapy for this indication, which we believe could dramatically improve the standard of care for patients, since all current therapies are delivered by injection into the eye.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow our capabilities internally as well as through strategic partnerships. We intend to retain ownership and control of our pipeline programs to key milestones. For certain indications, such as HAE, that can be addressed by a focused organization, we may determine to keep all program rights and develop sales and marketing capabilities. For programs that address larger markets or require greater infrastructure or resources, we may seek a partner that can provide those capabilities such as we did with Merck in DME. Decisions on whether, and when, to engage in partnerships or collaborations will be based upon our evaluations of the relative risks and rewards of those collaborations at each point in the development cycle.

 Plasma Kallikrein in HAE and DME 
 Plasma kallikrein is a serine protease enzyme that is a key early mediator of inflammation and edema. The body modulates the inflammatory effects of plasma kallikrein through a circulating inhibitor protein called C1-esterase inhibitor (“C1-INH”). Most patients with HAE have genetic mutations that lead to C1-INH deficiency, 
 3

which results in an inability to control activated plasma kallikrein in affected tissues. This excessive activation leads to inflammation, edema, and pain. 
 Published laboratory work has shown that the vitreous fluid of the eye is also a site of increased plasma kallikrein in DME. In diabetic patients, the retina is one of a few tissues in which edema develops. Under normal circumstances the eye is protected from the diffusion of plasma proteins by an effective blood vessel barrier. In diabetes this barrier becomes less effective and allows plasma proteins such as plasma kallikrein to enter the retina and vitreous. While C1-INH can also to enter by the same route, animal models of DME have shown that the concentration of C1-INH in the vitreous fluid is insufficient to fully suppress the effects of plasma kallikrein on retinal edema. Over time, this edema leads to retinal damage that causes blindness.
 Hereditary Angioedema 
 Disease Overview
 HAE is a rare and potentially life-threatening genetic condition that occurs in about 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 people, according to published information from an HAE patient advocacy group. Excessive plasma kallikrein activation that is not sufficiently controlled by C1-INH leads to HAE attacks, which can vary with regard to the affected tissue or organ and severity. HAE attacks include episodes of intense swelling usually in the skin, gastrointestinal tract or airways. They often lead to temporary disfiguration of various body parts including the hands, feet, face, body trunk, and genitals. In addition, patients often have bouts of excruciating abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting that is caused by swelling in the intestinal wall. Airway swelling is particularly dangerous and can lead to death by asphyxiation.
 Attacks can occur spontaneously although they often are associated with anxiety, stress, minor trauma, surgery, or illnesses. Commonly patients are alerted to an impending attack by prodromal symptoms which include rash, fatigue, and muscle aches. Trauma to the oral cavity caused by dental procedures makes HAE patients particularly vulnerable to airway attacks. The frequency of HAE attacks is highly variable, with some patients having attacks several times per week and others very infrequently. Population studies have shown that the median number of attacks per month for patients is approximately one, and approximately 90% of patients have two or fewer attacks per month. Although life-threatening airway swelling is rare, at least half of HAE patients have experienced at least one such attack and airway attacks remain a major cause of mortality in HAE patients. The severity of attacks is unpredictable and not related to their underlying frequency. A patient with only one attack per year can nevertheless be at risk of suffering a laryngeal attack. 
 
The most common cause of HAE is a defect or mutation in the gene responsible for the production of C1-INH. HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, meaning that a defect in only one copy of the gene leads to symptoms and that it occurs at similar rates in both males and females. While HAE can result from the inheritance of a defective gene from a parent, a number of cases also arise from spontaneous mutations. Patients with C1-INH-related disease are classified as Type 1 or Type 2; Type 1 is the most common form and results in low levels of circulating C1-INH and Type 2 results in production of a low function protein. An additional form of HAE, sometimes called normal C1-INH HAE, can occur in patients with normal levels of C1-INH for a variety of reasons including mutations in genes for Factor 12, plasminogen or angiopoetin. Moreover, bradykinin-induced acute attacks of angioedema can occur idiopathically in individuals for which a hereditary cause has not yet been identified. Excessive formation of bradykinin can also be caused by increased circulation of estrogens, reduced elimination of bradykinin, or through use of drugs such as ACE inhibitors. 
 C1-INH is a natural plasma-borne protein that is an inhibitor of multiple serine proteases in both the complement and kallikrein kinin systems. C1-INH is the predominant physiological inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, and thereby suppresses the generation of bradykinin, a potent hormone produced by plasma kallikrein, that activates its receptors on blood vessels to increase vascular leakage. Uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity leads to the edema that is the hallmark of HAE. Selective plasma kallikrein inhibitors and a bradykinin receptor antagonist are approved therapies for HAE. As such, plasma kallikrein is a clinically validated target for HAE and previous studies have demonstrated that plasma kallikrein inhibition can both treat and prevent HAE attacks.

Current Treatments and Market opportunities
 There are a number of marketed and development stage therapeutics for HAE which provide evidence that inhibition of plasma kallikrein activity will give therapeutic benefit in HAE. Lanadelumab (TakyzyroTM) is a plasma kallikrein inhibitor indicated for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of HAE. The prescribing information recommends subcutaneous administration every two weeks. Dosing every four weeks may be considered in some patients. Ecallantide (Kalbitor®) is a small protein inhibitor of plasma kallikrein that is approved for treatment of acute attacks of HAE. While effective, ecallantide has been associated with cases of anaphylaxis and its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) includes a black box warning limiting its administration to healthcare professionals. Other therapies provide C1-INH replacement to control plasma kallikrein levels. Marketed C1-INH replacement therapies include Cinryze® and Berinert®, which are purified from human plasma, and Ruconest® which is a recombinant product. Icatibant (Firazyr®) is a synthetic peptide-based antagonist that blocks the activity of bradykinin. All of these products are administered by injection, which is typically less convenient for patients and has the potential to reduce compliance. As a result of the lifelong nature of HAE and the challenges related to taking many of the injected therapies, patient surveys consistently indicate an overwhelming desire of patients for an oral therapy. We believe that a safe and effective oral agent has the potential to transform treatment for this disease. We also believe that opportunities exist for both acute and prophylactic treatments, and we intend to consider all of our programs as potential therapies in both segments of the market. For this reason, we plan to evaluate multiple formulations and profiles of our programs as part of our clinical development strategy.
 We believe a further future market opportunity may exist in treatment of normal C1-INH HAE. Estimates of the size of this patient population vary widely, but we believe that the nature of normal C1-INH HAE disease may make prophylaxis less attractive for these patients than a safe and rapidly effective on-demand plasma kallikrein inhibitor therapy.
 Our Portfolio of HAE Programs
 Our strategy is to evaluate and develop multiple oral molecules in pursuit of best-in-class therapies for HAE patients, with an initial focus on treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 HAE. This portfolio approach may lead to development of multiple molecules to address unmet need in both prophylactic and acute market segments. We have promoted multiple molecules into clinical testing and are pursuing additional candidates in order to expand the universe of properties and increase the likelihood of delivery of one or more best-in-class treatments for HAE. The first of these product candidates to be evaluated in later stage clinical trials is KVD900. KVD900 entered a Phase 2 clinical trial in late 2018 that is expected to complete in late 2019.
 KVD900
 The Phase 1, first-in-human study of KVD900 was a multi-part study consisting of a single ascending dose phase, a formulation cross-over phase, and investigation of food effect in 84 healthy, male volunteers. Doses up to 600 mg were tested in this study using both capsule and tablet formulation, with the tablet the intended formulation for future development. Data from the single ascending dose phase of the study showed that KVD900 tablets were rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and achieved blood levels that we believe are sufficient for efficacy within as little as 10 minutes at the higher dose levels, and essentially complete inhibition of plasma kallikrein was observed within 30 minutes. During the formulation cross-over eight subjects were administered 100 mg KVD900 in both capsule and tablet formulation with a 7 day washout period between dosings. In the food effect phase twelve subjects were dosed fasted or following a standardized high calorie and high fat meal. The fed state had little impact on the pharmacodynamic profile of KVD900 tablets, delivering 95% inhibition within 30 minutes.
 5

There were no severe adverse events (“SAE”) reported. On active treatment, 22 of the 23 reported adverse events (AE) were mild; a moderate AE of headache was reported in the 10 mg dose group and considered unrelated to treatment. There was one gastrointestinal AE reported during the study which was considered unrelated to treatment. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECG or safety laboratory findings. Single doses of KVD900 up to 600 mg were generally well-tolerated in this study.
 Evidence from studies using therapies approved for the treatment of acute HAE attacks shows that earlier treatment has a powerful impact on the efficacy outcomes. Despite clear evidence that early treatment markedly reduces attack duration, treatment is often delayed. In one outcome study of 207 HAE attacks, attack duration was 2.75-fold shorter when treatment was administered within 1 hour of attack onset (6.1 hours versus 16.8 hours [p<0.001]), yet nearly 60% of patients delayed treatment for more than one hour after the attack began, and 30% waited more than five hours. We believe this delay in administration is due to many factors including the inconvenience of preparation and administration as well as the discomfort of injectable therapies. An oral therapy has the potential to overcome these and lower the barrier for treatment for patients. The combination of the rapid uptake of KVD900 to very high blood levels and the likelihood of earlier dosing by patients, could lead to much better disease management and prevention of attacks reaching the critical stage of significant swelling and discomfort. We therefore believe that a safe, oral on-demand treatment has the potential to become a preferred alternative for patients currently using injectable treatments, including both acute and prophylactic therapies. 
 Based upon the results of the Phase 1 study, we are currently dosing KVD900 in a Phase 2 clinical trial intended to evaluate KVD900 as an on-demand treatment for HAE attacks. We intend to investigate the efficacy of KVD900 in at least 50 Type 1 and Type 2 HAE patients, conducted at 10-15 sites in the UK, Germany and several other European countries. During the first part of this two-part study, patients will receive a single 600 mg dose of KVD900 while not having an attack to explore pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. All patients will then enter part two of the study, which is a randomized, blinded, crossover investigation of the efficacy of KVD900 versus placebo. Each patient will treat two attacks with trial medication, one with KVD900 and one with placebo in a randomized, blinded sequence. Following randomization, patients will be given the first treatment of the sequence to take home. At the onset of an attack patients will call their doctor to confirm the attack has started and will take their treatment within one hour of the recorded onset. Patients will then return to the clinic to receive the alternative treatment and proceed to treat a second attack in an identical manner.  Patients will have access to their normal, acute treatment as required. The primary endpoint is use of standard of care and the secondary endpoints are comprised of several different symptom severity scores. Data is expected from this trial in late 2019.
 Additional HAE Development Plans
 In parallel with progression of KVD900 for on-demand therapy, we are committed to expansion of our proprietary compound portfolio to enable development of molecules with a diverse set of properties that maximize our chance of progressing additional best-in-class treatments for HAE. We intend to develop one of our other drug candidates to provide a therapeutic option for the prophylactic segment of the market. Our scientific team has 
 6

demonstrated the ability to consistently generate new candidate molecules, enabling a rigorous selection process that only advances programs that meet strict internal criteria. As part of this effort, we have developed assays that provide proprietary insights into inhibition of plasma kallikrein, supporting selection of product candidates at an earlier stage that may have a higher likelihood of demonstrating clinical success. Activation of plasma kallikrein during an HAE attack results in the cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen (HK) to release bradykinin, which increases vascular permeability leading to angioedema. Previous studies have shown that protection of HK from cleavage is associated with protection from HAE attacks. Therefore, we use an assay to quantify the protection of HK whole plasma as an ex vivo model to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of plasma kallikrein inhibitors on HAE attacks. This model evaluates the effects of plasma kallikrein inhibitors on the specific plasma kallikrein substrate (HK) that is associated with bradykinin generation in undiluted plasma, which has physiologically relevant concentrations of components of the kallikrein system as well as factors that may influence the activity of inhibitors. Indeed, we have found that some compounds that work well on pure enzyme may perform poorly in whole plasma. Therefore, we have specifically selected and optimized plasma kallikrein inhibitors for potency in plasma. 
Diabetic Macular Edema 
 Disease Overview 
 DME occurs as a complication of diabetes and is caused by the breakdown of the endothelial barrier function in the retina, resulting in the accumulation of fluid in the macula. This leads to edematous thickening of the macula region of the retina and loss of visual acuity, potentially leading to blindness. DME is a major complication associated with diabetes, affecting an estimated 26% of type 1 diabetic patients after 14 years of the disease, and an estimated 29% over their lifetime; 17% of type 1 diabetic patients were estimated to develop clinically significant macular edema over their lifetime. Approximately 900,000 patients in the United States have active DME and are at serious risk of vision loss, according to a study published in 2015.
 The current standard of care for DME in the United States is therapy directed against VEGF, a hypoxia-induced protein that stimulates the growth of blood vessels in the retina. FDA approved anti-VEGF therapies for DME are ranibizumab (Lucentis®) and aflibercept (Eylea®). Both of these products are administered via intravitreal injection at roughly monthly intervals. In addition to treatment by these two products, a large fraction of patients is treated with bevacizumab (Avastin®), another therapy that works through the same mechanism of binding to VEGF but has not been approved for ophthalmic use. Bevacizumab is priced based on its application in oncology and off-label use by retinal specialists typically results in treatment at a fraction of the cost seen with both ranibizumab and aflibercept. Patients are also treated with laser therapy in some circumstances.
 A number of other drug therapies are used to treat DME, including corticosteroid anti-inflammatories such as triamcinolone acetonide, fluocinolone, and dexamethasone. These drugs also are administered via intravitreal injection. Sustained release versions of fluocinolone (Illuvien®) and dexamethasone (Ozurdex®) have been approved for use in DME, substantially reducing the number of injections required to obtain and maintain clinical responses. These novel corticosteroid formulations led to 15-letter improvements in visual acuity in approximately 20-30% of patients. Corticosteroid treatment, however, is associated with a dramatic increase in cataract formation and a rise in intraocular pressure, reducing the attractiveness of these agents as potential therapies in many patients. 
 In a recent large, multi-center clinical trial in DME patients, anti-VEGF therapy led to approximately 20% of patients improving their visual acuity by 15 letters or more after a median of 9 or 10 intravitreal injections, leaving a significant portion of the patients with inadequate control of their disease. Further, in one study conducted for an approved anti-VEGF, 40% of patients displayed minimal improvement in visual acuity following anti-VEGF therapy after months of treatment. 
 Research into the biology underlying DME by our scientific team has identified plasma kallikrein as a potential novel target for this indication. KalVista scientists were the first to identify increased concentrations of plasma kallikrein in vitreous fluid samples obtained from individuals with diabetic retinopathy and DME and have pioneered the development of plasma kallikrein inhibitors for the treatment of this disease. Our group has established preclinical models to investigate the role of plasma kallikrein in both VEGF-independent and VEGF-mediated DME as well as for underlying pathologies associated with diabetic retinopathy. We have used this in-depth knowledge of the plasma kallikrein system, diabetic retinopathy, and clinical ophthalmology to evaluate the effects of orally available plasma kallikrein inhibitors for the treatment of DME. Using a pharmacology platform, 
 7

originally developed and validated using plasma kallikrein knockout mice at the Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School, we have screened and characterized the pharmacodynamic effects of KalVista’s oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors. We were the first to demonstrate that plasma kallikrein inhibition and gene knockout are protective against VEGF-induced retinal edema.
 Using subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps we have quantified the dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effect of plasma kallikrein inhibitors on VEGF-induced retinal edema and have correlated these effects with both plasma and retinal drug concentrations. Moreover, using gavage we have characterized the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics effects of orally administered plasma kallikrein inhibitors on retinal edema. These models and protocols have enabled detailed characterization and comparison of the effects of multiple oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors on retinal edema. 
 Our DME Development Activities
 Our first potential DME therapy is KVD001. KVD001 is a potent inhibitor of human plasma kallikrein with an IC50 of approximately 10 nM and a high degree of selectivity against a broad range of other proteases. We have developed KVD001 for intravitreal injection because we believe that trials using this delivery modality will provide a relatively early and direct proof-of-concept since the molecule is delivered directly to the site of edema. Since other products such as anti-VEGF therapies are also delivered intravitreally, we believe this will be accepted by both physicians and patients and will not lead to any competitive disadvantages. Another inherent advantage of intravitreal administration is that there is very limited systemic exposure, thus reducing potential systemic safety concerns.
 We have completed an open label single ascending dose Phase 1 trial of KVD001 in 14 DME patients, all of whom had previously received anti-VEGF treatment but had discontinued this treatment prior to entry into the study. Following this study, we conducted further preclinical testing to enable multiple monthly injections of KVD001, as well as enable concurrent treatment with KVD001 and anti-VEGF therapy. In 2018 we began recruiting a Phase 2 trial of KVD001 administered by intravitreal injection in DME patients that is now fully enrolled. This study is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KVD001 in patients with DME who have received previous anti-VEGF therapy but continue to demonstrate reduced visual acuity and significant edema. All patients will have discontinued anti-VEGF therapy prior to entry into the study. The double-masked study consists of two active arms receiving low or high dose injections, and a sham control arm. Patients receive a total of four injections over a three-month period, with evaluation at the end of the dosing period and for three months following. The endpoints include safety and tolerability, best corrected visual acuity, central subfield thickness, and the diabetic retinopathy severity scale. We continue to anticipate that data from this study will be available in the second half of 2019. 
 KVD001 is subject to the Option Agreement with Merck. Under the terms of that Agreement once we provide certain data including results from the study, Merck will have a defined period to exercise the option on KVD001, as well as to make an additional payment to maintain the option on the Oral DME Compounds.
 Potential for Oral DME Therapies 
 In parallel with the clinical development of our intravitreal product candidate KVD001, we intend to identify and advance plasma kallikrein inhibitors as oral therapies for DME. We believe that a safe and effective oral therapy has the potential to transform the treatment of DME which to date has been dominated by drug therapies that must be injected intravitreally. Future trials in DME with oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors may focus on the treatment of earlier stage disease, a stage at which intravitreal injections are not a desirable solution due to their inherently invasive nature and consequent risk of adverse reactions.
 
Additional Earlier Stage Programs
 In January 2019, we announced the initiation of a first-in-human study for our next clinical stage oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor, KVD824. This ongoing study includes single ascending dose, multiple ascending dose, and food effect cohorts, and tests the drug at dose levels ranging from 10 mg to 1280 mg. The single ascending dose part of the study demonstrated dose-dependent increases in exposure, achieving mean Cmax concentrations of over 9,000 
 8

ng/ml at the highest dose studied. The multiple ascending dose part of the study was conducted at doses from 80 mg up to 640 mg twice per day for 5 days. Exposures were consistent between days 1 and 5 at all dose levels. Examination of the blinded safety data across all cohorts, both single and multiple dose, revealed no significant changes in vital signs, ECG or safety laboratory results, there were no dose-limiting tolerability or safety signals reported and all subjects completed the study. 
 The blood levels achieved in this study, along with other preclinical data we have generated, suggests to us that KVD824 may have potential for development in either HAE or DME. We further believe that there may be an opportunity to formulate KVD824 in such manner as to modify the release characteristics to further optimize its potential in either of these indications. We have initiated that formulation development work, which we anticipate can be completed in 2019. Based upon the results of those efforts, as well as other strategic considerations, additional ongoing preclinical development of other compounds and the results of our ongoing trials in both HAE and DME, we expect to make a final determination of the indication in which to develop KVD824 in early 2020. We are currently planning for a Phase 2 clinical trial for KVD824 that we would seek to initiate in our selected indication in the first half of 2020.
 The pharmacology of KVD824 has been studied in pharmacodynamic models of both HAE and DME. For HAE, our pharmacology studies show that KVD824 added exogenously to whole human plasma provides dose dependent protection against HK cleavage following ex vivo stimulation with dextran sulfate.  The IC50 of KVD824 for dextran sulfate stimulated HK cleavage is approximately 100 nM.


For DME, preclinical studies with KVD824 were performed on mice with retinal edema induced by intravitreal injection of VEGF as an experimental model of DME. Retinal edema was quantified as the increase in retinal thickness at 24 hrs post injection with VEGF compared with baseline and measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Oral administration of KVD824 by gavage decreased VEGF-induced retinal edema by 84.6 % compared with mice receiving vehicle (data shown below). A comparable decrease in VEGF-induced edema were demonstrated in mice continuously administered with KVD824 using subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps. The effects of KVD824 in reducing retinal edema is comparable with the effect of complete plasma prekallikrein gene knockout in reducing VEGF-induced retinal thickening. We have identified the plasma concentrations of KVD824 that are associated with the inhibition of retinal edema in this murine model. Comparison of these data with the pharmacokinetic data from the first in human study with KVD824 indicates that the plasma concentrations KVD824 that associated with a reduction in retinal edema in our preclinical model are achieved by orally administered KVD824 in our MAD study described above.

In addition to our clinical stage candidates, we are continually conducting preclinical development work on multiple additional drug candidates in order to achieve our goal of creating best-in-class oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors for prophylactic HAE therapy, as well as for the treatment of DME. We currently have multiple additional compounds in preclinical testing. We routinely terminate earlier stage programs for any number of reasons that lead us to believe they will not achieve our objectives, and our medicinal chemistry team is constantly developing new potential candidates. We believe this capacity to develop large numbers of candidate compounds is key to success in drug development and represents a core strategic asset of the Company.
 Competition
 In treating HAE, we expect to face competition from several FDA-approved therapeutics, including TakhzyroTM and Cinryze, marketed by Takeda in the United States and Europe for the prevention of angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents; Firazyr, marketed by Takeda in the United States, Europe and certain other geographic territories for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult patients; Kalbitor, an injectable plasma kallikrein inhibitor marketed by Takeda for the resolution of acute attacks in adolescent and adult HAE patients; Berinert and Haegarda, marketed by CSL Behring for the prophylaxis and treatment of acute abdominal, facial or laryngeal attacks of HAE in adults and adolescents; and Ruconest, marketed by Pharming Group for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult patients. We are also aware of two companies that are engaged in the clinical development of oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors for use as prophylaxis in HAE patients, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals and Attune Pharmaceuticals. BioCryst is also conducting clinical trials of a liquid, orally delivered formulation of BCX7353 for use as on-demand therapy in acute attacks.
 In treating DME, we expect to face competition from several FDA-approved therapeutics, including anti-VEGF therapies Lucentis, marketed by Roche and Novartis, Eylea, marketed by Regeneron, and off-label use of Avastin from Roche. We also face competition from various corticoid steroids including extended release formulations lluvien, marketed by Alimera, and Ozurdex, marketed by Allergan. We further expect to compete with generic corticosteroids such as fluocinolone acetonide, and dexamethasone and we are aware of a number of other companies that have product candidates in early clinical trials, including Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Boehringer Ingelheim, Roche, Regeneron, Ohr Pharmaceutical, Aerpio Therapeutics, Oxurion and Allegro Ophthalmics. Oxurion recently announced data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of an intravitreally delivered plasma kallikrein inhibitor for the treatment of DME and indicated plans to continue development.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success substantially depends on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of intellectual property rights for our product candidates, methods used to manufacture our product candidates and methods for treating patients using our product candidates, as well as our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of 
 10

others. As of April 30, 2019, we are the owner of nine U.S. patents expiring between 2023 and 2034, absent any extensions, as well as eight pending U.S. patent applications. Any patents issuing from the foregoing owned or licensed U.S. applications are expected to expire in between 2034 and 2037, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of April 30, 2019, we owned a total of 119 pending foreign applications and 164 patents in multiple jurisdictions. Any issued patents, or those issuing from these foreign patent applications, are expected to expire between 2023 and 2037, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of April 30, 2019, we also controlled five pending international applications that, if issued, are expected to expire in 2038, absent any adjustments or extensions. The chemical structures of KVD001 and KVD900 are included in composition of matter applications.
 KVD001 is covered by U.S. patents and patent applications covering composition of matter, methods of treatment, solid form and clinical formulations. The anticipated expiration dates of these patents, or patents arising from applications, range from 2032 to 2038, absent any adjustments or extensions. 
 Our portfolio of oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors, including KVD900, is covered by U.S. patent applications and pending international applications covering composition of matter, methods of treatment, solid form and clinical formulations and any patents arising from those applications are expected to expire between 2034 to 2038, absent any adjustments or extensions. 
 Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 
 We also use other forms of protection, such as trademark, copyright and trade secret protection for our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We require our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. In addition, we also require confidentiality or service agreements from third parties that receive confidential information or materials. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 FDA approval process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDA”), warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence in the United States, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA approval requirements prior to 
 11

marketing a pharmaceutical product typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and manufacturing process, as well as toxicity studies in animals to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices and good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”). The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with the information on product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. For the initial IND submission, a 30-day waiting period after the submission of the IND is required prior to the commencement of the clinical trial in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. For subsequent clinical trial protocols submitted to the IND, there is no mandated review time for FDA. Longer duration pre-clinical studies, for example animal tests of reproductive toxicology and carcinogenicity, if required, will be conducted and submitted to the IND throughout the development of the product until sufficient data is available to support submission of an NDA. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), an international standard designed to protect the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”), for approval prior to the start of the clinical trial. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dose, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious or life-threatening outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. 
 The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life- threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical and clinical data, including pharmacology and toxicology results, and the results of other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a application user fee, and once approved, the NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether 
 12

the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the NDA; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the NDA. Priority review can be applied to a drug that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the compliance of manufacturing facilities with GMP, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such additional data in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for the indication being supported. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) if it is considered that additional measures are needed to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include the use of medication guides and communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. 
 Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
 Foreign clinical studies to support an NDA 
 The FDA will accept as support for marketing approval of a product (NDA) well-designed, well-conducted, clinical studies conducted outside of the United States if the studies have been conducted in accordance with the exact same standards of GCP, as required in the United States, and the protocol was submitted to the IND. FDA may validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary. Clinical studies conducted outside the United States are subject to the same rigorous regulatory controls as the United States (see “— Europe / rest of world government regulation” below).
 A sponsor or applicant who wishes to rely on a non-IND foreign clinical study to support an IND must submit documentation to the FDA to demonstrate compliance with GCP. The FDA may also request to inspect a foreign clinical study site to confirm compliance.
 Orphan drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a compound with the potential to treat a rare disease or condition, generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. 
 Orphan drug designation must be requested prior to submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the compound and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. 
 13

Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process of an NDA. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a drug product containing a compound that has FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that drug product for that orphan indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a drug product containing the same active moiety for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a drug product containing a different active moiety for the same disease or condition, or the same drug product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA user fee.
Disclosure of clinical trial information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
 Pediatric information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data.  Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 Other U.S. healthcare laws and compliance requirements 
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector 
 14

General), the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. 
 Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government. reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, PPACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 
 Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offerer or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, imposes obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information.
 Further, pursuant to PPACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, has issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers 
 15

of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The first reports were due in 2014 and must be submitted on an annual basis. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. 
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 Coverage, pricing and reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of its products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third 
 16

party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development. 
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Healthcare reform 
 In March 2010, President Obama enacted the ACA, which has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. 
 Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in 2014 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17

 
• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The current U.S. presidential administration and Congress have sought, and we expect will continue to seek, to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. Since January 2017, the current U.S. presidential administration has issued two executive orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. For example, on October 12, 2017, the current U.S. presidential administration issued an executive order that expands the use of association health plans and allows anyone to purchase short-term health plans that provide temporary, limited insurance. This executive order also calls for the halt of federal payments to health insurers for cost-sharing reductions previously available to lower-income Americans to afford coverage. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact this executive order could have on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, among other things, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, the current U.S. presidential administration signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact the current U.S. presidential administration and the Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the ACA. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our products, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations. 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or 
 18

business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
 Additional regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
 Europe / rest of world government regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country in the European Union. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 To obtain regulatory approval of a drug product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA). The documentation submitted to the FDA in support of an NDA in the United States is almost identical to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Other regulations 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
 Employees 
 As of April 30, 2019, we had a total of 45 full-time employees, of whom 18 were located in the United States and 27 were located in the United Kingdom. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by 
 19

a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with employees to be good.
