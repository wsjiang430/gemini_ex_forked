ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BUSINESS

Our products and services are designed to enhance the player’s experience and increase the profitability of our clients.

History and Development of Galaxy Gaming
 In 1997, Galaxy Gaming Corporation (“GGCORP”) was formed and distributed a side bet for the game of blackjack known as Horseshoe Blackjack.  GGCORP later modified the invention, changed its name to Lucky Ladies and filed for a patent, which was later granted.
 In 2002, Galaxy Gaming, LLC (“GGLLC”) acquired the business and assets of GGCORP.  Lucky Ladies remained GGLLC’s only product until late 2002, when it debuted a new casino poker game called Texas Shootout.  This game quickly became popular with casinos and their customers.  GGLLC later increased its sales force, expanded its distribution channels and introduced new products and services using reinvested earnings.
 Galaxy Gaming, Inc. (“GGINC”) was formed in 2006 and subsequently acquired the assets and business operations of GGLLC.
 In 2009, GGINC executed a share exchange and reverse merger with Secured Diversified Investment, Ltd. (“SDI”).  After the reverse merger, SDI merged with its wholly-owned subsidiary, GGINC, pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.180 and changed the name of the company formerly known as SDI to “Galaxy Gaming, Inc.” which remains the operating company as of the date of this report.
 Products and Services
 Casinos use our proprietary products and services to enhance their gaming floor operations and improve their profitability, productivity and security, as well as to offer popular cutting-edge gaming entertainment content and technology to their players.  We currently serve approximately 600 casinos that use our enhancements on approximately 7,000 gaming tables.  Additional information regarding our products and services may be found on our website, www.galaxygaming.com.  Information found on the website should not be considered part of this report.
 Proprietary Table Games. Casinos use Proprietary Table Games in lieu of other games in the public domain (e.g. Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, etc.) because of their popularity with players and to increase profitability.  Typically, Proprietary Table Games are grouped into two product types referred to as “Side Bets” and “Premium Games.”  Side Bets are proprietary features and wagering options typically added to public domain games such as poker, baccarat, pai gow poker, craps and blackjack table games.  Examples of our Side Bets include Lucky Ladies, 21+3 and Bonus Craps.  Premium Games are unique stand-alone games with their own unique set of rules and strategies.  Examples of our Premium Games include High Card Flush, Three Card Poker and Texas Shootout.  Generally, Premium Games generate higher revenue per table placement than the Side Bet games.
 Enhanced Table Systems.  Enhanced Table Systems are electronic enhancements used on casino table games to add to player appeal and to enhance game security.  An example in this category is our Bonus Jackpot System (“BJS”), an advanced electronic system installed on gaming tables designed to collect data by detecting player wagers and other game activities.  This information is processed and used to improve casino operations by evaluating game play, to improve dealer efficiency and to reward players through the offering of jackpots and other bonusing mechanisms.  Typically, the BJS system includes an electronic video display, known as TableVision, which shows game information designed to generate player interest and to promote various aspects of the game.  The BJS system can also be used to network numerous gaming tables together into a common system either within a casino or through the interconnection of multiple casinos, which we refer to as our Inter-Casino Jackpot System.
 Through August 2018, we had exclusive worldwide rights (excluding one international territory and two U.S. states) to the TableMAX e-Table system, a fully automated, dealer-less, multi-player electronic table game platform through an operating and license agreement executed in 2011 (the “TMAX Agreement”) with TableMAX Gaming, Inc. (“TMAX”). Effective December 29, 2017, we entered into a First Amendment to the TMAX Agreement (the First Amendment”) to, among other things, allow us to retain all net profits generated after the date of the First Amendment and terminate the TMAX Agreement effective upon December 31, 2018. The parties also executed a related settlement and release agreement (the “Settlement and Release Agreement”).  In January 2018, in connection with the First Amendment and the Settlement and Release Agreement, we paid $774,645 to an assignee of TMAX. In August 2018, the TMAX Agreement was terminated.

Significant 2018 Business Developments
 On November 5, 2018, we issued a press release and filed a related Form 8-K announcing that (i) Robert B. Saucier submitted his resignation as a member of our Board effective immediately and his resignation as Executive Vice President of Business Development effective on December 31, 2018; and (ii) that we had retained Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. (“Macquarie”) to assist us in evaluating strategic alternatives, including the potential sale of the shares of our common stock held by Triangulum Partners LLC (“Triangulum”), an entity controlled by Mr. Saucier. See “Note 15 – Subsequent Events” to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further details on 2019 developments related to the strategic alternatives.
 Recurring Revenue and Gross Margins
 A majority of our clients contract with us to use our products and services on a month-to-month basis with typically a 30 – 45 day termination notice requirement.  We invoice our clients monthly, either in advance for unlimited use or in arrears for actual use, depending on the product or contract terms.  Such recurring revenues accounted for over 99% of our total revenues in 2018 and generally have few direct costs thereby generating high gross profit margins.  We do not report “gross profit” in our statements of operations included in this report. Instead, gross profit would be comparable to “revenues” minus “cost of ancillary products and assembled components,” both of which are presented in our statements of operations.
 For more information about our revenues, operating income and assets, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in this report.
 STRATEGY
 We believe that entertaining casino games enhance players’ experiences and generate brand loyalty, resulting in increased profits for our casino clients.  We continue to expand our product offering by focusing on innovative products and services.  As we continue to develop and enhance our brand and reputation, we anticipate adding new product lines and services that complement our overall strategy and enhance our market presence.
 Our long-term business strategy focuses on increasing our value to casino clients by offering them enhanced services and support, and by producing innovative products and game play methodologies that their players enjoy.  We believe that by increasing the value of our products and services to clients, we can continue to build our recurring revenues in both existing and new markets.  To achieve this objective, we employ the following strategies:
  
• | Expand our portfolio of services, products and technologies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase our per unit price point by leveraging our Enhanced Table Systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the number of markets we serve.
--+---------------------------------------

 Expand our portfolio of services, products and technologies.  Our strategy is to be an important vendor to casino operators by offering a complete and comprehensive portfolio of services, games, products, systems, technologies and methodologies for casino table games.  We continuously develop and/or seek to acquire new proprietary table games to complement our existing offerings and to extend our penetration of proprietary table games on the casino floor.  
 Increase our per unit price point by leveraging our Enhanced Table Systems.  Our Enhanced Table Systems provide us with the opportunity to increase the amount of recurring revenue we receive from each table game placement.  Accordingly, our goal is to concentrate on installing new game placements using one or more of our Enhanced Table Systems and to convert our existing Proprietary Table Game placements that currently do not incorporate our Enhanced Table Systems.  We have modified most of our Premium Table Games and many of our Side Bets to benefit from the economics this new system affords us.  In the future, we intend to be able to offer this platform for all games.
 Expand the number of markets we serve. There are table games markets in North America that we do not serve or in which we cannot offer our full suite of products and services.  In general, this is because we are not licensed to serve casinos in that market or the license we have limits the products and services we can provide.  Consequently, we are seeking to increase the number of jurisdictions in which we are licensed and to upgrade those licenses that limit our product and service offering. We intend to expand in table games markets outside of North America.  Finally, we aim to expand by offering our products and services in markets beyond traditional table games.  To this end, we have been active in deploying our game content into the legal online gaming market as well as making our content available on electronic gaming machines.
 COMPETITION
 We compete with several companies that develop and provide proprietary table games, electronic gaming platforms, game enhancements and related services.  We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include products and services that appeal to casinos and players, jurisdictional approvals and a well-developed sales and distribution network. 
 5

We believe that our success will depend upon our ability to remain competitive in our field.  Competition can be based on price, brand recognition, player appeal and the strength of underlying intellectual property. Larger competitors may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, more firmly established supply relationships, superior capital resources, distribution and product inventory than we do.  Smaller competitors may be more able to participate in developing and marketing table games, compared to other gaming products, because of the lower cost and complexity associated with the development of these products and a generally less stringent regulatory environment.  We compete with others in efforts to obtain or create innovative products, obtain financing, acquire other gaming companies, and license and distribute products.  We compete on these bases, as well as on the strength of our sales, service and distribution channels.
 Our competitors include, but are not limited to, Scientific Games Corporation; Play AGS, Inc.; TCS/John Huxley; and Masque Publishing.  Moreover, we expect additional competitors to emerge in the future.  There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and failure to compete successfully in the market could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 SUPPLIERS
 We obtain most of the parts for our products from third party suppliers, including both off-the-shelf items as well as components manufactured to our specifications.  We also assemble a small number of parts in-house that are used both for product assembly and for servicing existing products.  We generally perform warehousing, quality control, final assembly and shipping functions from our facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada, although small inventories are maintained and repairs are performed by our field service employees.  We believe that our sources of supply for components and raw materials are adequate and that alternative sources of materials are available.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 We strive to develop and maintain a robust pipeline of new products and services to bring to market.  We employ a staff of hardware and software engineers, graphic artists and game developers at our corporate offices to support, improve and upgrade our products and to develop and explore other potential table game products, technologies, methodologies and services.  We also use contracted third party developers and engineers.
 We incurred $926,474 and $488,829 in research and development expenditures during 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in 2018 was primarily attributable to our increased focus on development of new products and services.
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Our products and the intellectual property associated with them are typically protected by patents, trademarks, copyrights and non-compete agreements.  However, there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States, which could increase the likelihood of infringement.  Furthermore, other companies could develop similar or superior products without violating our intellectual property rights.  If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the proceedings could be burdensome, disruptive and expensive, and distract the attention of management, and there can be no assurance that we would prevail.
 We have been subject to litigation claiming that we have infringed the rights of others and/or that certain of our patents and other intellectual property are invalid or unenforceable.  We have also brought actions against others to protect our rights.  
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 We are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in most jurisdictions in which we offer our products.  The development and distribution of casino games, gaming equipment, systems technology and related services, as well as the operation of casinos, are all subject to regulation by a variety of federal, state, international, tribal, and local agencies with the majority of oversight provided by individual state gaming control boards. While the regulatory requirements vary by jurisdiction, most require:

• | Findings of suitability for the company, individual officers, directors, key employees and major shareholders;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Documentation of qualification, including evidence of financial stability;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Specific product approvals for games and gaming equipment; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Licenses, registrations and/or permits.
--+----------------------------------------

 Gaming regulatory requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and obtaining licenses, registrations, findings of suitability for our officers, directors, and principal stockholders and other required approvals with respect to us, our personnel and our products are time consuming and expensive.  Generally, gaming regulatory authorities have broad discretionary powers and may deny applications for or revoke approvals on any basis they deem reasonable.  We have approvals that enable us to conduct our business in numerous jurisdictions, subject in each case to the conditions of the particular approvals.  These conditions may include limitations as to the type 
 6

of game or product we may sell or lease, as well as limitations on the type of facility, such as riverboats, and the territory within which we may operate, such as tribal nations.  Gaming laws and regulations serve to protect the public interest and ensure gambling related activity is conducted honestly, competitively, and free of corruption.  Regulatory oversight additionally ensures that the local authorities receive the appropriate amount of gaming tax revenues.  As such, our financial systems and reporting functions must demonstrate high levels of detail and integrity.
 We also have authorizations with certain Native American tribes throughout the United States that have compacts with the states in which their tribal dominions are located or operate or propose to operate casinos. These tribes generally require suppliers of gaming and gaming-related equipment to obtain authorizations.  Gaming on Native American lands within the United States is governed by the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (“IGRA”) and specific tribal ordinances and regulations. Class III gaming (table games and slot machines, for example), as defined under IGRA, also requires a Tribal-State Compact, which is a written agreement between a specific tribe and the respective state. This compact authorizes the type of Class III gaming activity and the standards, procedures and controls under which the Class III gaming activity must be conducted. The National Indian Gaming Commission (“NIGC”) has oversight authority over gaming on Native American lands and generally monitors tribal gaming, including the establishment and enforcement of required minimum internal control standards. Each tribe is sovereign and must have a tribal gaming commission or office established to regulate tribal gaming activity to ensure compliance with IGRA, NIGC, and its Tribal-State Compact. We have complied with each of the numerous vendor licensing, specific product approvals and shipping notification requirements imposed by Tribal-State Compacts and enforced by tribal and/or state gaming agencies under IGRA in the Native American lands in which we do business.
 The nature of the industry and our worldwide operations make the license application process very time consuming and require extensive resources.  We engage legal resources familiar with local customs in certain jurisdictions to assist in keeping us compliant with applicable regulations worldwide.  Through this process, we seek to assure both regulators and investors that all our operations maintain the highest levels of integrity and avoid any appearance of impropriety.
 We have obtained or applied for all required government licenses, permits, registrations, findings of suitability and approvals necessary to develop and distribute gaming products in all jurisdictions where we directly operate.  Although many regulations at each level are similar or overlapping, we must satisfy all conditions individually for each jurisdiction. Additionally, in certain jurisdictions we license our products through distributors authorized to do business in those jurisdictions.
 In addition to what may be required of our officers, board members, key employees and substantial interest holders, any of our stakeholders, including but not limited to investors, may be subject to regulatory requests and suitability findings.  Failure to comply with regulatory requirements or obtaining a finding of unsuitability by a regulatory body could result in a substantial or total loss of investment.
 In the future, we intend to seek the necessary registrations, licenses, approvals, and findings of suitability for us, our products, and our personnel in other jurisdictions throughout the world.  However, we may be unable to obtain such necessary items, or if such items are obtained, may be revoked, suspended, or conditioned.  In addition, we may be unable to obtain on a timely basis, or to obtain at all, the necessary approvals of our future products as they are developed, even in those jurisdictions in which we already have existing products licensed or approved.  If the necessary registrations are not sought after or the required approvals not received, we may be prohibited from selling our products in that jurisdiction or may be required to sell our products through other licensed entities at a reduced profit.
 EMPLOYEES 
 We have 40 full-time employees, including executive officers, management personnel, accounting personnel, office staff, sales staff, service technicians and research and development personnel.  As needed, we also employ part-time and temporary employees and pay for the services of independent contractors.
