ITEM 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 The overall goal of our Company is to empower the global community to improve health and wellness by providing access to accurate essential information.  Our business is made up of two principal segments. The first is our “OSUR” business, which consists of the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of oral fluid diagnostic products and specimen collection devices using our proprietary technologies, as well as other diagnostic products including immunoassays and other in vitro diagnostic tests that are used on other specimen types. Our diagnostic products include tests for diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C that are performed on a rapid basis at the point of care and tests that are processed in a laboratory. These products are sold in the United States and internationally to various clinical laboratories, hospitals, clinics, community-based organizations and other public health organizations, distributors, government agencies, physicians’ offices, and commercial and industrial entities. We also manufacture and sell medical devices used for the removal of benign skin lesions by cryosurgery or freezing. These cryosurgical products are sold in both professional and over-the-counter (“OTC”) markets in North America, Europe, Central and South America, and Australia. 
 The second segment is our “DNAG” or molecular collection systems business and is operated primarily through our subsidiary, DNA Genotek Inc. (“DNAG”), a company based in Ottawa, Canada. In the DNAG business we manufacture and sell kits that are used to collect, stabilize, transport and store samples of genetic material for molecular testing in the consumer genetic, clinical genetic, academic research, pharmacogenomics, personalized medicine, microbiome and animal genetics markets. Our Oragene® DNA sample collection kit provides an all-in-one system for the collection, stabilization, transportation and storage of DNA from human saliva. We also sell research use only products into the microbiome and tuberculosis markets and we offer our customers a suite of genomics and microbiome services that range from package customization and study design optimization to extraction, analysis and reporting services. We serve customers in many countries worldwide, including many leading research universities and hospitals. 
 OraSure was formed in May 2000 under Delaware law solely for the purposes of combining two companies, STC Technologies, Inc. (“STC Technologies”) and Epitope, Inc. (“Epitope”), and changing the state of incorporation of Epitope from Oregon to Delaware. STC Technologies and Epitope were merged into OraSure on September 29, 2000. Our principal offices are located at 220 East First Street, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania 18015, and our telephone number is (610) 882-1820. 
 Additional information about us can be found on our website, www.orasure.com. We make available free of charge through a link provided at such website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as well as any amendments to those Reports and filings. These Reports and filings are made available as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our website and the information contained in or connected to that website are not intended to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. 
 Recent Developments
 In early January 2019, we acquired two privately-held, early-stage companies, CoreBiome, Inc. (“CoreBiome”) and Novosanis N.V. (“Novosanis”), in order to add differentiated products and services to our molecular collection systems business.
 CoreBiome, a spin-off from the University of Minnesota, is based in St. Paul, Minnesota and provides microbiome laboratory and analytical services that can accelerate research and discovery for customers in the pharmaceutical, agricultural and academic research communities. These services provide optimal analytical algorithms to deliver speed and scalability in the lab with highly precise analytics.  CoreBiome was co-founded in 2016 by Dr. Dan Knights, a globally-recognized expert in microbiome informatics who has developed leading methods for analyzing microbiome data, along with Dr. Daryl Gohl and Dr. Kenny Beckman, domain experts in genomics methods and clinical lab operations.  
 Novosanis was a Belgian company founded as a spin-off from the University of Antwerp, Belgium in 2013.  Novosanis is an early commercial stage producer and distributor of urine sample collection devices targeting the liquid biopsy and sexually transmitted infection screening markets.  Novosanis’ primary product is Colli-Pee, an easy to use device designed for the standardized collection of first-void urine which can be used in the privacy of the user’s home or in a clinic.  Product validation and clinical trials are also under way with various sexually transmitted infection test manufacturers.
 The acquisitions of both CoreBiome and Novosanis were structured with modest up-front payments and potential additional payments based on future performance of each company.  These acquisitions are the first steps in the execution against our long-term strategy of becoming a growth company focused on innovation, both internally and through acquisitions of companies and technologies outside of our existing core businesses.

OraQuick® Rapid HIV Test 
 OraQuick® is our rapid point-of-care test platform designed to test oral fluid, whole blood (i.e., both finger-stick and venous), plasma and serum samples for the presence of various antibodies or analytes. The device uses a porous flat pad to collect an oral fluid specimen. After collection, the pad is inserted into a vial containing a pre-measured amount of developer solution and allowed to develop. When blood, plasma or serum is to be tested, a loop collection device is used to collect a drop of the specimen and mix it in the developer solution, after which the collection pad is inserted into the solution and allowed to develop. In all cases, the specimen and developer solution then flow through the testing device where test results are observable in approximately 20 minutes. The OraQuick® device is a screening test and generally requires a confirmation test where an initial positive result is obtained. 
 This product is sold under the OraQuick ADVANCE® name in North America, Europe and certain other countries and under the OraQuick® name in other developing countries. The test has received PMA approval from the FDA for the detection of antibodies to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 in oral fluid, finger-stick whole blood, venous whole blood and plasma. This test is available for use by laboratories located in the United States certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment of 1988, or CLIA, to perform moderately complex tests. We have also received a CLIA waiver for use of the test with oral fluid and finger-stick and venous whole blood. As a result, the test can be used by numerous additional sites in the United States not certified under CLIA to perform moderately complex tests, such as outreach clinics, community-based organizations and physicians’ offices. 
 On the international front, we have obtained a CE mark for our OraQuick ADVANCE® test so that we can sell this product in Europe and other countries accepting the CE mark for commercialization and this product is registered in other countries. We have distributors in place for several countries and are seeking to increase awareness and expand our distribution network for this product throughout the world. We have also received WHO pre-qualification for our export-only version of this product. 
 OraQuick® In-Home HIV Test 
 The OraQuick® In-Home HIV test is an over-the-counter oral-fluid only version of our OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV 1/2 Antibody Test. We received PMA approval to sell this test in the U.S. OTC market. We have also received a CE mark for the OraQuick® In-Home HIV test, although this product is not currently sold in the European Union. The In-Home test is performed in the same manner as the OraQuick ADVANCE® test, except that it has product labeling and instructions designed for consumers. In addition, we have established toll-free, 24/7, 365-day per year customer telephone support to provide additional information and referral services for consumers. 
 OraQuick® HIV Self-Test 
 The OraQuick® HIV Self-Test uses the same diagnostic technology as our U.S. approved OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV test but is sold into certain foreign countries at a lower cost to meet the needs of those markets. For the past several years, we have worked with Population Services International (“PSI”), a leading global health organization, along with UNITAID, the WHO and health officials from several African countries to deploy our Self-Test through the UNITAID-PSI HIV Self-Testing in Africa (“STAR”) project. The OraQuick® Self-Test has labeling and instructions specifically tailored for the African marketplace. The purpose of the STAR project was to generate crucial information about how best to deliver HIV self-testing, how to generate demand for HIV testing in this manner and what the potential public health impact of self-testing will be. Our OraQuick® Self-Test was chosen by PSI because of its quality, ease-of-use and oral fluid option. This product has received WHO pre-qualification and is eligible for procurement by purchasing entities entitled to access funding and other resources from the Global Fund, UNITAID and other agencies.  During 2018, a majority of the sales of our OraQuick® HIV Self-Test occurred outside of the STAR project. 
 OraQuick® HCV Rapid Antibody Test 
 Another test available on the OraQuick® platform is the OraQuick® HCV rapid antibody test. This product is a qualitative test that can detect antibodies to the hepatitis C virus, or HCV, in a variety of sample types. The OraQuick® HCV test operates in substantially the same manner as the OraQuick® HIV test. 
 We have received FDA approval and CLIA waiver for use of the test in detecting HCV antibodies in venous whole blood and finger-stick whole blood specimens, making it the first and only rapid HCV test approved by the FDA for use in the United States. The OraQuick® HCV test has received a CE mark for use with oral fluid, venous whole blood, finger-stick whole blood, plasma and serum and is sold in Europe. This product is also registered and sold in other foreign countries and has received WHO pre-qualification. 
 OraQuick® Ebola Rapid Antigen Test 
 In 2015, we completed development of our new rapid Ebola test. This product utilizes the OraQuick® technology platform for the detection of Ebola antigen. This test has received EUAs from the FDA for emergency use by laboratories and facilities adequately equipped, trained and capable of testing for Ebola infection (including treatment centers and public health clinics) on finger-stick and 
 6


venous whole blood samples collected from live patients, as well as oral fluid specimens collected from cadavers. The WHO has also issued an Emergency Use Assessment and Listing for this product with respect to the same specimen types. 
 OraSure QuickFlu® Rapid Flu A&B Test 
 The OraSure QuickFlu® Rapid Flu A&B test is an FDA 510(k) cleared rapid qualitative test for the detection of influenza (flu) Types A and B, including H1N1 viral infections. The test utilizes specimen collected with a nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab or nasal aspirate/wash. A reagent is first inserted into a test cartridge, the specimen is added and the test is allowed to flow. Results are available in as little as 10 minutes. This product is manufactured for us under an agreement with Princeton BioMeditech Corporation (“PBM”) and is currently sold in certain U.S. markets. PBM has also obtained a CLIA waiver for this test for use with nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs. 
 OraSure® Collection Device 
 Our OraSure® oral fluid collection device is used in conjunction with screening and confirmatory tests for HIV-1 antibodies. The generic version of this product can be used for other analytes. This device consists of a small, treated cotton-fiber pad on a handle that is placed in a person’s mouth for two to five minutes. The device collects oral mucosal transudate (“OMT”), a serum-derived fluid that contains higher concentrations of certain antibodies and analytes than saliva. As a result, OMT testing is a highly accurate method for detecting HIV-1 infection and other analytes. 
 The OraSure® collection device is FDA approved for use in the detection of HIV-1 antibodies. The generic version is a Class I medical device for the detection of cocaine and cotinine in oral fluid specimens. HIV-1 antibody detection using the OraSure® collection device involves three steps: 
  
• | Collection of an oral fluid specimen using the OraSure® device;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Screening of the specimen for HIV-1 antibodies at a laboratory with an enzyme immunoassay (“EIA”) screening test approved by the FDA for use with the OraSure® device; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Laboratory confirmation of any positive screening test results with either a western blot confirmatory test or a blood based nucleic acid test.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A trained health care professional then conveys test results and provides appropriate counseling to the individual who was tested. 
 Tuberculosis (“TB”) Products 
 OMNIgene® • SPUTUM is a non-toxic and highly stable reagent that liquefies and decontaminates sputum samples at the point-of-collection or in the lab while preserving the viability of TB bacteria for at least eight (8) days at ambient temperatures. Optimized samples are compatible with all routine TB tests, enable cost-effective sample transport and simplify laboratory workflows while eliminating the need for lab reagents that require daily mixing and quality control. We believe OMNIGENE® • SPUTUM can improve laboratory and operational workflows compared to current approaches, and improve overall test results. This product is being offered to TB laboratories for evaluation. 
 The OMNIgene® • SPUTUM product is CE marked and is gaining greater interest for tuberculosis testing. Healthcare providers from more than 60 countries have expressed interest in evaluating this product and business entities, ranging from Ministries of Health, non-government organizations, donor agencies and diagnostic test developers, have begun their product evaluations. Our tuberculosis products are well positioned to support the U.S. government’s National Action Plan for combatting multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, by providing much needed solutions to developing countries that are at the highest risk for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. 
 Molecular Collection Systems 
 Genomics Products.  We sell a number of genomic products that provide all-in-one systems for the collection, stabilization, transportation, and storage of DNA and/or RNA from human and animal biologic samples. Our lead product is sold under the Oragene® brand and is used to collect DNA from human saliva. These products are currently sold to thousands of academic research and commercial customers in many countries worldwide. 
 Our genomic products are available in several different configurations and contain proprietary chemical solutions that are optimized for the specific application for which each product is designed. Product physical design is focused on ease-of-use and reliability for self or assisted collection of samples. For example, several of the Oragene® products require users to simply hold the product close to their mouth and spit into the collection device. When the container is closed, the reagents stored in the lid of the container are mixed 
 7


with the captured saliva and immediately protect the nucleic acids in the sample. This non-invasive collection method yields nucleic acid that remains stable at ambient temperature for extended periods. The stabilizing technology results in high quality and high quantity nucleic acids that are required for most genetic testing and analysis methods. 
 Microbiome Products.  We also market several microbiome collection products designed to collect, stabilize and transport the microbial profile from multiple sample types. Unlike genomic DNA, the microbiome of a sample can change over time, especially when exposed to temperature and environment fluctuations. In order to optimize and standardize sample results, a reliable method that captures and preserves (“snapshots”) the microbiome after collection until analysis is required. We believe our products provide such a reliable method. 
 Our OMNIgene® • GUT product is an all-in-one system designed to enable an individual to easily self-collect high quality microbial DNA from feces or stool samples for gut microbiome profiling for use in clinical laboratory and research settings. Current methodologies for gut microbiome profiling have distinct shortcomings due to the introduction of bias, leading to a lack of reproducibility in the field.  Our product ensures that the fecal sample is fully stabilized immediately upon collection and maintains an accurate and reliable bacterial profile for weeks at room temperature. We have also begun marketing other microbiome collection kits for DNA or RNA collected from the vagina and oral cavity. 
 We believe these products provide significant advantages over competing DNA and RNA collection methods such as blood collection or buccal swabs, particularly in human genetic applications. Benefits include the reliable collection of high-quality and stable genetic samples, use of simple non-invasive collection methods, the ability to store and transport collected samples for extended periods at ambient temperatures and compatibility with fully-automated laboratory testing systems. 
 Molecular Services.  Our molecular business also offers customers our GenoFINDTM services, a suite of genomic and microbiome services that range from package customization and study design optimization to extraction, analysis and reporting services. Our GenoFINDTM offering has become an increasingly valuable tool for meeting the needs of our molecular customers.  With the acquisition of CoreBiome, we believe we can offer enhanced laboratory service offerings for our customers in the microbiome market.
 Regulatory Approvals.  Our molecular collection products historically have been sold primarily as Class I medical devices for use by research and academic institutions. We have received FDA 510(k) clearance of the Oragene® • DX product for use with the eSensor® Warfarin sensitivity saliva test. A separate 510(k) clearance permits self-collection by consumers when the sample is to be tested with either an exempt or 510(k) cleared molecular test. Our ORAcollect® product similarly received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. We have also received CE mark approval for the Oragene® • DNA, ORAcollect® and OMNIgene® • GUT collection kits. 
 Intercept® Drug Testing System 
 A collection device that is substantially similar to the OraSure® device is sold under the name Intercept®, and is used to collect oral mucosal transudate or OMT for oral fluid drug testing. We have received FDA 510(k) clearance to use the Intercept® collection device with laboratory-based EIAs to test for drugs-of-abuse commonly identified by the National Institute for Drug Abuse (“NIDA”) as the NIDA-5 (i.e., tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC” or marijuana), cocaine, opiates, amphetamines/methamphetamines and phencyclidine (“PCP”)), and for barbiturates, methadone and benzodiazepines. Each of these EIAs is also FDA 510(k) cleared for use with the Intercept® device. Our Intercept® device and oral fluid assays are sold in the U.S. primarily through laboratory distributors. 
 We believe that the Intercept® device has several advantages over competing urine and other drugs-of-abuse testing products, including its lower total testing cost, its non-invasive nature, mobility and accuracy, the ease of maintaining a chain-of-custody, the treatment of test subjects with greater dignity, no requirement for specially-prepared collection facilities and difficulty of sample adulteration. The availability of an oral fluid test is intended to allow our customers to test for drug impairment and eliminate scheduling costs and inconvenience, thereby streamlining the testing process. 
 We have also developed a next-generation collection device, which we are marketing under the tradename “Intercept i2® he”. This device offers several important advantages over our original Intercept® device, including a sample adequacy indicator that provides a visual prompt when the appropriate volume of oral fluid has been collected, the ability to collect a larger sample required by current laboratory testing protocols and a more optimized chemistry that results in improved recovery of the targeted drug analytes. The Intercept i2®he device is currently being sold as a forensic use only device within the criminal justice and drug treatment markets along with a NIDA-5 panel of fully-automated high-throughput oral fluid drug assays that we distribute under an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific (“Thermo Fisher”).

Cryosurgical Systems (Skin Lesion Removal Products) 
 The Histofreezer® cryosurgical removal system is a low-cost alternative to liquid nitrogen and other methods for removal of warts and other benign skin lesions by physicians. The Histofreezer® product mixes three cryogenic gases in a small aerosol canister. When released, these gases are delivered to a specially designed foam bud, cooling the bud to a maximum of –50°C to –55°C. The frozen bud is then applied to the wart or lesion for 15 to 40 seconds (depending on the type of lesion) creating localized destruction of the target area by freezing. We have received 510(k) clearance for use of the Histofreezer® product to remove common warts and eight other types of benign skin lesions, and this product has been CE-marked and registered for distribution in Canada, throughout Europe and in certain other foreign countries. We also supply this product on a private label basis for resale by one of our physician office distributors. 
 Internationally, we sell an OTC cryosurgical product through our distributor Genomma Labs (“Genomma”), under the POINTTS tradename, in Mexico and a number of South and Central American countries. We sell a CE-marked cryosurgical wart removal product into the OTC foot care market in Europe, Australia and New Zealand through our distributor, Reckitt Benckiser (“Reckitt”), under the Scholl and Dr. Scholl trademarks. Reckitt is the owner of the Scholl and Dr. Scholl trademarks in countries outside North and South America. We also sell OTC cryosurgical products to retailers on a private label basis for the treatment of warts in the U.S., for the treatment of both warts and skin tags in Canada and for the treatment of skin tags in the U.K. 
 Immunoassay Tests and Reagents 
 We develop and sell immunoassay tests in formats, known as MICRO-PLATE and AUTO-LYTE®, to meet the specific needs of our customers. We also sell fully-automated high-throughput oral fluid drug assays developed under our agreement with Thermo Fisher. 
 In a MICRO-PLATE kit, the sample to be tested is placed into a small plastic receptacle, called a microwell, along with the reagents. The result of the test is determined by the color of the microwell upon completion of the reaction. Controlling the reaction involves the use of reagents by laboratory personnel. Test results are analyzed by any of a variety of commercially available laboratory instruments, which we may also provide to our laboratory customers. MICRO-PLATE tests can be performed on commonly used instruments and can detect drugs in urine, serum and sweat specimens. MICRO-PLATE tests are also used as part of the Intercept® product line to detect drugs-of-abuse in oral fluid specimens. 
 AUTO-LYTE® tests are sold in the form of bottles of liquid reagents. These reagents are run on commercially available laboratory-based automated analytical instruments, which are manufactured by a variety of third parties. AUTO-LYTE® is typically used in high volume, automated, commercial reference insurance laboratories to detect certain drugs or chemicals in urine. Test results are produced quickly, allowing for high throughput. Our AUTO-LYTE® tests continue to face strong competition from cheaper “home-brew” tests developed internally by our laboratory customers. As a result, we may eventually stop selling our AUTO-LYTE® tests. 
 We previously entered into an agreement with Thermo Fisher under which Thermo Fisher would develop and supply up to 12 fully-automated high-throughput oral fluid drug assays for use with our Intercept i2® device. Under this agreement, we are currently selling a NIDA-5 panel of assays supplied by Thermo Fisher in the U.S. forensic market. The parties are discussing certain changes to this agreement and assessing their ability to complete development of several additional assays and pursue FDA 510(k) clearance, CE marking and other regulatory approvals of the Intercept i2® device for use with a 12-assay panel. Subject to these further discussions with Thermo Fisher, we believe the offering of an Intercept i2® device with a full menu of fully-automated high-throughput oral fluid assays will better meet the needs of our laboratory drug testing customers and allow us to compete more effectively against fully automated urine drug assays that dominate the drug testing market. 
 Q.E.D.® Saliva Alcohol Test 
 Our Q.E.D.® saliva alcohol test is a point-of-care test device that is a cost-effective alternative to breath or blood alcohol testing. The test is a quantitative, saliva-based method for the detection of ethanol, has been cleared for sale by the FDA and has received a CLIA waiver. The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) has also approved the test. 
 Each Q.E.D.® test kit contains a collection stick that is used to collect a sample of saliva and a disposable detection device that displays results in a format similar to a thermometer. The Q.E.D.® device is easy to operate and instrumentation is not required to read the result. The product has a testing range of 0 to 0.145% blood alcohol and produces results in approximately two minutes.

Products Under Development 
 Infectious Disease 
 One recent area of focus for product development has been our OraQuick® Ebola rapid antigen test. In July 2015, we received an Emergency Use Authorization or EUA for our Ebola test from the FDA. This authorization allows the use of the product for the duration of the U.S. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) August 5, 2014 declaration regarding the emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for the detection of the Ebola virus. Under this authorization, the test can be used on finger-stick and venous whole blood samples collected from live patients. 
 In June 2015, we entered into a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (“BARDA”) within the HHS for up to $10.4 million of funding for our OraQuick® Ebola test. The three-year, multi-phased contract included an initial commitment of $1.8 million and options for up to an additional $8.6 million to fund certain clinical and regulatory activities. In September 2015 and July 2017, BARDA exercised an option to provide $7.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in additional funding for our OraQuick® Ebola test. 
 In March 2016, we received an EUA for use of the Ebola test on oral fluid samples collected from cadavers. The WHO has issued an Emergency Use Assessment and Listing, or EUAL, for use of the product with whole blood samples collected from live patients and with oral fluid samples collected from cadavers. These approvals will allow expanded use of the product, particularly in Africa. We also intend to seek 510(k) clearance of our Ebola test from the FDA in the future. 
 Our recent product development efforts also focused on addressing global concerns regarding the Zika virus. As a result, we began developing a rapid Zika antibody test on our OraQuick® platform. In August 2016, we entered into a contract with BARDA for up to $16.6 million of funding for our OraQuick® Zika test. The six-year, multi-phased contract included an initial commitment of $7.0 million and options for up to an additional $9.6 million to fund the evaluation of additional product enhancements, and certain clinical and regulatory activities. In May 2017, BARDA exercised an option to provide $2.6 million in additional funding for our rapid Zika test. 
 During 2018, because of difficulties in completing development and optimizing our Zika test and because of significant uncertainty regarding the future commercial demand for this product, the scope of this contract was reduced.  As a result, our contract with BARDA will be essentially completed in the first quarter of 2019.  
 Molecular Collections 
 In order to intersect evolving customer needs within the academic and commercial markets, our molecular business product development pipeline is focused on extending offerings across different sample types and analytes within both the genomics and microbiome areas. Genomic customers are demonstrating an increasing demand for RNA collection and stabilization. On the microbiome front, we continue to focus research and development work on collecting and stabilizing microbial DNA and RNA from multiple sample types including gut, skin, and saliva. We are also evolving the physical design and features of our products to further enable high throughput processing through improved interoperability with automated platforms. 
Research and Development
 Research and development expenses were $16.3 million in 2018, $13.4 million in 2017, and $9.8 million in 2016. These expenses include our costs associated with research and development, regulatory affairs, clinical trials and product support. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We attempt to reach our major target markets through a combination of direct sales, strategic arrangements and independent distributors. Our marketing strategy is to create or raise awareness through a full array of marketing activities, which include trade shows, print advertising, special programs, distributor promotions, telemarketing and the use of digital and social media in order to stimulate sales in each target market.

We market our products in the United States and internationally. Consolidated net revenues attributable to customers in the United States were $136.8 million, $121.5 million and $99.8 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Consolidated net revenues attributable to international customers amounted to $44.9 million, $45.6 million and $28.4 million, or 25%, 27% and 22% of our total revenues, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For more information about our revenues and long-lived assets attributable to U.S. and international customers, please see Notes 2 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 Infectious Disease Testing - Professional 
 We market the OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 antibody test directly to customers in the public health market for HIV testing. This market consists of a broad range of clinics and laboratories and includes states, counties, and other governmental agencies, family planning clinics, colleges and universities, correctional facilities and the military. There are also a number of organizations in the public health market, such as AIDS service organizations and various community-based organizations that are set up primarily for the purpose of encouraging and enabling HIV testing. We also sell our OraQuick ADVANCE® test directly to hospitals in the U.S. and through distributors into the U.S. physician office market and to retail clinics operated by pharmacies. In addition, we distribute our OraQuick® HIV test in certain other foreign countries. 
 Our OraQuick® HCV test is sold primarily to the same markets where our OraQuick® ADVANCE HIV test is sold, including public health organizations, hospitals, physicians and retail clinics. We also sell this test in other countries through distributors. A focus for our HCV business has been, and will continue to be, to market our test to foreign countries that intend to implement broad scale testing programs. 
 We currently sell our OraQuick® Ebola test under an EUA and our only customer to date has been the CDC, which has purchased the product for field testing in Africa. There were no Ebola sales in 2018. Our ability to expand sales of this test to other customers will likely depend on the timing and extent of future outbreaks of the disease, the availability of government or other funding and whether we are able to obtain FDA 510(k) clearance and pre-qualification with the WHO for our product. 
 We market the OraSure® oral fluid collection device for HIV-1 testing, on its own and as a kit in combination with laboratory testing services. To better serve our public health customers, we have contracted a commercial laboratory to provide prepackaged OraSure® test kits, with prepaid laboratory testing and specimen shipping costs included. We also sell the OraSure® device in the international public health market. 
 We have distribution rights to an FDA 510(k) cleared and CLIA waived rapid flu A&B test, which we market under our proprietary OraSure QuickFlu® tradename. Under our agreement with the supplier of this product, we are permitted to sell this product into the U.S. hospital and public health markets. 
 We have also been working to commercialize the OMNIgene® • SPUTUM product. TB is a major global health issue, with long established relationships among public health agencies, NGOs, and suppliers. We have a focused sales and market development team working with these key players to have our product evaluated and adopted where possible. 
 Infectious Disease Testing - OTC 
 We sell our OraQuick® In-Home test in the U.S. retail or consumer market. Retailers carrying the product include CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid and Wal-Mart. The product is also available for purchase on-line through certain retailers and our website, www.oraquick.com. The primary target population for our HIV-OTC test is comprised of young, sexually active adults, with greater purchase intent found in high-risk sub-groups, such as men who have sex with men, African Americans and Latino Americans. 
 To support individuals that purchase and use our test, we offer toll-free customer support on a 24/7, 365-day per year basis. This service provides consumers with access to trained representatives who can answer questions about HIV/AIDS and the use of our test, and refer consumers to appropriate resources for follow-up confirmatory testing, counseling and medical treatment. 
 In 2016, we began selling our OraQuick® HIV Self-Test to PSI (Population Services International) for use in a self-testing pilot program called the HIV Self-Testing in Africa, or STAR, project. Under Phase I of the project, 750,000 OraQuick® HIV Self-Tests were sold to PSI for use in three African countries, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. More recently, we were selected to participate in Phase II of the project under which approximately 4 million HIV Self-Tests are expected to be deployed over a two-year period. 
 11


In June 2017, we entered into a Charitable Support Agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (“Gates Foundation”) that has enabled us to offer our OraQuick® HIV Self-Test at an affordable price in 50 developing countries in Africa and Asia with funding from the Gates Foundation. The funding consists of support payments tied to the volume of product we sell and reimbursement of certain related costs. The agreement has a four-year term and enables non-governmental organizations in the eligible countries that receive funding from government or public sector agencies and donors to access our HIV Self-Test at reduced pricing. The funding from the Gates Foundation will be in an aggregate amount not to exceed $20.0 million over the four-year term or $6.0 million each year of the agreement. 
 In July 2017, our OraQuick® HIV Self-Test was prequalified by the WHO. WHO prequalification aims to ensure that diagnostic tests for high burden diseases meet global standards of quality, safety, and efficacy in order to optimize use of health resources and improve health outcomes. WHO prequalification enables governmental organizations implementing HIV Self-Test pilots and programs to access international funding to purchase our test. 
 Molecular Collection Systems 
 DNAG sells its products directly to its customers, primarily through its own internal sales force. In some countries distributors are used. Over half of DNAG’s employees work in the areas of sales, marketing, business development or product management. The significant majority of employees who deal directly with customers have molecular science backgrounds, which we believe is useful in selling and marketing molecular collection products, and more importantly, in identifying and evaluating new market and business opportunities. 
 Most of DNAG’s revenues are derived from product sales to commercial customers and into the academic and research markets. Sales to commercial customers providing consumer genetics and clinical diagnostic services have been increasing and account for a majority of DNAG’s revenues. A significant portion of DNAG’s sales are derived from repeat customers, in both markets. DNAG also has customers in the livestock and companion animal markets. 
 DNAG has expanded its market focus by developing new collection devices for the emerging microbiome market, which is focused on the study of microbes and their effect on human health. DNAG’s primary product offering in the microbiome market, OMNIgene® • GUT, is focused on the human gut microbiome (microbes living in human stool). DNAG is leveraging its existing sales force and global research connections to engage microbiome customers around the world to establish itself as the leader in ease-of-collection, stabilization and transport of this challenging sample type. In addition, DNAG is offering laboratory and analytics services in order to more fully meet the needs of its customers.
 Substance Abuse Testing 
 Our substance abuse testing products are marketed to laboratories serving the workplace testing, forensic toxicology, criminal justice and drug rehabilitation markets in the U.S. and certain international markets. 
 We have entered into agreements for the distribution of our Intercept® collection device and associated MICRO-PLATE assays for drugs-of-abuse testing in the workplace testing market in the United States and Canada through several laboratory distributors and internationally for workplace, criminal justice and forensic toxicology testing through other distributors. We also market the Intercept® collection device on its own and as a kit in combination with laboratory testing services. To better serve our workplace customers, we have contracted with commercial laboratories to provide prepackaged Intercept® test kits, with prepaid laboratory testing and specimen shipping costs included. 
 The criminal justice market in the United States for our substance abuse testing products consists of a wide variety of entities in the criminal justice system that require drug screening, such as pre-trial services, parole and probation offices, police forces, drug courts, prisons, drug treatment programs and community/family service programs. The forensic toxicology market consists of several hundred laboratories including federal, state and county crime laboratories, medical examiner laboratories and reference laboratories. 
 As discussed above, we also sell our next generation Intercept i2® collection device with a NIDA-5 panel of fully-automated high-throughput oral fluid assays developed with Thermo Fisher for the detection of PCP, THC, opiates, cocaine, methamphetamines and amphetamines. These products are currently sold into the criminal justice and drug treatment markets. Subject to our further discussions with Thermo Fisher, we plan to obtain FDA 510(k) clearance of our Intercept i2® device for use with the NIDA-5 assay panel, along with an additional six fully-automated high-throughput assays in order to expand sales of this product line into the workplace testing market and other markets that require 510(k) cleared drug tests. We expect that the 510(k) cleared Intercept i2® device and related fully-automated high-throughput assays will eventually replace our original Intercept® collector and MICRO-PLATE assays in the drug testing market. 
 12


We distribute our Q.E.D.® saliva alcohol test primarily through various distributors in the United States and internationally. The markets for alcohol testing are relatively small and fragmented with a broad range of legal and procedural barriers to entry. Markets range from law enforcement testing to workplace testing of employees in safety sensitive occupations. Typical usage situations include pre-employment, random, post-accident, reasonable-cause and return-to-duty testing. 
 Cryosurgical Systems 
 Most of our Histofreezer® sales occur in the United States to distributors that, in turn, resell the product to primary care physicians and podiatrists in the United States. Our major U.S. distributors include Cardinal Healthcare, McKesson Medical-Surgical, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and Henry Schein. We have engaged a manufacturers’ representative organization to help our U.S. distributors promote and sell Histofreezer®. We also provide a private label version of our professional Histofreezer® product to one of our U.S. distributors. Internationally, we sell the Histofreezer® product through a network of distributors in more than 20 countries worldwide. 
 We distribute cryosurgical wart removal products in the OTC foot care market in Europe, Australia and New Zealand through our distributor, Reckitt Benckiser, under its Scholl and Dr. Scholl tradenames, and in the OTC markets in Mexico and several Central and South American countries under the POINTTS tradename through our distributor, Genomma. We sell our product in the U.K. through another distributor, Appia, under the CryoTag tradename, for the removal of skin tags. We also sell OTC private label cryosurgical products for the removal of warts and skin tags in Canada and for the removal of warts in the U.S. 
 Insurance Risk Assessment 
 We currently market the OraSure® oral fluid collection device for use in screening life insurance applicants in the United States and internationally to test for three of the most important underwriting risk factors: HIV-1, cocaine and cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine). Devices are sold to insurance testing laboratories, which in turn sell the devices to insurance companies, usually in combination with testing services. 
 We also promote use of the OraSure® device directly to insurance companies for life insurance risk assessment. Insurance companies then make their own decision regarding which laboratory to use to supply their collection devices and testing services. We sell our OraSure® Western blot confirmatory test directly to insurance testing laboratories for use in confirming oral fluid specimens collected with our OraSure® device that initially test positive for HIV-1. 
 There exists a wide range of policy limits where our OraSure® product is being used. In general, many (but not all) of our insurance company customers use the OraSure® device in connection with life insurance policies having face amounts of up to $250,000, with some customers using the device for policies of up to $500,000 in amount. Some insurance companies have chosen to extend their testing to lower policy limits where they did not test at all before, while others have used OraSure® to replace some of their blood and urine-based testing. In recent years, some insurance customers have adopted a “Simplified Issues” policy, where lab testing is no longer required and instead the applicant completes a questionnaire about personal behaviors. 
 We also sell our AUTO-LYTE® assays and reagents in the insurance testing market directly to certain laboratories. 
 Significant Products and Customers 
 Several different products have contributed significantly to our financial performance, accounting for 10% or more of our total revenues during the past three years. The table below shows a breakdown of those product revenues (dollars in thousands). 

 | For the years ended December 31, | 
---------------------+----------------------------------+-------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016
Oragene® | $ | 75,850 | | $ | 69,184 | | $ | 29,454
OraQuick® HIV | | 41,457 | | | 35,148 | | | 33,067
OraQuick® HCV | | 12,394 | | | 25,409 | | | 14,066
Cryosurgical systems | | 10,767 | | | 12,279 | | | 13,234

 
One of our customers accounted for approximately 24% and 25% of our net consolidated revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Another customer accounted for approximately 15% of our net consolidated revenues in 2016.

Supply and Manufacturing 
 Our OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV test, OraQuick® In-Home HIV test, OraQuick® HCV test, OraQuick® Ebola test, OraSure®, Intercept® and Intercept i2® collection devices, AUTOLYTE and MICRO-PLATE assays and QED® saliva alcohol test are all manufactured in our Bethlehem, Pennsylvania facilities. We expect to continue to manufacture these products at this location for the foreseeable future. 
 We have contracted with a third party in Thailand for the assembly of the OraQuick® HIV device and the OraQuick® HIV Self-Test in order to supply certain international markets. This supply agreement had an initial term of one year, and automatically renews for additional annual periods unless either party provides a timely notice of termination prior to the end of an annual period. We believe that other firms would be able to assemble these OraQuick® tests on terms no less favorable than those set forth in the agreement if the Thailand contractor would be unable or unwilling to continue assembling this product. 
 We can purchase the HIV antigens, the nitrocellulose and certain other critical components, and the HCV and Ebola antigens used in our OraQuick® product lines only from a limited number of sources. If for any reason these suppliers are unwilling or no longer able to supply our antigen or nitrocellulose needs, we believe that alternative supplies could be obtained at a competitive cost. However, a change in any of the antigens, the nitrocellulose or other critical components used in our products would require FDA approval and some additional development work. This in turn could require significant time to complete, increase our costs and disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell the affected products. 
 Our MICROPLATE and AUTO-LYTE assays require the production of highly specific and sensitive antibodies corresponding to the antigen of interest. Substantially all our antibody requirements are provided by contract suppliers. We believe that we have adequate reserves of antibody supplies and that we have access to sufficient raw materials for these products. 
 Our OraSure QuickFlu® test is manufactured and supplied by a third party, Princeton BioMeditech. There is no other supply source for this product. 
 The fully-automated high-throughput oral fluid drug assays sold with our new Intercept i2® collection device are manufactured and supplied under a long-term agreement with Thermo Fisher. There is no other supply source for these products. 
 The Histofreezer® product and our OTC cryosurgical products are assembled by a U.S. vendor with certain components sourced from international suppliers. We believe that additional suppliers for our cryosurgical products are available on terms no less favorable than the terms of our existing supply agreements in the event that our current suppliers would be unable or unwilling to continue supplying components and manufacturing finished products. 
 DNAG has two long-term contract manufacturing relationships to supply virtually all of its products, including the Oragene® product line. Many of the raw materials and components used in these products are also purchased from third parties, including one critical component that is purchased from a sole source supplier. We believe there are other suppliers that can manufacture and supply the raw materials and components for the DNAG products. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 398 full-time employees (including 146 employees at our subsidiary, DNAG). Of this total, there were 128 in sales, marketing and client services; 50 in research and development; 149 in operations, manufacturing, quality control, information systems, purchasing and shipping; 37 in quality assurance and regulatory affairs; and 35 in administration and finance. This compares to 377 employees as of December 31, 2017. Our employees are not currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Competition 
 The diagnostic industry is a multi-billion dollar international industry and is intensely competitive. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, and have greater financial, research, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. 
 The primary competitive factors for our products include price, quality, performance, ease of use, customer service and reputation. Industry competition is based on these and the following additional factors: 
  
• | Scientific and technological capability;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Proprietary know-how;
--+----------------------


• | The ability to develop and market products and processes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 14


 
• | The ability to obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | The ability to manufacture products that meet applicable FDA or other applicable regulatory requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercial execution and strength of distribution;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | Access to adequate capital;
--+----------------------------


• | The ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | The availability of patent protection.
--+---------------------------------------

 A few large corporations produce a wide variety of diagnostic tests and other medical devices and equipment. A larger number of mid-size companies generally compete only in the diagnostic industry and a significant number of small companies produce only a few diagnostic products. As a result, the diagnostic test industry is highly fragmented and segmented. 
 The future market for diagnostic products is expected to be characterized by greater cost consciousness, the development of new technologies, tighter reimbursement policies and consolidation. The purchasers of diagnostic products are expected to place increased emphasis on lowering costs, reducing inventory levels, obtaining better performing products, automation, service and volume discounts. The increased complexity of the market is expected to force many competitors to enter into joint ventures or license certain products or technologies. 
 We expect competition to intensify as technological advances are made and become more widely known, and as new products reach the market. Furthermore, new testing methodologies could be developed in the future that render our products impractical, uneconomical or obsolete. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that would render our technologies and products obsolete or otherwise commercially unattractive. In addition, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for these products, or introduce or commercialize them, before we can do so. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Several companies market or have announced plans to market oral specimen collection devices and tests both within and outside the United States. We expect the number of devices competing with our OraQuick®, OraSure®, Intercept® and Intercept i2® devices to increase as the benefits of oral fluid-based testing become more widely accepted. 
 Competition in the U.S. market for infectious disease testing in medical settings is intense and is expected to increase. Our principal competition for HIV testing in the professional market comes from existing and new point-of-care rapid blood tests, automated laboratory-based blood tests, or other oral fluid-based tests. One of our competitors has received FDA approval and a CLIA waiver for a rapid oral fluid HIV test and another sells a rapid HIV antigen/antibody test that is both FDA approved and CLIA waived. Our OraQuick® rapid HCV test competes against laboratory-based blood tests in the U.S., as there currently are no other rapid HCV testing products approved by the FDA. 
 Our competitors in the domestic infectious disease testing market include medical diagnostic companies and specialized biotechnology firms, as well as pharmaceutical companies with biotechnology divisions. Competing tests are often sold at a lower price than we charge for our products. This competition can result in lost sales and degradation of the price (and therefore the applicable profit margins) we can charge for our HIV and HCV tests. 
 Outside the U.S., our rapid HIV and HCV tests compete against other rapid and laboratory-based tests. Significant sales of these products in Europe have not materialized principally because of differences in European healthcare systems compared to U.S. systems. Unlike the U.S., adoption of rapid point-of-care diagnostics is not widespread in Europe because laboratory testing is entrenched and healthcare systems are structured around centralized testing models. In addition, many competing tests in international markets are sold at very low prices. We intend to continue to build awareness and develop strategies to expand sales of our OraQuick® HIV and HCV tests in European and other international markets. 
 Our OraQuick® In-Home HIV oral fluid test is the only rapid HIV test approved by the FDA for sale in the U.S. OTC market. We compete against one other non-rapid HIV blood test available in the OTC market, which requires consumers to self-collect a blood sample and then send it to a laboratory for testing. The OraQuick® HIV Self-Test that we sell in certain international markets is expected to face competition from other blood-based rapid HIV self-tests. 
 Competition for our OraQuick® Ebola test includes government and commercially-developed laboratory and point-of-care molecular tests, along with a small number of rapid antigen tests sold under an FDA EUA. Our Ebola test is the only product with regulatory authorization for use on both whole blood samples from living patients and oral fluid samples from cadavers. 
 15


The OraSure QuickFlu® test competes primarily against other rapid flu tests sold by various third parties in the U.S. hospital and public health markets. 
 Our Oragene® collection system competes against other types of collection devices used for molecular testing, such as blood collection devices and buccal swabs, which often are sold for prices lower than the prices charged for the Oragene® products. Although we believe the Oragene® device offers a number of advantages over these other products, the availability of lower price competitive devices can result in lost sales and degradation in pricing and profit margin. Our Oragene® product is also facing increasing competition from similarly designed collection systems which are beginning to enter the market. 
 OMNIgene® • GUT is being sold in the emerging microbiome market and competes with a variety of non-standard in-house solutions developed by various researchers, including simply freezing the sample after collection. The microbiome market is expected to require standardization in the methods used for collection and stabilization in order to derive more accurate and repeatable results. To date, DNAG is one of the few vendors to offer a solution that fully meets these requirements. 
 The OMNIgene® • SPUTUM product is unique and has no direct competition in terms of a comparable product. The primary competition for this product is the incumbent methodologies that are widely adopted for collecting sputum samples and have been used in labs globally for many years. 
 In the substance abuse testing market, our Intercept® drug testing system competes with laboratory-based drug testing products using sample matrices such as urine, hair, sweat and oral fluid. We expect competition for our products to intensify, particularly from other domestic and international companies that have developed, or may develop, competing oral fluid drug testing products. 
 There are at least two competitors that sell fully-automated high-throughput oral fluid drug testing products in unregulated settings in the United States. These competitors sell these assays for use with either their own oral fluid collector or a collector manufactured by another party. These offerings compete against our Intercept® and Intercept i2® collection devices and related oral fluid assays. 
 Our MICRO-PLATE oral fluid drug assays, which are sold for use with the original Intercept® collector and our OraSure® collection device, also continue to come under increasing competitive pressure from “home-brew” assays developed internally by our laboratory customers. Our oral fluid MICRO-PLATE assays also compete with urine-based homogeneous assays that are run on fully-automated, random access analyzers. These tests provide strong competitive pressure because they provide the benefits of automation, including lower costs and short turn-around times. 
 Our MICRO-PLATE drugs-of-abuse reagents sold in the forensic toxicology market are targeted to forensic testing laboratories where sensitivity, automation and “system solutions” are important. In the past, these laboratories have typically had to rely on radioimmunoassay test methods to provide an adequate level of sensitivity. Radioimmunoassays require radioactive materials, which have a short shelf-life and disposal problems. Our MICRO-PLATE tests meet the laboratories’ sensitivity needs, run on automated equipment, are not radioimmunoassays, and are offered to the laboratory as a complete system solution of reagents, instrumentation and software to meet the specific needs of each customer. We compete with both homogeneous and heterogeneous tests manufactured by many companies. 
 Sales of our AUTO-LYTE® urine assays have declined substantially over a number of years, primarily due to competition from “home-brew” assays developed internally by our laboratory customers, which can be produced at a cost lower than the price typically paid for our products. Many of our customers no longer purchase our AUTO-LYTE® assays, and we may eventually stop selling this product line. 
 Q.E.D.® competes against other semi-quantitative saliva-based alcohol tests that have received U.S. Department of Transportation approval as well as breath alcohol tests. Although there are lower priced tests on the market that use oral fluid or breath as a test medium, these tests are qualitative tests that are believed to be substantially lower in quality and provide fewer benefits than our Q.E.D.® test. 
 Our professional cryosurgical product is sold primarily to physicians, including family practitioners, pediatricians and podiatrists. This product primarily competes against other portable cryosurgical systems used for the removal of benign skin lesions in both the U.S. and Europe. In addition, certain of our distributors sell private label cryosurgical products that compete with our Histofreezer® product. Our OTC cryosurgical products compete against other cryosurgical products offered in the U.S. OTC market and certain international OTC markets. 
 Patents and Proprietary Information 
 We seek patents and other intellectual property rights to protect and preserve our proprietary technology and our right to capitalize on the results of our research and development activities. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations 
 16


and licensing opportunities to provide competitive advantages for our products in our markets and to accelerate new product introductions. We regularly search for third-party patents in fields related to our business to shape our own patent and product commercialization strategies as effectively as possible and to identify licensing opportunities. United States patents generally have a maximum term of 20 years from the date an application is filed. 
 We have four United States patents and numerous foreign patents for the OraSure® and Intercept® collection devices and technology relating to oral fluid collection, containers for oral fluids, methods to test oral fluid, formulations for the manufacture of synthetic oral fluid, and methods to control the volume of oral fluid collected and dispersed. The U.S. patents expire from November 2021 to December 2026. We have also applied for additional patents, in both the United States and certain foreign countries, on such products and technology. 
 We have five United States patents for our OraQuick® platform, as well as corresponding related international patents. We also have patent applications pending internationally. Four of the U.S. patents expire from March to July 2019 and the fifth in July 2028. 
 We hold, through our subsidiary, DNAG, eighteen United States patents and numerous foreign patents issued for compositions, methods and apparatuses for the collection, stabilization, transportation and storage of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) from oral fluid and other bodily fluids and tissues. These patents expire from July 2019 through March 2034. 
 We have three United States patents and numerous foreign patents issued for apparatuses and methods for the topical removal of skin lesions relating to our cryosurgical wart removal products, and we have pending patent applications related to these products in the United States and in certain foreign countries. These patents expire from September 2025 to February 2032. 
 We require our employees, consultants, outside collaborators and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed by or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and certain consultants, the agreements also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual during his or her tenure with us or the performance by the consultant of services for us will be our exclusive property. 
 We own rights to trademarks and service marks that we believe are necessary to conduct our business as currently operated. In the United States, we own a number of trademarks, including the OraSure®, Intercept®, Intercept i2®, OraQuick®, OraQuick ADVANCE?, Histofreezer®, OraSure QuickFlu®, Q.E.D.®, Oragene®, ORAcollect®, OMNIgene® and AUTO-LYTE® trademarks. We also own many of these marks and others in several foreign countries. With respect to our international OTC cryosurgical products, the Scholl and Dr. Scholl tradenames are owned by Reckitt Benckiser in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and other countries outside North and South America, and the POINTTS tradename is owned by Genomma. 
 Although important, the issuance of a patent or existence of trademark or trade secret protection does not in itself ensure the success of our business. Competitors may be able to produce products competing with our patented products without infringing our patent rights. Issuance of a patent in one country generally does not prevent manufacture or sale of the patented product in other countries. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to validity or as to the enforceable scope of the patent. The validity or enforceability of a patent or trademark can be challenged by litigation after its issuance or registration. If the outcome of such litigation is adverse to the owner of the patent, the owner’s rights could be diminished or withdrawn. Trade secret protection does not prevent independent discovery and exploitation of the secret product or technique. 
 Government Regulation 
 General 
 Most of our products are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, along with other federal, state and local agencies and comparable regulatory bodies in other countries. This regulated environment governs almost all aspects of development, production and marketing, including product design and testing, authorizations to market, labeling, advertising and promotion, manufacturing, distribution, post-market surveillance and reporting, and recordkeeping. We believe that our products and procedures are in material compliance with all applicable regulations, but the regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products may be unclear and are subject to change. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that these changes might have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Many of our FDA-regulated products require some form of review and action by the FDA before they can be marketed in the United States. After approval or clearance by the FDA, we must continue to comply with other FDA requirements applicable to marketed products and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Both before and after approval or clearance, 
 17


failure to comply with the FDA’s requirements can lead to significant penalties or could disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell these products. In addition, the FDA could refuse permission to obtain certificates needed to export our products if the agency determines that we are not in compliance. 
 Domestic Regulation 
 Most of our products are regulated in the United States as in vitro diagnostic and medical devices. 
 There are several mechanisms by which regulated devices can be placed on the market in the United States. Some products may qualify for clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. To obtain this clearance from the FDA, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification that it intends to begin marketing the product, and show that the product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed predicate device (i.e., a device that has been cleared through the 510(k) process; a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976; a device that has been downclassified by the FDA; or a device that FDA has previously determined to be exempt from the 510(k) process). To be substantially equivalent, an applicant must show that when compared to a predicate, the new device has the same intended use and same technology, or if different technology, that the new device is as safe and effective as the predicate and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. In all cases, data from some form of performance testing is required and in some cases, the submission must include data from human clinical studies. An applicant must submit a 510(k) application at least 90 days before commercial distribution of the affected product commences.  Marketing may only commence when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding that the new device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device. The standards and data requirements necessary for the clearance of a new device may be unclear or may be subject to change. Although FDA clearance usually takes from four to twelve months, in some cases more than a year may be required before clearance is obtained, if at all. 
 If the device does not qualify for the 510(k) procedure, either because there is no existing predicate device, it is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device or because it is classified by the FDA as a high risk device, the FDA must approve either a request for de novo classification or a premarket approval application, or PMA, before marketing can begin. A de novo classification is an alternate pathway to classify novel devices of low to moderate risk for which no substantially equivalent predicate device exists. Clearance of a de novo request generally takes 15 months from the time of submission of the de novo request, although it can take longer. PMAs are generally required for devices that are determined to be high risk and must demonstrate, among other matters, that the medical device provides a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the intended use(s) of the device. A PMA is typically a complex submission, supported by valid scientific evidence, including the results of preclinical and clinical studies, usability data, detailed information about the manufacturing process for the device, and other data and information. Preparing a PMA is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. Once a PMA has been submitted, the FDA is required to review the submission within 180 days. However, the FDA’s review may be, and often is, much longer, in many cases requiring one to three years or more, and may include requests for additional data, review by an independent panel of experts, and facility inspections before approval is granted, if at all. 
 If the FDA approves the PMA, it may place restrictions on the device. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or the manufacturing facility is not favorable, the FDA may deny approval of the PMA application or issue a “not approvable” letter. The FDA may also require additional clinical trials, which can delay the PMA approval process by several years or prevent a PMA approval from being obtained. 
 If the FDA discovers that an applicant has submitted false or misleading information in any application or notification, the FDA may take action against the applicant and its employees or refuse to review submissions until certain requirements are met pursuant to its Application Integrity Policy (AIP). Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such clearances or approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If there are any modifications made to our marketed devices, a new premarket notification or PMA supplement may be required to be submitted to, and cleared or approved by, the FDA, before the modified device may be marketed. A new PMA or a PMA supplement is required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s intended use(s), manufacturing process, manufacturing facility, critical components, labeling and design. Likewise, a new 510(k) clearance is required for any modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, e.g. a significant change or modification in design, material, chemical composition, energy source, or manufacturing process or a major change or modification in the intended use(s) of the device. 
 A clinical trial may be required in support of a 510(k) submission and generally is required for a de novo or PMA application. These trials generally require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the proposed study is deemed to be exempt from the IDE requirements. In addition, if a study meets the 
 18


requirements for a non-significant risk study, it may be eligible for compliance with “abbreviated” IDE requirements, which include a subset of the requirements applicable to significant risk medical device studies. If a full IDE is required, an IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as laboratory testing results, protocols for the proposed investigation, and other information demonstrating that the device is appropriate for use with humans in a clinical study. Clinical trials may begin if the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites. Submission of an IDE application does not give assurance that the FDA will issue the IDE. If the IDE application is approved, there can be no assurance the FDA will determine that the data derived from the trial(s) support the ultimate approval or clearance of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to and approved by the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan in such a way that may affect its scientific soundness, study indication or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. The trial must also comply with the FDA’s regulations, including the requirement that informed consent be obtained from each subject, and with clinical trial reporting regulations that require submission of information on certain clinical trials to a database maintained by the National Institutes of Health. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance to market the product in the United States. 
 Some of our products are used for research only or other nonclinical or non-diagnostic purposes. Our molecular collection products are sold to many academic and research institutions for research purposes and our drugs-of-abuse products are sold to laboratories and clinics for forensic or other non-medical uses. The FDA does not currently regulate products used for these purposes, although other state and federal regulatory requirements may apply. 
 Another option for marketing a product in the U.S. is through an EUA that is granted by the FDA as a result of the Secretary of Health and Human Services declaring an emergency justifying the authorization of emergency use of certain in vitro diagnostic devices to aid in addressing the emergency. Typically, analytical and clinical studies are completed as required by the FDA. Products are exempt from design controls and other quality requirements in order to expedite development of diagnostic tools to aid in the diagnosis of viral pathogens that have the potential to affect public health. 
 Most devices distributed in the United States must comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulations (“QSRs”), including current good manufacturing practices. These regulations govern the entire lifecycle of a medical device, including design, manufacture, testing, release, packaging, distribution, documentation and purchasing as well as complaint handling, corrective and preventative actions, and internal auditing. In complying with the QSRs, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production, quality, and postmarket surveillance to ensure full compliance. 
 Companies are also subject to other post-market and general requirements, including product listing and establishment regulations, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action, post-market surveillance requests, restrictions imposed on marketed products, promotional standards and requirements for recordkeeping and reporting of certain adverse reactions and malfunctions. Device reporting regulations require that manufacturers report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur. 
 The FDA regularly inspects companies to determine compliance with the QSRs and other post-market requirements. Failure to comply with statutory requirements and the FDA’s regulations can result in an FDA Form 483 (which is issued by the FDA at the conclusion of an inspection when an investigator has observed any conditions that may constitute violations), public warning letters, monetary penalties against a company or its officers and employees, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, injunctions, product recalls, product detentions, refusal to provide export certificates, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. We believe that our facilities and procedures are in material compliance with the FDA’s OSR regulations and other postmarket requirements, but the regulations are subject to change or may be unclear, and we cannot be sure that FDA investigators will agree with our compliance with the FDA’s postmarket requirements. 
 The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, prohibit any facility that conducts laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans from providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or the assessment of, the health of human beings, unless there is in effect for such facility a certificate issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services applicable to the category of examination or procedure performed. Tests may be waived from this regulatory oversight if they meet certain requirements established under CLIA. We consider the applicability of CLIA requirements in the design and development of our products. We have obtained a waiver of the CLIA requirements for our OraQuick ADVANCE® rapid HIV-1/2 antibody test, our OraQuick® HCV rapid antibody test and our Q.E.D.® alcohol saliva test and may seek similar waivers for certain other products. In addition, the supplier of the OraSure Quick-Flu® test has obtained a CLIA waiver for that product. A CLIA waiver allows certain customers to use the waived products that may not have been able to use them without complying with applicable quality control and other requirements. 
 19


Certain of our products may also be affected by state regulations in the United States, which can restrict the use and sale of certain diagnostic products. We are presently working with legislators or regulators in certain of these states in an effort to modify or remove any restrictions affecting our ability to sell products. 
 Advertising and Promotion 
 Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and by other federal and state regulatory and enforcement authorities, including the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and various state attorneys general. Although physicians are permitted to exercise medical judgment to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, we may not promote our products for such “off-label” uses and can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have also been the subject of enforcement actions brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a notice of violation, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. FTC enforcement actions often result in consent decrees that constrain future actions. DOJ prosecutions can result in significant criminal and civil penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If an enforcement action is brought by the FDA or FTC, our reputation could be damaged and sales of our products could be impaired. 
Import and Export Requirements 
 Products for export from the United States are subject to foreign countries’ import requirements and the exporting requirements of the FDA, as applicable. In particular, international sales of medical devices manufactured in the United States that are not approved or cleared by the FDA for use in the United States, or are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. 
 Foreign countries often require, among other things, an FDA certificate for products for export, also called a Certificate for Foreign Government (“CFG”). To obtain this certificate from the FDA, the device manufacturer must apply to the FDA. The FDA certifies that the product has been granted clearance or approval in the United States and that the manufacturing facilities were in compliance with QSR regulations at the time of the last FDA inspection. If the FDA determines that our facilities or procedures do not comply with the QSR regulations, it may refuse to provide such certificates until we resolve the issues to the FDA’s satisfaction. Failure to obtain a CFG could inhibit our ability to export our products to countries that require such certificates. 
 International 
 We are also subject to regulations in foreign countries governing products, human clinical trials and marketing, and may need to obtain approval (or pre-qualification or endorsement) from international public health agencies, such as the World Health Organization, in order to sell products in certain countries. Approval processes vary from country to country, and the length of time required for approval or to obtain other clearances may in some cases be longer than that required for U.S. governmental approvals. We generally pursue approval only in those countries that we believe have a significant market opportunity. 
 The International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies from some 130 countries, established in 1947. The mission of the ISO is to promote the development of standardization and related activities in the world with a view to facilitating the international exchange of goods and services. ISO certification indicates that our quality system complies with standards applicable to activities ranging from initial product design and development through production and distribution. 
 In the European Union (“EU”), products that fall under the scope of the Medical Devices Directive (“MDD”) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Directive (“IVDD”) are not subject to the prior approval of a regulatory authority, but, depending on the class of product, may require prior review by a notified body. Notified bodies are accredited and supervised by national regulatory authorities to conduct conformity assessment procedures of medical devices or other products. Such products must comply with certain essential requirements listed in those directives. ISO certification creates a rebuttable presumption that the product satisfies the applicable requirements. Compliance with these requirements allows us to complete the applicable conformity assessment procedure, involving a notified body where necessary, and to affix the CE mark to our products, without which they may not be placed on the market in the EU. 
 20


In addition, the EU has adopted the EU Medical device Regulation (the “EU MDR”) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the “EU IVDR”), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance.  Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have until May 2020 to meet the requirements of the EU MDR and until May 2022 to meet the EU IVDR.  Compliance with these regulations may be expensive and time-consuming.  Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.
 We have completed the applicable conformity assessment procedures and obtained the right to use the CE mark for the OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 test, the OraQuick® HCV test, our Histofreezer® product line, our OTC cryosurgical removal product and certain of the Oragene® collection kits and OMNIgene® products sold by DNAG. 
 We must also comply with certain registration and licensing requirements as dictated by Health Canada, prior to commencing sales in Canada. We have completed this process for several of our current products and may do so with respect to other products in the future. In addition, Canadian law requires manufacturers of medical devices to have a quality management system that meets various ISO requirements in order to obtain a license to sell their devices in Canada. 
 We have obtained WHO pre-qualification for our OraQuick® HIV Self-Test and OraQuick® HCV test and we will likely seek WHO pre-qualification or endorsement for certain other products sold into international markets. 
 Anti-Kickback and Other Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce: 
  
• | The referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental healthcare programs; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other governmental healthcare programs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our products are or may be purchased by customers that will seek or receive reimbursement under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental healthcare programs. Noncompliance with the federal anti-kickback statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental healthcare programs, and/or restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, as well as civil and criminal penalties, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance can result in civil monetary penalties for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the Federal healthcare programs. 
 Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback laws. A determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties, restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions and significant damage to our reputation. 
 We are also subject to other federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including false claims laws, marketing conduct laws and laws constraining the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, such manufacturers can enter into with physicians, hospitals, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws and regulations are wide ranging and subject to changing interpretation and application. In recent years, there has been greater scrutiny of marketing practices in the medical device industry which has resulted in several government investigations by various government authorities and the introduction and/or passage of federal and state legislation regulating interactions between medical device manufacturers and healthcare professionals and providers and requiring the disclosure by medical device manufacturers of payments to certain healthcare professionals and providers. For example, under the Sunshine Act provisions of the Affordable Care Act, device manufacturers are subject to new federal reporting and disclosure requirements with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Reports submitted under the Sunshine Act are placed in a public database. Device manufacturers are required to submit annual reports by March 31 which cover the prior calendar year. To be in compliance with such disclosure laws, we have implemented necessary systems to accurately track gifts and other payments. 
 21


We have implemented a written Policy on Interactions with Health Care Professionals, which is based on the Code of Conduct for Interactions with Health Care Professionals promulgated by the Advanced Medical Technology Association, or AdvaMed, a leading trade association representing medical device manufacturers. The Policy applies to all employees and is intended to comply with applicable state and federal laws, regulations and government guidance. The Policy addresses interactions related to sales and marketing practices, research and development, product training and education, grants and charitable contributions, support of third-party educational conferences, and consulting arrangements. While we believe that our practices are in compliance with the Anti-Kickback and other fraud and abuse laws, the standards for compliance with such statutes can be unclear and subject to change. 
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Other Anti-Corruption Laws 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to use any means of interstate commerce corruptly in the furtherance of any offer, payment, promise to pay or authorization of payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Our present and future business has and will continue to be subject to the FCPA and various other laws, rules and/or regulations applicable to us as a result of our international sales. Those laws include the U.K. Bribery Act (the “Bribery Act”), which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the United Kingdom generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances. 
Environmental Regulation 
 Because of the nature of our current and proposed research, development, and manufacturing processes, we are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge and handling and disposal of solid wastes, hazardous materials and hazardous wastes. Products that we sell in Europe are subject to regulation in European Union, or EU, markets under the Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances Directive, or RoHS. RoHS prohibits companies from selling products which contain certain hazardous materials, including lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers, in EU member states. In addition, the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals Directive also restricts substances of very high concern in products. 
 Future environmental laws may require us to alter our manufacturing processes, thereby increasing our manufacturing costs. We believe that our products and manufacturing processes at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws; however, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated. 
 The foregoing discussion of our business should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 15 of this Annual Report.
