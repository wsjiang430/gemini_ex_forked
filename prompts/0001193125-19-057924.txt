Item 1. Business 
 GENERAL
Dominion Energy, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and incorporated in Virginia in 1983, is one of the nations largest producers and transporters of energy. Dominion Energys strategy is to be a leading sustainable provider of electricity, natural gas and related services to customers primarily in the eastern and Rocky Mountain regions of the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, Dominion Energys portfolio of assets included approximately 26,000 MW of electric generating capacity, 6,700 miles of electric transmission lines, 58,300 miles of electric distribution lines, 14,800 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines and 52,300 miles of gas distribution pipeline, exclusive of service lines. As of December 31, 2018, Dominion Energy served more than 5 million utility and retail energy customers and operated one of the nations largest underground natural gas storage systems, with approximately 1 trillion cubic feet of storage capacity. 
 In January 2019, Dominion Energy completed the SCANA Combination in a stock-for-stock merger valued at $13.4 billion. SCANA is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina and in the distribution of natural gas in North Carolina and South Carolina. In addition, SCANA markets natural gas to retail customers in the southeast U.S. Following the completion of the SCANA Combination, Dominion Energys portfolio of assets includes approximately 32,000 MW of electric generating capacity, 10,200 miles of electric transmission lines, 84,800 miles of electric distribution lines, 15,900 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines and 92,900 miles of gas distribution pipeline, exclusive of service lines. Dominion Energy operates approximately 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity and serves nearly 7.5 million utility and retail energy customers. SCANA operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy. SCANA and one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, SCE&G, are currently SEC registrants. SCANA and SCE&G file a combined Form 10-K, which is not combined herein. 
 Dominion Energy continues to focus on expanding and improving its regulated and long-term contracted electric and natural gas businesses while transitioning to a cleaner energy future. The capital investment program for 2019 through 2023 includes a focus on upgrading the electric grid in Virginia through investments in additional renewable generation facilities, strategic undergrounding, energy conservation programs and smart-grid devices. Renewable generation facilities are expected to include investments in utility-scale solar and offshore wind projects. In addition, Dominion Energy is currently seeking, or intends to seek, license extensions for its regulated nuclear power stations in Virginia. Other drivers for the capital investment program include the construction of infrastructure to handle the increase in natural gas production from the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, including investing in Atlantic Coast Pipeline which is focused on constructing an approximately 600-mile natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina, to increase natural gas supplies in the region. Dominion Energy also plans to upgrade its gas and electric transmission and distribution networks and meet environmental requirements and standards set by various regulatory bodies.

 Dominion Energy has transitioned over the past decade to a more regulated, less volatile earnings mix as evidenced by its capital investments in regulated infrastructure, including the SCANA Combination and Dominion Energy Questar Combination, and in infrastructure whose output is sold under long-term purchase agreements, as well as the sales of certain merchant generating facilities and equity method investments in 2018 and the electric retail energy marketing business in March 2014. Dominion Energy expects approximately 95% of earnings from its primary operating segments to come from regulated and long-term contracted businesses. Dominion Energys nonregulated operations include merchant generation, energy marketing and price risk management activities and natural gas retail energy marketing operations. Dominion Energys operations are conducted through various subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas. 
 Virginia Power, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and incorporated in Virginia in 1909 as a Virginia public service corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy and a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes electricity for sale in Virginia and North Carolina. In Virginia, Virginia Power conducts business under the name Dominion Energy Virginia and primarily serves retail customers. In North Carolina, it conducts business under the name Dominion Energy North Carolina and serves retail customers located in the northeastern region of the state, excluding certain municipalities. In addition, Virginia Power sells and transmits electricity at wholesale prices to rural electric cooperatives, municipalities and into wholesale electricity markets. All of Virginia Powers stock is owned by Dominion Energy. 
 Dominion Energy Gas, a limited liability company formed in September 2013, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy and a holding company. It serves as the intermediate parent company for certain of Dominion Energys regulated natural gas operating subsidiaries, which conduct business activities through a regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline and underground storage system in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest states, regulated gas transportation and distribution operations in Ohio, and gas gathering and processing activities primarily in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Dominion Energy Gas principal wholly-owned subsidiaries are DETI, East Ohio, DGP and Dominion Iroquois. DETI is an interstate natural gas transmission pipeline company serving a broad mix of customers such as local gas distribution companies, marketers, interstate and intrastate pipelines, electric power generators and natural gas producers. The DETI system links to other major pipelines and markets in the mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and Midwest including Dominion Energys Cove Point Pipeline. DETI also operates one of the largest underground natural gas storage systems in the U.S. In August 2016, DETI transferred its gathering and processing facilities to DGP. East Ohio is a regulated natural gas distribution operation serving residential, commercial and industrial gas sales and transportation customers. Its service territory includes Cleveland, Akron, Canton, Youngstown and other eastern and western Ohio communities. At December 31, 2018, Dominion Energy Gas holds a 24.07% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois, a FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipeline in New York and Connecticut. All of Dominion Energy Gas membership interests are owned by Dominion Energy.

Power Delivery 
 The Power Delivery Operating Segment of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power includes Virginia Powers regulated electric transmission and distribution (including customer service) operations, which serve approximately 2.6 million residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers in Virginia and North Carolina. 
 Power Deliverys investment plan includes spending approximately $10.0 billion from 2019 through 2023 to upgrade or add new transmission, including RTEP projects, and distribution lines, substations and other facilities to meet growing electricity demand within its service territory and maintain reliability and regulatory compliance. The proposed electric delivery infrastructure projects are intended to address both continued customer growth and increases in electricity consumption which are partially driven by new and larger data center customers. Additionally, Power Delivery has created a ten-year plan to transform its electric grid into a smarter, stronger and greener grid. This plan will address the structural limitations of Virginia Powers distribution grid in a systematic manner in order to recognize and accommodate fundamental changes and requirements in the energy industry. The objective is to address both customer and system needs by (i) achieving even higher levels of reliability and resiliency against natural and man-made threats, (ii) leveraging technology to enhance the customer experience and improve the 




11



 

  operation of the system and (iii) safely and effectively integrating new utility-scale renewable generation and storage as well as customerlevel distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar and battery storage.
 Revenue provided by electric distribution operations is based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state law. Approximately 85% of revenue comes from serving Virginia jurisdictional customers. Variability in earnings is driven primarily by changes in rates, weather, customer growth and other factors impacting consumption such as the economy and energy conservation, in addition to operating and maintenance expenditures. Operationally, electric distribution continues to focus on improving service levels while striving to reduce costs and link investments to operational results. SAIDI performance results, excluding major events, were 134 minutes for the three- year average ending 2018, up from the previous three-year average of 125 minutes primarily due to increased storm activity during the year. In the future, safety, electric service reliability, outage durations and customer service will remain key focus areas for electric distribution. 
 Revenue provided by Virginia Powers electric transmission operations is based primarily on rates approved by FERC. The profitability of this business is dependent on its ability, through the rates it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings primarily results from changes in rates and the timing of property additions, retirements and depreciation. 
 Virginia Power is a member of PJM, an RTO, and its electric transmission facilities are integrated into PJM wholesale electricity markets. Consistent with the increased authority given to NERC by EPACT, Virginia Powers electric transmission operations are committed to meeting NERC standards, modernizing its infrastructure and maintaining superior system reliability. Virginia Powers electric transmission operations will continue to focus on safety, operational performance, NERC compliance and execution of PJMs RTEP. 
 COMPETITION
There is no competition for electric distribution service within Virginia Powers service territory in Virginia and North Carolina and no such competition is currently permitted. Historically, since its electric transmission facilities are integrated into PJM and electric transmission services are administered by PJM, there was no competition in relation to transmission service provided to customers within the PJM region. However, competition from non-incumbent PJM transmission owners for development, construction and ownership of certain transmission facilities in Virginia Powers service territory is permitted pursuant to Order 1000, subject to state and local siting and permitting approvals. This could result in additional competition to build and own transmission infrastructure in Virginia Powers service area in the future and could allow Dominion Energy to seek opportunities to build and own facilities in other service territories. 
 REGULATION
Virginia Powers electric distribution service, including the rates it may charge to jurisdictional customers, is subject to regulation by the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions. Virginia Powers wholesale electric transmission rates, tariffs and terms of service 

  are subject to regulation by FERC. Electric transmission siting authority remains the jurisdiction of the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions. However, EPACT provides FERC with certain backstop authority for transmission siting. See State Regulations and Federal Regulations in Regulation and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 PROPERTIES
For a description of Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers existing transmission facilities see Item 2. Properties. 
 As a part of PJMs RTEP process, PJM authorized the following material reliability projects (including Virginia Powers estimated cost):

 In addition, in December 2017, the Virginia Commission granted Virginia Power a CPCN to rebuild and operate in Lancaster County, Virginia and Middlesex County, Virginia, approximately 2 miles of existing 115 kV transmission lines to be constructed under the Rappahannock River between Harmony Village Substation and White Stone Substation. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $105 million. 
 Virginia Power is investing in transmission substation physical security and expects to invest an additional $150 million to $200 million through 2023 to strengthen its electrical system to better protect critical equipment, enhance its spare equipment process and create multiple levels of security. 
 For a description of Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers existing distribution facilities see Item 2. Properties. 
 Virginia legislation provides for the recovery of costs, subject to approval by the Virginia Commission, for Virginia Power to move approximately 4,000 miles of electric distribution lines underground. The program is designed to reduce restoration outage time by moving Virginia Powers most outage-prone overhead distribution lines underground, has an annual investment cap of approximately $175 million and is expected to be completed by 2028. The Virginia Commission has approved three phases of the program encompassing approximately 1,100 miles of converted lines and $422 million in capital spending (with $404 million recoverable through Rider U). 
 See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

 SOURCES OF ENERGY SUPPLY
Power Deliverys supply of electricity to serve Virginia Power customers is produced or procured by Power Generation. See Power Generation for additional information. 
 SEASONALITY
Power Deliverys earnings vary seasonally as a result of the impact of changes in temperature, the impact of storms and other catastrophic weather events, and the availability of alternative sources for heating on demand by residential and commercial customers. Generally, the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs, respectively. An increase in heating degree days for Power Deliverys electric utility-related operations does not produce the same increase in revenue as an increase in cooling degree days, due to seasonal pricing differentials and because alternative heating sources are more readily available. 
Power Generation 
 The Power Generation Operating Segment of Virginia Power includes the generation operations of the Virginia Power regulated electric utility and its related energy supply operations. Virginia Powers utility generation operations primarily serve the supply requirements for Power Deliverys utility customers. Virginia Powers non-jurisdictional operations serve certain large-scale customers. 
 The Power Generation Operating Segment of Dominion Energy includes Virginia Powers generation facilities and its related energy supply operations as well as the generation operations of Dominion Energys merchant fleet and energy marketing and price risk management activities for these assets. 
 Power Generations investment plan includes spending approximately $10.3 billion from 2019 through 2023 to maintain existing and construct new generation capacity to meet growing electricity demand within its service territory and maintain reliability. The most significant investments are expanding the renewable generation asset portfolio and the subsequent license renewal projects seeking 20-year license extensions for the regulated nuclear power stations in Virginia. See Properties and Environmental Strategy for additional information on this and other utility projects. 
 In addition, Dominion Energys merchant generation fleet includes numerous renewable generation facilities, including solar generation and wind facilities in operation or development in ten states, including Virginia. The output of these facilities is primarily sold under long-term power purchase agreements with terms generally ranging from 15 to 25 years. See Notes 3 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding certain solar projects. 
 Earnings for the Power Generation Operating Segment of Virginia Power primarily result from the sale of electricity generated by its utility fleet. Revenue is based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state law. Approximately 76% of revenue comes from serving Virginia jurisdictional customers. Base rates for the Virginia jurisdiction are set using a modified cost-of-service rate model, and are generally designed to allow an opportunity to recover the cost of providing utility service and earn a reasonable return on investments used to provide that service. Earnings variability may arise when revenues are impacted by 

  factors not reflected in current rates, such as the impact of weather on customers demand for services. Likewise, earnings may reflect variations in the timing or nature of expenses as compared to those contemplated in current rates, such as labor and benefit costs, capacity expenses, and the timing, duration and costs of scheduled and unscheduled outages. The cost of fuel and purchased power is generally collected through fuel cost-recovery mechanisms established by regulators and does not materially impact net income. The cost of new generation facilities is generally recovered through rate adjustment clauses in Virginia. Variability in earnings from rate adjustment clauses reflects changes in the authorized ROE and the carrying amount of these facilities, which are largely driven by the timing and amount of capital investments, as well as depreciation. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 The Power Generation Operating Segment of Dominion Energy derives its earnings primarily from the sale of electricity generated by Virginia Powers utility and Dominion Energys merchant generation assets, as well as from associated capacity and ancillary services. Variability in earnings provided by Dominion Energys nonrenewable merchant assets relates to changes in market-based prices received for electricity and capacity. Market-based prices for electricity are largely dependent on commodity prices and the demand for electricity. Capacity prices are dependent upon resource requirements in relation to the supply available (both existing and new) in the forward capacity auctions, which are held approximately three years in advance of the associated delivery year. Dominion Energy manages the electric price volatility of its merchant generation fleet by hedging a substantial portion of its expected near-term energy sales with derivative instruments. Variability also results from changes in weather, the cost of fuel consumed, labor and benefits and the timing, duration and costs of scheduled and unscheduled outages. 
 COMPETITION
Power Generation Operating SegmentDominion Energy and Virginia Power 
 Virginia Powers generation operations are not subject to significant competition as only a limited number of its Virginia jurisdictional electric utility customers have retail choice. See Electric under State Regulations in Regulation for more information. Currently, North Carolina does not offer retail choice to electric customers. 
 Virginia Powers non-jurisdictional operations are not currently subject to significant competition as the output from these facilities is primarily sold under long-term power purchase agreements with terms generally ranging from 16 to 25 years. However, in the future, such operations may compete with other power generation facilities to serve certain large-scale customers after the power purchase agreements expire. 
Power Generation Operating SegmentDominion Energy 
 Power Generations renewable generation projects are not currently subject to significant competition as the output from these facilities is primarily sold under long-term power purchase agreements with terms generally ranging from 15 to 25 years. Competition for the merchant fleet is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological 


13



 

  advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. These competitive factors may negatively impact the merchant fleets ability to profit from the sale of electricity and related products and services. 
 Unlike Power Generations regulated generation fleet, its merchant generation fleet is dependent on its ability to operate in a competitive environment and does not have a predetermined rate structure that provides for a rate of return on its capital investments. Power Generations nonrenewable merchant assets operate within functioning RTOs and primarily compete on the basis of price. Competitors include other generating assets bidding to operate within the RTOs. Power Generations nonrenewable merchant units compete in the wholesale market with other generators to sell a variety of products including energy, capacity and ancillary services. It is difficult to compare various types of generation given the wide range of fuels, fuel procurement strategies, efficiencies and operating characteristics of the fleet within any given RTO. However, Dominion Energy applies its expertise in operations, dispatch and risk management to maximize the degree to which its nonrenewable merchant fleet is competitive compared to similar assets within the region. 
 In November 2017, Connecticut adopted the Act Concerning Zero Carbon Solicitation and Procurement, which allows nuclear generating facilities to compete for power purchase agreements in a state sponsored procurement for electricity. In February 2018, Connecticut regulators recommended pursuing the procurement and, in May 2018, issued a request for proposals. Millstone participated in the state sponsored procurement for electricity. In December 2018, Connecticuts Public Utility Regulatory Authority confirmed that Millstone should be considered an existing resource confirmed at risk in the states Department of Energy and Environmental Protection zero carbon procurement. Being considered at risk allows the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to consider factors other than price, such as environmental and economic benefits, when evaluating Dominion Energys bids. Also in December 2018, Millstone was awarded the right to negotiate a ten-year agreement for nine million MWh per year. Dominion Energy continues to engage with applicable parties in Connecticut to ensure pricing that recognizes Millstones environmental and economic benefits.

 SOURCES OF ENERGY SUPPLY
Power Generation Operating SegmentDominion Energy and Virginia Power 
 Power Generation uses a variety of fuels to power its electric generation and purchases power for utility system load requirements and to satisfy physical forward sale requirements, as described below. Some of these agreements have fixed commitments and are included as contractual obligations in Future Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures in Item 7. MD&A. 
 Nuclear FuelPower Generation primarily utilizes long-term contracts to support its nuclear fuel requirements. Worldwide market conditions are continuously evaluated to ensure a range of supply options at reasonable prices which are dependent on the market environment. Current agreements, inventories and spot market availability are expected to support current and planned fuel supply needs. Additional fuel is purchased as required to ensure optimal cost and inventory levels. 
 Fossil FuelPower Generation primarily utilizes natural gas and coal in its fossil fuel plants. All recent fossil fuel plant construction for Power Generation involves natural gas generation. 
 Power Generations natural gas and oil supply is obtained from various sources including purchases from major and independent producers in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions, purchases from local producers in the Appalachian area and Marcellus and Utica regions, purchases from gas marketers and withdrawals from underground storage fields owned by Dominion Energy or third parties. Power Generation manages a portfolio of natural gas transportation contracts (capacity) that provides for reliable natural gas deliveries to its gas turbine fleet, while minimizing costs. 
 Power Generations coal supply is obtained through long-term contracts and short-term spot agreements from domestic suppliers. 
 BiomassPower Generations biomass supply is obtained through long-term contracts and short-term spot agreements from local suppliers. 
 Purchased PowerPower Generation purchases electricity from the PJM spot market and through power purchase agree-

 SEASONALITY
Power Generation Operating SegmentDominion Energy and Virginia Power 
 Sales of electricity for Power Generation typically vary seasonally as a result of the impact of changes in temperature and the availability of alternative sources for heating on demand by residential and commercial customers. See Power Delivery-Seasonality above for additional considerations that also apply to Power Generation. 
 NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Power Generation Operating SegmentDominion Energy and Virginia Power 
 Virginia Power has a total of four licensed, operating nuclear reactors at Surry and North Anna in Virginia. 
 Decommissioning involves the decontamination and removal of radioactive contaminants from a nuclear power station once operations have ceased, in accordance with standards established by the NRC. Amounts collected from ratepayers are placed into trusts and are invested to fund the expected future costs of decommissioning the Surry and North Anna units. 
 Virginia Power believes that the decommissioning funds and their expected earnings for the Surry and North Anna units will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs, particularly when combined with future ratepayer collections and contributions to these decommissioning trusts, if such future collections and contributions are required. This reflects the long-term investment horizon, since the units will not be decommissioned for decades, and a positive long-term outlook for trust fund investment returns. Virginia Power will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC minimum financial 

  assurance requirements, which may include, if needed, the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial instruments recognized by the NRC. 
 The estimated cost to decommission Virginia Powers four nuclear units is reflected in the table below and is primarily based upon site-specific studies completed in 2014. These cost studies are generally completed every four to five years. The current cost estimates assume decommissioning activities will begin shortly after cessation of operations, which will occur when the operating licenses expire. 
 Under the current operating licenses, Virginia Power is scheduled to decommission the Surry and North Anna units during the period 2032 to 2078. NRC regulations allow licensees to apply for extension of an operating license in up to 20-year increments. Virginia Power has filed an application with the NRC to renew operating licenses for Surry for an additional 20 years. Under its current licenses, the two nuclear units are allowed to generate electricity through 2032 and 2033. A relicensing would extend their lives through 2052 and 2053. Virginia Power expects to submit a license extension application for the two units at North Anna in 2020. Between the four units, Virginia Power estimates that it could spend approximately $3 billion to $4 billion over the next several years on the relicensing process. The existing regulatory framework in Virginia provides rate recovery mechanisms for such costs. 
 Power Generation Operating SegmentDominion Energy 
 In addition to the four nuclear units discussed above, Dominion Energy has two licensed, operating nuclear reactors at Millstone in Connecticut. A third Millstone unit ceased operations before Dominion Energy acquired the power station. In May 2013, Dominion Energy ceased operations at its single Kewaunee unit in Wisconsin and commenced decommissioning activities using the SAFSTOR methodology. The planned decommissioning completion date is 2073, which is within the NRC allowed 60-year window. 
 As part of Dominion Energys acquisition of both Millstone and Kewaunee, it acquired decommissioning funds for the related units. Any funds remaining in Kewaunees trust after decommissioning is completed are required to be refunded to Wisconsin ratepayers. Dominion Energy believes that the amounts currently available in the decommissioning trusts and their expected earnings will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs for the Millstone and Kewaunee units. Dominion Energy will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC minimum financial assurance requirements, which may include, if needed, the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial instruments recognized by the NRC. The estimated cost to decommission Dominion Energys eight units is reflected in the table below and is primarily based upon site-specific studies completed for Surry, North Anna and Millstone in 2014 and for Kewaunee in 2018.

 Gas Infrastructure 
 The Gas Infrastructure Operating Segment of Dominion Energy Gas includes certain of Dominion Energys regulated natural gas operations. DETI, the gas transmission pipeline and storage business, serves gas distribution businesses and other customers in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest. East Ohio, the primary gas distribution business of Dominion Energy Gas, serves residential, commercial and industrial gas sales, transportation and gathering service customers primarily in Ohio. DGP conducts gas gathering and processing activities, which include the sale of extracted products at market rates, primarily in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Dominion Iroquois holds a 24.07% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois, which provides service to local gas distribution companies, electric utilities and electric power 

  generators, as well as marketers and other end users, through interconnecting pipelines and exchanges primarily in New York. 
 The Gas Infrastructure Operating Segment of Dominion Energy includes Dominion Energy Gas regulated natural gas operations as well as LNG operations, Dominion Energy Questar operations, Hopes gas distribution operations in West Virginia, DECGs FERC-regulated interstate natural gas transportation services in South Carolina and southeastern Georgia and nonregulated retail natural gas marketing, as well as Dominion Energys investments in Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Iroquois. See Properties and Investments below for additional information regarding the Atlantic Coast Pipeline investment. Dominion Energys LNG operations involve the import, export and storage of LNG at Cove Point, transportation of regasified LNG to the interstate pipeline grid and mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets and liquefaction of natural gas for export as LNG. 
 In September 2016, Dominion Energy completed the Dominion Energy Questar Combination and Dominion Energy Questar, a Rockies-based integrated natural gas company consisting of Questar Gas, Wexpro and Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy. Questar Gas regulated gas distribution operations serves customers in Utah, southwestern Wyoming and southeastern Idaho. Wexpro develops and produces natural gas from reserves supplied to Questar Gas under a cost-of-service framework. Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline provides FERC-regulated interstate natural gas transportation and storage services in Utah, Wyoming and western Colorado. See Acquisitions and Dispositions above and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Dominion Energy Questar Combination. 
 Gas Infrastructures investment plan includes spending approximately $8.5 billion from 2019 through 2023 to upgrade existing or add new infrastructure to meet growing energy needs within its service territory and maintain reliability. Demand for natural gas is expected to continue to grow as initiatives to transition to gas from more carbon-intensive fuels are implemented. This plan includes Dominion Energys portion of spending for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project. 
 Earnings for the Gas Infrastructure Operating Segment of Dominion Energy Gas primarily result from rates established by FERC and the Ohio Commission. The profitability of this business is dependent on Dominion Energy Gas ability, through the rates it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices and the economy. 
 Approximately 92% of DETIs transmission capacity is subscribed including 86% under long-term contracts (two years or greater) and 6% on a year-to-year basis. DETIs storage services are 100% subscribed with long-term contracts. 
 Revenue from processing and fractionation operations largely results from the sale of commodities at market prices. For DGPs processing plants, Dominion Energy Gas receives the wet gas product from producers and may retain the extracted NGLs as compensation for its services. This exposes Dominion Energy Gas to commodity price risk for the value of the spread between the NGL products and natural gas. In addition, Dominion Energy 




16



 

  Gas has volumetric risk as the majority of customers receiving these services are not required to deliver minimum quantities of gas. 
 East Ohio utilizes a straight-fixed-variable rate design for a majority of its customers. Under this rate design, East Ohio recovers a large portion of its fixed operating costs through a flat monthly charge accompanied by a reduced volumetric base delivery rate. Accordingly, East Ohios revenue is less impacted by weather-related fluctuations in natural gas consumption than under the traditional rate design. 
 Earnings for the Gas Infrastructure Operating Segment of Dominion Energy primarily include the results of rates established by FERC and the Ohio, West Virginia, Utah, Wyoming and Idaho Commissions. Additionally, Dominion Energy receives revenue from firm fee-based contractual arrangements, including negotiated rates, for certain LNG storage and terminalling services. The Liquefaction Project has a firm contracted capacity for LNG loading onto ships of approximately 4.6 Mtpa (0.66 Bcfe/day), under normal operating conditions and after accounting for maintenance downtime and other losses. Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline and DECGs revenues are primarily derived from reservation charges for firm transportation and storage services as provided for in their FERC-approved tariffs. Revenue provided by Questar Gas operations is based primarily on rates established by the Utah and Wyoming Commissions. The Idaho Commission has contracted with the Utah Commission for rate oversight of Questar Gas operations in a small area of southeastern Idaho. Hopes gas distribution operations in West Virginia serve residential, commercial, sale for resale and industrial gas sales, transportation and gathering service customers. Revenue provided by Hopes operations is based primarily on rates established by the West Virginia Commission. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on their capital investments. Variability in earnings results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices and the economy. 
 COMPETITION
Gas Infrastructure Operating SegmentDominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas 
 Dominion Energy Gas natural gas transmission operations compete with domestic and Canadian pipeline companies. Dominion Energy Gas also competes with gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services. Alternative fuel sources, such as oil or coal, provide another level of competition. Although competition is based primarily on price, the array of services that can be provided to customers is also an important factor. The combination of capacity rights held on certain long-line pipelines, a large storage capability and the availability of numerous receipt and delivery points along its own pipeline system enable Dominion Energy to tailor its services to meet the needs of individual customers. 
 DGPs processing and fractionation operations face competition in obtaining natural gas supplies for its processing and related 

  services. Numerous factors impact any given customers choice of processing services provider, including the location of the facilities, efficiency and reliability of operations, and the pricing arrangements offered. 
 In Ohio, there has been no legislation enacted to require supplier choice for natural gas distribution consumers. However, East Ohio has offered an Energy Choice program to residential and commercial customers since October 2000. East Ohio has since taken various steps approved by the Ohio Commission toward exiting the merchant function, including restructuring its commodity service and placing Energy Choice-eligible customers in a direct retail relationship with participating suppliers. Further, in April 2013, East Ohio fully exited the merchant function for its nonresidential customers, which are now required to choose a retail supplier or be assigned to one at a monthly variable rate set by the supplier. At December 31, 2018, approximately 1.1 million of East Ohios 1.2 million Ohio customers were participating in the Energy Choice program. 
 Gas Infrastructure Operating SegmentDominion Energy 
 Questar Gas and Hope do not currently face direct competition from other distributors of natural gas for residential and commercial customers in their service territories as state regulations in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho for Questar Gas, and West Virginia for Hope, do not allow customers to choose their provider at this time. See State Regulations in Regulation for additional information. 
 Cove Points gas transportation, LNG import and storage operations, as well as the Liquefaction Projects capacity are contracted primarily under long-term fixed reservation fee agreements. However, in the future Cove Point may compete with other independent terminal operators as well as major oil and gas companies on the basis of terminal location, services provided and price. Competition from terminal operators primarily comes from refiners and distribution companies with marketing and trading arms. In addition, Cove Points Liquefaction Project may face competition on a global scale as international customers explore other options to meet their energy needs. 
 Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline and DECGs pipeline systems generate a substantial portion of their revenue from long-term firm contracts for transportation services and are therefore insulated from competitive factors during the terms of the contracts. When these long-term contracts expire, Dominion Energy Questar Pipelines pipeline system faces competitive pressures from similar facilities that serve the Rocky Mountain region and DECGs pipeline system faces competitive pressures from similar facilities that serve the South Carolina and southeastern Georgia area in terms of location, rates, terms of service, and flexibility and reliability of service. 
 Dominion Energys retail energy marketing operations compete against incumbent utilities and other energy marketers in nonregulated energy markets for natural gas, and provides service to approximately 380,000 customer accounts in five states. The heaviest concentration of customers in these markets is located in states where utilities have the advantage of long-standing commitment to customer choice, primarily Ohio and Pennsylvania.

See State Regulations and Federal Regulations in Regulation for more information. 
 PROPERTIES
For a description of Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas existing facilities see Item 2. Properties.
Gas Infrastructure Operating SegmentDominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas 
 Dominion Energy Gas has the following significant projects under construction or development to better serve customers or expand its service offerings within its service territory. 
 In August 2018, DETI executed a binding precedent agreement with a customer for the West Loop project. The project is expected to cost approximately $95 million and provide 150,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service from Pennsylvania to Ohio for delivery to a proposed combined-cycle, natural gas-fired electric power generation facility to be located in Columbiana County, Ohio. In December 2018, DETI filed an application to request FERC authorization to construct, operate and maintain the project facilities, which are expected to be in service by the end of 2021. 
 In January 2018, DETI filed an application to request FERC authorization to construct and operate certain facilities located in Ohio and Pennsylvania for the Sweden Valley project. The project is expected to cost approximately $50 million and provide 120,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service from Pennsylvania to Ohio for delivery to Transco. The projects capacity is fully subscribed pursuant to a precedent agreement with one customer and is expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
 In December 2014, DETI entered into a precedent agreement with Atlantic Coast Pipeline for the Supply Header project, a project to provide approximately 1,500,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service to various customers. During the third and fourth quarters of 2018, a FERC stop work order together with delays in obtaining permits necessary for construction and delays in construction due to judicial actions impacted the cost and schedule for the project. As a result, project cost estimates have increased from between $550 million to $600 million to between 

  $650 million to $700 million, excluding financing costs. DETI anticipates a late 2020 in-service date. 
 In 2008, East Ohio began PIR, aimed at replacing approximately 4,100 miles of its pipeline system at a cost of $2.7 billion. In 2011, approval was obtained to include an additional 1,450 miles and to increase annual capital investment to meet the program goal. The program will replace approximately 25% of the pipeline system and is anticipated to take place over a total of 25 years. In September 2016, East Ohio received approval to extend the PIR program for an additional five years and to increase its annual capital expenditures to $200 million by 2018 and 3% per year thereafter subject to the cost recovery rate increase caps proposed by East Ohio. Costs associated with calendar year 2016 investment will be recovered under the existing terms. In April 2018, the Ohio Commission approved East Ohios application to adjust the PIR cost recovery rates for 2017 costs. The filing reflects gross plant investment for 2017 of $204 million, cumulative gross plant investment of $1.4 billion and a revenue requirement of $165 million. 
 Gas Infrastructure Operating SegmentDominion Energy 
 Dominion Energy has the following significant projects under construction or development. 
 Cove PointIn June 2015, Cove Point executed binding agreements with two customers for the approximately $150 million Eastern Market Access Project. In January 2018, Cove Point received FERC authorization to construct and operate the project facilities, which are expected to be placed into service in the second half of 2019. In October 2018, Cove Point announced it was evaluating alternatives to a proposed Charles County, Maryland compressor station that was initially part of this project and in December 2018, after working with project customers for alternative solutions, decided not to pursue further construction at this location resulting in a revised project cost estimate of approximately $45 million. 
 Questar GasIn 2010, Questar Gas began replacing aging high pressure infrastructure under a cost-tracking mechanism that allows it to place into rate base and earn a return on capital expenditures associated with a multi-year natural gas infrastructure-replacement program upon the completion of each project. At that time, the commission-allowed annual spending in the replacement program was approximately $55 million. 
 In its 2014 Utah general rate case, Questar Gas received approval to include intermediate high pressure infrastructure in the replacement program and increase the annual spending limit to approximately $65 million, adjusted annually using a gross domestic product inflation factor. At that time, 420 miles of high pressure pipe and 70 miles of intermediate high pressure pipe were identified to be replaced in the program over a 17-year period. Questar Gas has spent about $65 million each year through 2018 under this program. The program is evaluated in each Utah general rate case. The next Utah general rate case is anticipated to occur in 2019. 
 INVESTMENTS
IroquoisIn September 2015, Dominion Energy, through Dominion Energy Midstream, acquired an additional 25.93% interest in Iroquois. Dominion Energy Gas holds a 24.07% interest with TransCanada holding a 50% interest. Iroquois owns and 


18



 

  operates a 416-mile FERC regulated interstate natural gas pipeline providing service to local gas distribution companies, electric utilities and electric power generators, as well as marketers and other end-users, through interconnecting pipelines and exchanges. Iroquois pipeline extends from the U.S.-Canadian border at Waddington, New York through the state of Connecticut to South Commack, Long Island, New York and continuing on from Northport, Long Island, New York through the Long Island Sound to Hunts Point, Bronx, New York. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about Dominion Energys equity method investment in Iroquois. 
 Atlantic Coast PipelineIn September 2014, Dominion Energy, along with Duke and Southern Company Gas, announced the formation of Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline partnership agreement includes provisions to allow Dominion Energy an option to purchase additional ownership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline to maintain a leading ownership percentage. The members hold the following membership interests: Dominion Energy, 48%; Duke, 47%; and Southern Company Gas, 5%. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is focused on constructing an approximately 600-mile natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina. See Future Issues and Other Matters in Item 7 for information on estimated project costs and in-service date and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about Dominion Energys equity method investment in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. 
 Align RNGIn November 2018, Dominion Energy announced the formation of Align RNG, an equal partnership with Smithfield Foods, Inc. Align RNG expects to invest $250 million to develop assets to capture methane from hog farms across Virginia, North Carolina and Utah and convert it into pipeline quality natural gas. 
 SOURCES OF ENERGY SUPPLY
Dominion Energy
 and Dominion Energy Gas natural gas supply is obtained from various sources including purchases from major and independent producers in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions, local producers in the Appalachian area, gas marketers and, for Questar Gas specifically, from Wexpro and other producers in the Rocky Mountain region. Wexpros gas development and production operations serve the majority of Questar Gas gas supply requirements in accordance with the Wexpro Agreement and the Wexpro II Agreement, comprehensive agreements with the states of Utah and Wyoming. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas large underground natural gas storage network and the location of their pipeline systems are a significant link between the countrys major interstate gas pipelines and large markets in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Rocky Mountain regions. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas pipelines are part of an interconnected gas transmission system, which provides access to supplies nationwide for local distribution companies, marketers, power generators and industrial and commercial customers. 
 Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas underground storage facilities play an important part in balancing gas supply with consumer demand and are essential to serving the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions. In addition, 
 storage capacity is an important element in the effective management of both gas supply and pipeline transmission capacity. 

 The supply of gas to serve Dominion Energys retail energy marketing customers is procured through Dominion Energys energy marketing group and market wholesalers. 
 SEASONALITY
Gas Infrastructures natural gas distribution business earnings vary seasonally, as a result of the impact of changes in temperature on demand by residential and commercial customers for gas to meet heating needs. Historically, the majority of these earnings have been generated during the heating season, which is generally from November to March; however, implementation of rate mechanisms in Ohio for East Ohio, and Utah, Wyoming and Idaho for Questar Gas and transportation services provided to gas producers and electric power generators at East Ohio have reduced the earnings impact of weather-related fluctuations. Demand for services at Dominion Energys gas transmission and storage business can also be weather sensitive. Earnings are also impacted by changes in commodity prices driven by seasonal weather changes, the effects of unusual weather events on operations and the economy. 
 The earnings of Dominion Energys retail energy marketing operations also vary seasonally. Generally, the demand for gas peaks during the winter months to meet heating needs. 
 Southeast Energy 
 The Southeast Energy Operating Segment of Dominion Energy, established in January 2019, includes the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity through SCE&G, the distribution of natural gas through SCE&G and PSNC and the marketing of natural gas to retail customers through SEMI. 
 SCE&G is engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to approximately 730,000 customers in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. Additionally, SCE&G and PSNC sell natural gas to approximately 960,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in South Carolina and North Carolina. SEMI markets natural gas and provides energy-related services, selling natural gas to approximately 420,000 customers in the southeast U.S. 
 Southeast Energys investment plan includes spending approximately $4.6 billion from 2019 through 2023 to upgrade or add new equipment and infrastructure in response to increasing customer growth and demand and an effort to maintain reliability for customers. 
 Revenue provided by SCE&Gs electric distribution operations is based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state law. Variability in earnings is driven primarily by changes in rates, weather, customer growth and other factors impacting consumption such as the economy and energy conservation, in addition to operating and maintenance expenditures. 
 SCE&Gs electric transmission operations serve its electric distribution operations as well as certain wholesale customers. Revenue provided by such electric transmission operations is primarily based on a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism under SCE&Gs open access transmission tariff. 
 Revenue provided by SCE&Gs electric generation operations is primarily derived from the sale of electricity generated by its utility generation assets and is based on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state law. Variability in earnings may arise when revenues are impacted by factors not reflected in current rates, such as the impact of weather, or the timing and nature of expenses or outages.

 Revenue provided by SCE&G and PSNCs natural gas distribution operations primarily results from rates established by the South Carolina and North Carolina Commissions, respectively. Variability in earnings results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services, the availability and prices of alternative fuels and the economy. 
 SCE&G is a member of the Virginia-Carolinas Reliability Group, one of several geographic divisions within the SERC Reliability Corporation. The SERC Reliability Corporation is one of seven regional entities with delegated authority from NERC for the purpose of proposing and enforcing reliability standards approved by NERC. 
 COMPETITION
There is no competition for electric distribution or generation service within SCE&Gs service territory in South Carolina and no such competition is currently permitted. However, competition from third-party owners for development, construction and ownership of certain transmission facilities in SCE&Gs service territory is permitted pursuant to Order 1000, subject to state and local siting and permitting approvals. This could result in additional competition to build and own transmission infrastructure in SCE&Gs service area in the future. 
 Competition in Southeast Energys natural gas distribution operations is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and the ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers. 
 Southeast Energys marketing services for natural gas and other energy-related services face competition from affiliates of large energy companies and electric membership cooperatives, among others. The ability of Southeast Energy to maintain its market share primarily depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors and its ability to provide high levels of customer service. 
 REGULATION
SCE&Gs electric distribution service, including the rates it may charge to jurisdictional customers, is subject to regulation by the South Carolina Commission. SCE&Gs electric generation operations are subject to regulation by the South Carolina Commission, FERC, the NRC, the EPA, the DOE and various other federal, state and local authorities. SCE&Gs electric transmission service is primarily regulated by FERC and the DOE. SCE&G and PSNCs gas distribution operations are subject to regulation by the South Carolina and North Carolina Commissions, respectively, as well as PHMSA, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and the North Carolina Commission for enforcement of federal and state pipeline safety requirements in their respective service territories. SEMIs energy marketing activities are subject to regulation by the Georgia Public Service Commission as to retail prices for customers served under regulated provider contracts and FERC. 

  See State Regulations and Federal Regulations in Regulation for more information. 
 PROPERTIES
For a listing of existing property and facilities associated with Southeast Energy at January 1, 2019, see Item 2. Properties. 
 The following material reliability projects are currently under construction or development at SCE&G: 
 In response to revised Effluent Limitations Guidelines mandated by the EPA, SCE&G intends to upgrade the wastewater discharge filtration systems at the Williams and Wateree coal-fired generation facilities. The scope and scheduling of these projects is dependent on the finalization of the Effluent Limitations Guidelines, but is expected to cost approximately $250 million and be placed into service by the end of 2025. 
 In an effort to maintain the reliability and safety of the baghouse at its Cope coal-fired generation facility, SCE&G is currently replacing the existing carbon steel baghouse structure with a corrosion resistant material to address corrosion issues resulting from the dry scrubber system. The project is estimated to cost approximately $40 million and be placed into service by the end of 2020. 
 The following material reliability projects are currently under construction or development at PSNC: 
 PSNC plans to construct approximately 38 miles of transmission pipeline between Franklinton, North Carolina and Clayton, North Carolina, which will improve system reliability and provide the capacity necessary to support the growing natural gas demand in PSNCs service territory. The project is expected to cost approximately $130 million and provide approximately 170,000 Dths per day. The project is expected to be placed into service in 2020. 
 PSNC is constructing a high-pressure distribution pipeline that will ultimately span 35 miles between Forest City, North Carolina and Marion, North Carolina, which will provide enhanced system reliability and safety. The project is expected to cost approximately $60 million and provide approximately 60,000 Dths per day. The project is expected to be placed into service in late 2019. 
 SOURCES OF ENERGY SUPPLY
Southeast Energy uses a variety of fuels to power its electric generation and purchases power for utility system load requirements. Presented below is a summary of SCANAs actual system output by energy source : 

Source | 2018 | 
Natural gas | | 37 | %
Coal | | 35 | 
Nuclear(1) | | 20 | 
Other(2) | | 8 | 
Total | | 100 | %


(1) | Excludes Santee Coopers 33.3% undivided ownership interest in Summer.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Includes hydro, biomass and solar.
----+-----------------------------------

 Natural gasSCE&G purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers on both a short-term and long-term basis at market-based prices. The gas is delivered to South Carolina through firm transportation agreements with various 




20



 

  counterparties, which expire between 2019 and 2084. PSNC purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers on a short-term basis at market-based prices and on a long-term basis for reliability assurance at first of the month index prices plus a reservation charge in certain cases. The gas is delivered to North Carolina through transportation agreements with Transco, which expire at various dates through 2031. 
 CoalSoutheast Energy primarily obtains coal through short-term and long-term contracts with suppliers located in eastern Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. These contracts provide for approximately 2.1 million tons annually. These contracts expire at various times through 2020. Spot market purchases may occur when needed or when prices are believed to be favorable. 
 NuclearSoutheast Energy primarily utilizes long-term contracts to support its nuclear fuel requirements. SCE&G, for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, and Westinghouse are parties to a fuel alliance agreement and contracts for fuel fabrication and related services. Under these contracts, SCE&G supplies enriched products to Westinghouse, who in turn supplies nuclear fuel assemblies for Summer. Westinghouse is SCE&Gs exclusive provider of such fuel assemblies on a cost-plus basis. The fuel assemblies to be delivered under the contracts are expected to supply the nuclear fuel requirements through 2033. 
 In addition, SCE&G has contracts covering its nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services and enrichment services. These contracts have varying expiration dates through 2024. SCE&G believes that it will be able to renew these contracts as they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services and that sufficient capacity for nuclear fuel supplies and processing exists to allow for normal operations of its nuclear generating unit. Current agreements, inventories and spot market availability are expected to support current and planned fuel supply needs. Additional fuel is purchased as required to ensure optimal fuel and inventory levels. 
 SEASONALITY
Southeast Energys electric operations vary seasonally as a result of the impact of changes in temperature, the impact of storms and other catastrophic weather events and the availability of alternative sources for heating on demand by residential and commercial customers. Generally, the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs. An increase in heating degree days does not produce the same increase in revenue as an increase in cooling degree days, due to seasonal pricing differentials and because alternative heating sources are more readily available. 
 Southeast Energys gas operations vary seasonally as a result of the impact of changes in temperature on demand by residential and commercial customers for gas to meet heating needs. The majority of these earnings are generated during the heating season, which is generally from November to March; however, North Carolina and South Carolina have certain mechanisms designed to reduce the impact of weather-related fluctuations. 
 The earnings of Southeast Energys natural gas marketing operations also vary seasonally, and generally peak during the winter months to meet heating needs. 

 NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
SCE&G has a two-thirds interest in one licensed, operating nuclear reactor at Summer in South Carolina. 
 Decommissioning involves the decontamination and removal of radioactive contaminants from a nuclear power station once operations have ceased, in accordance with standards established by the NRC. Amounts collected by ratepayers are placed into trusts and are invested to fund the expected future costs of decommissioning Summer. 
 SCE&G believes that the decommissioning funds and their expected earnings will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs, particularly when combined with future ratepayer collections and contributions to this trust, if such future collections and contributions are required. SCE&G will continue to monitor this trust to ensure that it meets the NRC minimum financial assurance requirements, which may include, if needed, the use of Dominion Energy guarantees, surety bonding or other financial instruments recognized by the NRC. 
 The current estimated cost to SCE&G to decommission Summer is $626 million (stated in 2018 dollars), which is primarily based upon site-specific studies completed in 2016. These cost studies are generally completed every four to five years. Santee Cooper is responsible for the remaining 33.3% of decommissioning costs, proportionate with its ownership in Summer. The current cost estimates assume decommissioning activities will begin shortly after cessation of operations, which will occur when the operating license expires. The cost estimate reflects reductions for the expected future recovery of certain spent nuclear fuel costs based on SCE&Gs contracts with the DOE for disposal of spent nuclear fuel consistent with the reductions reflected in SCANAs nuclear decommissioning ARO. Currently, SCE&G has $190 million in a trust for its proportionate share of these decommissioning activities. 
 Under the current operating license, SCE&G is scheduled to decommission Summer in 2042. NRC regulations allow licensees to apply for extension of an operating license in up to 20-year increments. SCE&G is considering an operating license renewal for Summer. 
 Corporate and Other 
 Corporate and Other Segment-Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas 
 Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas Corporate and Other segments primarily include certain specific items attributable to their operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments performance or in allocating resources. 
 Corporate and Other Segment-Dominion Energy 
 Dominion Energys Corporate and Other segment includes its corporate, service company and other functions (including unallocated debt). In addition, Corporate and Other includes specific items attributable to Dominion Energys operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments performance or in allocating resources.

REGULATION
The Companies are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including the state commissions of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, West Virginia, Georgia, Utah, Wyoming and Idaho, SEC, FERC, EPA, DOE, NRC, Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
State Regulations 
 ELECTRIC
Virginia Power and SCE&Gs electric utility retail services are subject to regulation by the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions and the South Carolina Commission, respectively. 
 Virginia Power and SCE&G hold CPCNs which authorize them to maintain and operate their electric facilities now in operation and to sell electricity to customers. However, Virginia Power and SCE&G may not construct generating facilities or large capacity transmission lines without the prior approval of various state and federal government agencies. In addition, the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission regulate Virginia Powers and the South Carolina Commission regulates SCE&Gs transactions with affiliates and transfers of certain facilities. The Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina Commissions also regulate the issuance of certain securities. 
Electric Regulation in Virginia 
 The Regulation Act instituted a cost-of-service rate model, ending Virginias planned transition to retail competition for electric supply service to most classes of customers. 
 The Regulation Act authorizes stand-alone rate adjustment clauses for recovery of costs for new generation projects, including pumped hydroelectricity generation and storage facilities as well as extensions of operating licenses of nuclear power generation facilities, FERC-approved transmission costs, underground distribution lines, environmental compliance, conservation and energy efficiency programs and renewable energy programs, and also contains statutory provisions directing Virginia Power to file annual fuel cost recovery cases with the Virginia Commission. As amended, it provides for enhanced returns on capital expenditures on specific newly-proposed generation projects. 
 In March 2018, the GTSA reinstated base rate reviews on a triennial basis other than the first review, which will be a quadrennial review, occurring for Virginia Power in 2021 for the four successive 12-month test periods beginning January 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2020. This review for Virginia Power will occur one year earlier than under the Regulation Act legislation enacted in February 2015. 
 In the triennial review proceedings, earnings that are more than 70 basis points above the utilitys authorized return on equity that might have been refunded to customers and served as the basis for a reduction in future rates, may be reduced by approved investment amounts in qualifying solar or wind generation facilities or electric distribution grid transformation projects that Virginia Power elects to include in a customer credit reinvestment offset. The legislation declares that electric distribution grid transformation projects are in the public interest and provides that the costs of such projects may be recovered through a rate adjustment clause if not the subject of a customer credit reinvestment offset. Any costs that are the subject of a customer credit reinvestment offset may not be recovered in base 

  rates for the service life of the projects and may not be included in base rates in future triennial review proceedings. In any triennial review in which the Virginia Commission determines that the utilitys earnings are more than 70 basis points above its authorized return on equity, base rates are subject to reduction prospectively and customer refunds would be due unless the total customer credit reinvestment offset elected by the utility equals or exceeds the amount of earnings in excess of the 70 basis points. In the 2021 review, any such rate reduction is limited to $50 million. 
 The legislation also included provisions requiring Virginia Power to provide current customers one-time rate credits totaling $200 million and to reduce base rates to reflect reductions in income tax expense resulting from the 2017 Tax Reform Act. In addition, Virginia Power reduced base rates on an annual basis by $125 million effective July 2018, to reflect the estimated effect of the 2017 Tax Reform Act, which is subject to adjustment effective April 2019. In May and June 2018, Virginia Power submitted filings detailing the implementation plan for interim reductions in rates for generation and distribution services pursuant to the GTSA. 
 If the Virginia Commissions future rate decisions, including actions relating to Virginia Powers rate adjustment clause filings, differ materially from Virginia Powers expectations, it may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 See Futures Issues and Other Matters in Item 7. MD&A and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Electric Regulation in North Carolina 
 Virginia Powers retail electric base rates in North Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to North Carolina statutes and the rules and procedures of the North Carolina Commission. North Carolina base rates are set by a process that allows Virginia Power to recover its operating costs and an ROIC. If retail electric earnings exceed the authorized ROE established by the North Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the North Carolina Commission, which may decrease Virginia Powers future earnings. Additionally, if the North Carolina Commission does not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, Virginia Powers future earnings could be negatively impacted. Fuel rates are subject to revision under annual fuel cost adjustment proceedings. 
 Virginia Powers transmission service rates in North Carolina are regulated by the North Carolina Commission as part of Virginia Powers bundled retail service to North Carolina customers. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Electric Regulation in South Carolina 
 SCE&Gs retail electric base rates in South Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to South Carolina statutes and the rules and procedures of the South Carolina Commission. South Carolina base rates are set by a process that allows SCE&G to recover its operating costs and an ROIC. If retail electric earnings exceed the authorized ROE established by the South Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may by sub-


22



 

  ject to review and possible reduction, which may decrease SCE&Gs future earnings. Additionally, if the South Carolina Commission does not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, SCE&Gs future earnings could be negatively impacted. Fuel costs are reviewed annually by the South Carolina Commission, as required by statute, and fuel rates are subject to revision in these annual fuel proceedings. 
 SCE&G offers to its retail electric customers several DSM programs designed to assist customers in reducing their demand for electricity and improving their energy efficiency. SCE&G submits annual filings to the South Carolina Commission related to these programs. As actual DSM program costs are incurred, they are deferred as regulatory assets and recovered through a rider approved by the South Carolina Commission. The rider also provides for recovery of any net lost revenues and for a shared savings incentive. 
 In connection with the SCANA Combination, SCE&G agreed not to file a general rate case with the South Carolina Commission with a requested rate effective date earlier than January 2021. Rate adjustments are permitted prior to 2021 for fuel and environmental costs, DSM costs and other rates routinely adjusted on an annual or biennial basis. 
 See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, which is incorporated herein by reference.   GAS
Dominion Energy Questars natural gas development, production, transportation, and distribution services, including the rates it may charge its customers, are regulated by the state commissions of Utah, Wyoming and Idaho. East Ohios natural gas distribution services, including the rates it may charge its customers, are regulated by the Ohio Commission. Hopes natural gas distribution services are regulated by the West Virginia Commission. SCE&G and PSNCs natural gas distribution services are regulated by the South Carolina Commission and North Carolina Commission, respectively. 
 Gas Regulation in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho 
 Questar Gas is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the Utah, Wyoming and Idaho Commissions. The Idaho Commission has contracted with the Utah Commission for rate oversight of Questar Gas operations in a small area of southeastern Idaho. When necessary, Questar Gas seeks general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the cost-of-service by rate class. Base rates for Questar Gas are designed primarily based on rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges. The volumetric charges for the residential and small commercial customers in Utah and Wyoming are subject to revenue decoupling and adjusted for changes in usage per customer.
 In addition to general rate increases, Questar Gas makes routine separate filings with the Utah and Wyoming Commissions to reflect changes in the costs of purchased gas. The majority of these purchased gas costs are subject to rate recovery through the Wexpro Agreement and Wexpro II Agreement. Costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets. The purchased gas recovery filings generally cover a prospective twelve-month period. Approved increases or decreases in 

  gas cost recovery rates result in increases or decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses. 
 In connection with the Dominion Energy Questar Combination, Questar Gas withdrew its general rate case filed in July 2016 with the Utah Commission and agreed not to file a general rate case with the Utah Commission to adjust its base distribution non-gas rates prior to July 2019, unless otherwise ordered by the Utah Commission. In addition Questar Gas agreed not to file a general rate case with the Wyoming Commission with a requested rate effective date earlier than January 2020. This does not impact Questar Gas ability to adjust rates through various riders. See Notes 3 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Gas Regulation in Ohio 
 East Ohio is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the Ohio Commission. When necessary, East Ohio seeks general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the cost-of-service by rate class. A straight-fixed-variable rate design, in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through a monthly charge rather than a volumetric charge, is utilized to establish rates for a majority of East Ohios customers pursuant to a 2008 rate case settlement. 
 In addition to general base rate increases, East Ohio makes routine filings with the Ohio Commission to reflect changes in the costs of gas purchased for operational balancing on its system. These purchased gas costs are subject to rate recovery through a mechanism that ensures dollar for dollar recovery of prudently incurred costs. Costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets. The rider filings cover unrecovered gas costs plus prospective annual demand costs. Increases or decreases in gas cost rider rates result in increases or decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses. 
 The Ohio Commission has also approved several stand-alone cost recovery mechanisms to recover specified costs and a return for infrastructure projects and certain other costs that vary widely over time; such costs are excluded from general base rates. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Gas Regulation in West Virginia 
 Hope is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the West Virginia Commission. When necessary, Hope seeks general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the cost-of-service by rate class. Base rates for Hope are designed primarily based on rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges. 
 In addition to general rate increases, Hope makes routine separate filings with the West Virginia Commission to reflect changes in the costs of purchased gas. The majority of these purchased gas costs are subject to rate recovery through a mechanism that ensures dollar for dollar recovery of prudently incurred costs. Costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets. The purchased gas cost recovery filings gen-




23



 

  erally cover a prospective twelve-month period. Approved increases or decreases in gas cost recovery rates result in increases or decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses. 
 Legislation was passed in West Virginia authorizing a stand-alone cost recovery mechanism to recover specified costs and a return for infrastructure upgrades, replacements and expansions between general base rate cases. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Gas Regulation in North Carolina 
 PSNC is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the North Carolina Commission. PSNCs base rates are set in a general rate case based on the cost-of-service by rate class. Such rates are designed primarily based on a rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges. 
 PSNC has certain riders to its tariff that allow it to make periodic rate adjustment filings with the North Carolina Commission outside of a general rate case. PSNCs purchased gas adjustment allows it to recover from customers all prudently incurred gas costs and certain related uncollectible expenses. The purchased gas adjustment provides for a benchmark cost of gas rate component and a fixed gas cost component, both of which may be periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the costs of purchased gas, including transportation costs. In addition, PSNC utilizes a customer usage tracker, a decoupling mechanism, which allows it to adjust rates semi-annually for residential and commercial customers based on average customer consumption. PSNC also utilizes an integrity management tracker, which provides for semi-annual rate adjustments to recover the incurred capital investment and associated costs of complying with federal standards for pipeline integrity and safety requirements that are not in current base rates. All of these riders utilize deferral accounting to track over- and under-collected costs for subsequent rate consideration. 
 In connection with the SCANA Combination, PSNC agreed not to file a general rate case with the North Carolina Commission with a requested rate effective date earlier than November 2021 other than for rate adjustments pursuant to the customer usage tracker, the integrity management tracker and the purchased gas adjustment. 
 See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, which is incorporated herein by reference.   Gas Regulation in South Carolina 
 SCE&G is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its natural gas distribution service by the South Carolina Commission. SCE&G provides retail natural gas service to customers in areas in which it has received authorization from the South Carolina Commission and in municipalities in which it holds a franchise. SCE&Gs base rates can be adjusted annually, pursuant to the Natural Gas Rate Stabilization Act, for recovery of costs related to natural gas infrastructure. Base rates are set based on the cost-of-service by rate class approved by the South Carolina Commission in the latest general rate case. Base rates for SCE&G are designed primarily based on a rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges. SCE&G also utilizes a weather normalization adjustment to adjust its base rates during the winter billing 

  months for residential and commercial customers to mitigate the effects of unusually cold or warm weather. 
 In addition, SCE&Gs natural gas tariffs include a purchased gas adjustment that provides for the recovery of prudently incurred gas costs, including transportation costs. SCE&G is authorized to adjust its purchased gas rates monthly and makes routine filings with the South Carolina Commission to provide notification of changes in these rates. Costs that are under or over recovered are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities, respectively, and considered in subsequent purchased gas adjustments. The purchased gas adjustment filings generally cover a prospective twelve-month period. Increases or decreases in purchased gas costs can result in corresponding changes in purchased gas adjustment rates and the revenue generated by those rates. The South Carolina Commission reviews SCE&Gs gas purchasing policies and practices, including its administration of the purchased gas adjustment, annually. 
 See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Status of Competitive Retail Gas Services 
 The states of Ohio and West Virginia, in which Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas have gas distribution operations, have considered legislation regarding a competitive deregulation of natural gas sales at the retail level. 
 OhioSince October 2000, East Ohio has offered the Energy Choice program, under which residential and commercial customers are encouraged to purchase gas directly from retail suppliers or through a community aggregation program. In October 2006, East Ohio restructured its commodity service by entering into gas purchase contracts with selected suppliers at a fixed price above the New York Mercantile Exchange month-end settlement and passing that gas cost to customers under the Standard Service Offer program. Starting in April 2009, East Ohio buys natural gas under the Standard Service Offer program only for customers not eligible to participate in the Energy Choice program and places Energy Choice-eligible customers in a direct retail relationship with selected suppliers, which is designated on the customers bills. 
 In January 2013, the Ohio Commission granted East Ohios motion to fully exit the merchant function for its nonresidential customers, beginning in April 2013, which requires those customers to choose a retail supplier or be assigned to one at a monthly variable rate set by the supplier. At December 31, 2018, approximately 1.1 million of Dominion Energy Gas 1.2 million Ohio customers were participating in the Energy Choice program. Subject to the Ohio Commissions approval, East Ohio may eventually exit the gas merchant function in Ohio entirely and have all customers select an alternate gas supplier. East Ohio continues to be the provider of last resort in the event of default by a supplier. Large industrial customers in Ohio also source their own natural gas supplies. 
 West VirginiaAt this time, West Virginia has not enacted legislation allowing customers to choose providers in the retail natural gas markets served by Hope. However, the West Virginia Commission has issued regulations to govern pooling services, one of the tools that natural gas suppliers may utilize to provide retail customers a choice in the future and has issued rules requiring competitive gas service providers to be licensed in West Virginia.

Federal Regulations 
 FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION
Electric 
 Under the Federal Power Act, FERC regulates wholesale sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities. Virginia Power purchases and sells electricity in the PJM wholesale market and sells electricity to wholesale purchasers in Virginia and North Carolina. Dominion Energys merchant generators sell electricity in the PJM, CAISO and ISO-NE wholesale markets, and to wholesale purchasers in the states of Virginia, North Carolina, Indiana, Connecticut, Tennessee, Georgia, California, South Carolina and Utah, under Dominion Energys market-based sales tariffs authorized by FERC or pursuant to FERC authority to sell as a qualified facility. In addition, Virginia Power and SCE&G have FERC approval of a tariff to sell wholesale power at capped rates based on their respective embedded cost of generation. This cost-based sales tariff could be used to sell to loads within or outside Virginia Power and SCE&Gs service territories. Any such sales would be voluntary. 
 Dominion Energy and Virginia Power are subject to FERCs Standards of Conduct that govern conduct between transmission function employees of interstate gas and electricity transmission providers and the marketing function employees of their affiliates. The rule defines the scope of transmission and marketing-related functions that are covered by the standards and is designed to prevent transmission providers from giving their affiliates undue preferences. 
 Dominion Energy and Virginia Power are also subject to FERCs affiliate restrictions that (1) prohibit power sales between merchant plants and utility plants without first receiving FERC authorization, (2) require the merchant and utility plants to conduct their wholesale power sales operations separately, and (3) prohibit utilities from sharing market information with merchant plant operating personnel. The rules are designed to prohibit utilities from giving the merchant plants a competitive advantage. 
 EPACT included provisions to create an ERO. The ERO is required to promulgate mandatory reliability standards governing the operation of the bulk power system in the U.S. FERC has certified NERC as the ERO and also issued an initial order approving many reliability standards that went into effect in 2007. Entities that violate standards will be subject to fines of up to $1.2 million per day, per violation and can also be assessed non-monetary penalties, depending upon the nature and severity of the violation. 
 Dominion Energy and Virginia Power plan and operate their facilities in compliance with approved NERC reliability requirements. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power employees participate on various NERC committees, track the development and implementation of standards, and maintain proper compliance registration with NERCs regional organizations. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power anticipate incurring additional compliance expenditures over the next several years as a result of the implementation of new cybersecurity programs. In addition, NERC has redefined critical assets which expanded the number of assets subject to NERC reliability standards, including cybersecurity assets. NERC continues to develop additional requirements specifically regarding supply chain standards and control centers 

  that impact the bulk electric system. While Dominion Energy and Virginia Power expect to incur additional compliance costs in connection with NERC requirements and initiatives, such expenses are not expected to significantly affect results of operations. 
 In April 2008, FERC granted an application for Virginia Powers electric transmission operations to establish a forward-looking formula rate mechanism that updates transmission rates on an annual basis and approved an ROE effective as of January 1, 2008. The formula rate is designed to recover the expected revenue requirement for each calendar year and is updated based on actual costs. The FERC-approved formula method, which is based on projected costs, allows Virginia Power to earn a current return on its growing investment in electric transmission infrastructure. 
 Gas 
 FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended. Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over rates, terms and conditions of services performed by Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline, DETI, DECG, Iroquois and certain services performed by Cove Point. The design, construction and operation of Cove Points LNG facility, including associated natural gas pipelines, the Liquefaction Project and the import and export of LNG are also regulated by FERC. 
 Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas interstate gas transmission and storage activities are conducted on an open access basis, in accordance with certificates, tariffs and service agreements on file with FERC and FERC regulations. 
 Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas operate in compliance with FERC standards of conduct, which prohibit the sharing of certain non-public transmission information or customer specific data by its interstate gas transmission and storage companies with non-transmission function employees. Pursuant to these standards of conduct, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas also make certain informational postings available on Dominion Energys website. 
 See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Safety Regulations 
 Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas are also subject to the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, which mandate inspections of interstate and intrastate natural gas transmission and storage pipelines, particularly those located in areas of high-density population. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas have evaluated their natural gas transmission and storage properties, as required by the U.S. Department of Transportation regulations under these Acts, and have implemented a program of identification, testing and potential remediation activities. These activities are ongoing. 
 The Companies are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. The Companies have an internal safety, health and security program designed to mon-




25



 

  itor and enforce compliance with worker safety requirements, which is routinely reviewed and considered for improvement. The Companies believe that they are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations related to worker health and safety. Notwithstanding these preventive measures, incidents may occur that are outside of the Companies control. 
 Environmental Regulations 
 Each of the Companies operating segments faces substantial laws, regulations and compliance costs with respect to environmental matters. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. The cost of complying with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules is expected to be material to the Companies. If compliance expenditures and associated operating costs are not recoverable from customers through regulated rates (in regulated businesses) or market prices (in unregulated businesses), those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows. The Companies have applied for or obtained the necessary environmental permits for the construction and operation of their facilities. Many of these permits are subject to reissuance and continuing review. For a discussion of significant aspects of these matters, including current and planned capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance required to be discussed in this Item, see Environmental Matters in Future Issues and Other Matters in Item 7. MD&A, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Additional information can also be found in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
 AIR
The CAA is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nations air quality. Regulated emissions include, but are not limited to, carbon, methane, VOC, other GHGs, mercury, other toxic metals, hydrogen chloride, NOX, SO2 and particulate matter. At a minimum, delegated states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of the Companies facilities are subject to the CAAs permitting and other requirements. 
 GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE 
The Companies support national climate change legislation that would provide a consistent, economy-wide approach to addressing this issue and are currently taking action to protect the environment and reduce GHG emissions while meeting the growing needs of their customers. Dominion Energys CEO and operating segment CEOs are responsible for compliance with the laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including GHG emissions, and Dominion Energys Board of Directors receives periodic updates on these matters. See Environmental Strategy below, Environmental Matters in Future Issues and Other Matters in Item 7. MD&A and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on climate change legislation and regulation, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 

 WATER
The CWA is a comprehensive program requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate discharges to surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms. The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding discharges of effluent into surface waters and require permits to be obtained from the EPA or the analogous state agency for those discharges. Containment berms and similar structures may be required to help prevent accidental releases. Dominion Energy must comply with applicable CWA requirements at its current and former operating facilities. Stormwater related to construction activities is also regulated under the CWA and by state and local stormwater management and erosion and sediment control laws. From time to time, Dominion Energys projects and operations may impact tidal and non-tidal wetlands. In these instances, Dominion Energy must obtain authorization from the appropriate federal, state and local agencies prior to impacting wetlands. The authorizing agency may impose significant direct or indirect mitigation costs to compensate for such impacts to wetlands. 
 WASTE AND CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT
Dominion Energy is subject to various federal and state laws and implementing regulations governing the management, storage, treatment, reuse and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances, including the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, CERCLA, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 and the Toxic Substance Control Act of 1976. Dominion Energys operations and construction activities, including activities associated with oil and gas production and gas storage wells, generate waste. Across Dominion Energy, completion water is disposed at commercial disposal facilities. Produced water is either hauled for disposal, evaporated or injected into company and third-party owned underground injection wells. Wells drilled in tight-gas-sand and shale reservoirs require hydraulic-fracture stimulation to achieve economic production rates and recoverable reserves. The majority of Wexpros current and future production and reserve potential is derived from reservoirs that require hydraulic-fracture stimulation to be commercially viable. Currently, all well construction activities, including hydraulic-fracture stimulation and management and disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids, are regulated by federal and state agencies that review and approve all aspects of gas- and oil-well design and operation. 
 PROTECTED SPECIES
The ESA and analogous state laws prohibit activities that can result in harm to specific species of plants and animals, as well as impacts to the habitat on which those species depend. In addition to ESA programs, the MBTA and BGEPA establish broader prohibitions on harm to protected birds. Many of the Companies facilities are subject to requirements of the ESA, MBTA and BGEPA. The ESA and BGEPA require potentially lengthy coordination with the state and federal agencies to ensure potentially affected species are protected. Ultimately, the suite of species protections may restrict company activities to certain times of year, project modifications may be necessary to avoid harm, or a permit may be needed for unavoidable taking of the species. The authorizing agency may impose mitigation requirements and costs 


26



 

  to compensate for harm of a protected species or habitat loss. These requirements and time of year restrictions can result in adverse impacts on project plans and schedules such that the Companies businesses may be materially affected. 
 OTHER REGULATIONS
Other significant environmental regulations to which the Companies are subject include federal and state laws protecting graves, sacred sites, historic sites and cultural resources, including those of American Indian tribal nations and tribal communities. These can result in compliance and mitigation costs as well as potential adverse effects on project plans and schedules such that the Companies businesses may be materially affected. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
 All aspects of the operation and maintenance of Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers nuclear power stations are regulated by the NRC. Operating licenses issued by the NRC are subject to revocation, suspension or modification, and the operation of a nuclear unit may be suspended if the NRC determines that the public interest, health or safety so requires. 
 From time to time, the NRC adopts new requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. In many cases, these new regulations require changes in the design, operation and maintenance of existing nuclear facilities. If the NRC adopts such requirements in the future, it could result in substantial increases in the cost of operating and maintaining Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers nuclear generating units. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 The NRC also requires Dominion Energy and Virginia Power to decontaminate their nuclear facilities once operations cease. This process is referred to as decommissioning, and Dominion Energy and Virginia Power are required by the NRC to be financially prepared. For information on decommissioning trusts, see Power Generation-Nuclear Decommissioning and Southeast Energy-Nuclear Decommissioning above and Notes 3 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Notes 3 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on spent nuclear fuel. 
 

ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGY
The Companies environmental strategy is a component of the overall long-term strategic planning overseen by the CEO and Board of Directors, including oversight by the sustainability and corporate responsibility board committee which was formed in 2018. The Companies are committed to continuing to be an industry leader, delivering safe, reliable, clean and affordable energy while fully complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Additionally, the Companies seek to build partnerships and engage with local communities, stakeholders and customers on environmental issues important to them, including environmental justice considerations such as fair treatment, inclusive involvement and effective communication. The Companies believe in being transparent about their environmental commitments, policies, including the Environmental Justice Policy adopted in 2018, and initiatives which have been 

  disclosed in reports included on Dominion Energys website. The Companies are dedicated to meeting their customers growing energy needs with innovative, sustainable solutions. It is the Companies belief that sustainable solutions should strive to balance the interdependent goals of environmental stewardship and economic effects. The integrated strategy to meet these objectives consists of three major elements: 
 
 | Reduction of GHG emissions;
--+----------------------------


 | Energy infrastructure modernization, including natural gas and electric operations; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Conservation and energy efficiency.
--+------------------------------------

 Reduction of GHG Emissions 
 The Companies integrated strategy has resulted in a reduction in GHG emission intensity. Over the past two decades, the Companies have made changes to the generation mix and to natural gas operations which have significantly improved environmental performance. For example, Power Generation has reduced both its carbon emissions and its carbon intensity while generating electricity with an increasingly clean portfolio. From 2000 through 2017, Dominion Energys carbon intensity decreased by 50%. This strategy has also resulted in measurable reductions of other air pollutants such as NOX, SO2 and mercury and also reduced the amount of coal ash generated and the amount of water withdrawn. The principal components of the strategy include initiatives that address electric energy production and delivery, natural gas storage, transmission and delivery and energy management. 
 See Operating Segments for more information on certain of the projects described above. 
 CLEANER GENERATION
Renewable energy is an important component of a diverse and reliable energy mix that helps to mitigate the environmental aspects of energy production. Dominion Energy has nearly 2,600 MW of solar generating capacity in operation or under development in nine states, including offtake agreements for Virginia Powers utility customers. Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina have passed legislation setting targets for renewable power. Dominion Energy continues to add utility-scale solar capacity and is committed to meeting Virginias goals of 12% of base year electric energy sales from renewable power sources by 2022, and 15% by 2025, North Carolinas Renewable Portfolio Standard of 12.5% by 2021 and South Carolinas goal of 2% of aggregate generation capacity from renewable power sources by 2021. Backed by a $1 billion investment from 2018 through 2020, Dominion Energy has grown its solar fleet in Virginia and North Carolina to about 1,700 MW in service, in construction or under development. 
 See Operating Segments and Item 2. Properties for additional information, including Dominion Energys merchant solar properties. 
 GHG EMISSIONS
Since 2000, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power have tracked the emissions of their electric generation fleet, which employs a mix of fuel and renewable energy sources. Comparing annual year 2017 to annual year 2000, the entire electric generating fleet 


27



 

  (based on ownership percentage) reduced its average CO2 emissions per MWh of energy produced from electric generation by approximately 50%. Comparing annual year 2017 to annual year 2000, the regulated electric generating fleet (based on ownership percentage) reduced its average CO2 emissions per MWh of energy produced from electric generation by approximately 35%. Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers 2018 emissions data is not yet available. 
 Dominion Energy also develops a comprehensive GHG inventory annually. For Power Generation, Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers direct CO2 equivalent emissions (based on ownership percentage) were 30.1 million metric tons and 26.4 million metric tons, respectively, in 2017, compared to 37.2 million metric tons and 33.1 million metric tons, respectively, in 2016. The corresponding Power Generation carbon intensity rates for Dominion Energy were 0.295 metric tons CO2 equivalent emissions per net MWh in 2017 and 0.339 metric tons CO2 equivalent emissions per net MWh in 2016. 
 For Power Deliverys regulated electric transmission and distribution operations, direct CO2 equivalent emissions for 2017 were 37,841 metric tons, compared to 42,847 metric tons in 2016. 
 Dominion Energys natural gas companies have been reporting GHG emissions to the EPA since 2011 under the GHG Reporting Program. In January 2016, the GHG Reporting Program was expanded to also include GHG inputs and emissions associated with natural gas gathering and boosting sources and transmission pipeline blowdowns for facilities that exceed 25,000 metric tons per year of CO2 equivalent emissions. The sources within these new facilities were not previously covered under the rule and the first reports for these new sources were submitted to the EPA on March 31, 2017. 
 Hope and East Ohios direct CO2 equivalent emissions together increased to 0.88 million metric tons in 2017 from 0.86 in 2016. DETI and Cove Points direct CO2 equivalent emissions together were 1.6 million metric tons in 2017, increasing from 1.3 million metric tons in 2016, attributable to increased operational activity related to new construction. 

 The Companies GHG inventory follows all methodologies specified in the EPA Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 98 for calculating emissions. Total CO2 equivalent emissions reported for our natural gas assets, as estimated in Dominion Energys corporate inventory, were 3.51 million metric tons in 2017. This estimate includes emissions reported under the GHG Reporting Program, as well as other emissions not required to be reported under the federal program. The 2017 corporate GHG inventory emission estimate includes Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline, Questar Gas and Wexpro for the entire calendar year. Dominion Energys 2017 methane emissions reported under Subpart W of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule are as follows: 
 

Subpart W Segment | Subpart WTotal CH4Emissions (mcf CH4) | 
Distribution | | 1,668,183
Production | | 762,788 
Transmission pipelines | | 396,720 
Transmission compressor stations | | 147,565 
Gathering and boosting | | 144,188 
Storage | | 53,748 
LNG import/export | | 6,444 
Processing | | 916 

Energy Infrastructure Modernization 
 Dominion Energys investment plan from 2019 through 2023 includes a focus on upgrading the electric grid in Virginia through investments in additional renewable generation facilities, smart meters, customer information platform, intelligent grid devices and associated control systems, physical and cyber security investments, strategic undergrounding and energy conservation programs. Dominion Energy also plans to upgrade its gas and electric transmission and distribution networks and meet environmental requirements and standards set by various regulatory bodies. These enhancements are primarily aimed at meeting Dominion Energys continued goal of providing reliable service and to address increases in electricity consumption. An additional benefit will be added capacity to efficiently deliver electricity from the renewable projects now being developed, or to be developed in the future, to meet our customers preference for cleaner energy. See Operating Segments for additional information. 
 The Companies have also implemented infrastructure improvements and improved operational practices to reduce the GHG emissions from our natural gas facilities. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas, in connection with the investment plan, are also pursuing the construction or upgrade of regulated infrastructure in their natural gas businesses. The Companies have made voluntary commitments as part of the EPA Methane Challenge Program to continue to reduce methane emissions as part of these improvements. See Operating Segments for additional information, including natural gas infrastructure projects. 
 Conservation and Energy Efficiency 
 Conservation and load management play a significant role in meeting the growing demand for electricity and natural gas, while also helping to reduce the environmental footprint of our customers. The Companies offer various energy efficiency programs in Virginia, 


28



 

  North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wyoming designed to reduce energy consumption including programs such as: 
 
 | Energy audits and assessments;
--+-------------------------------


 | Incentives for customers to upgrade or install certain energy efficient measures and/or systems;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Weatherization assistance to help income-eligible customers reduce their energy usage;
