Overview
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company advancing novel and potentially lifesaving investigational therapies derived from our Epigenetic Regulator Program. Larsucosterol (also known as “DUR‑928”), a new chemical entity in clinical development, is the lead candidate in our Epigenetic Regulator Program. An endogenous, orally bioavailable small molecule, larsucosterol has been shown in both in vitro and in vivo studies to play an important regulatory role in lipid metabolism, stress and inflammatory responses, and cell death and survival. We are developing larsucosterol for alcohol-associated hepatitis (also called “alcoholic hepatitis” or “AH”), a life-threatening acute liver condition with no approved therapeutics and a 28-Day and 90-Day historical mortality rate of 20%-26% and 29%-31%, respectively. After completing a Phase 2a trial in which 100% of AH patients treated with larsucosterol survived the 28-Day study period, we are now conducting a ~300-patient, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial called "AHFIRM" (trial in AH to evaluate saFety and effIcacy of laRsucosterol treatMent). Through our AHFIRM trial, we are evaluating larsucosterol’s potential to reduce mortality or liver transplantation compared to a placebo with or without steroids at the investigators’ discretion. Currently, we anticipate dosing the last patient in the AHFIRM trial in the second quarter of 2023, which should enable top-line results to be reported in the second half of 2023. If the AHFIRM trial is successful, it may support a New Drug Application (“NDA”) filing and we may decide to develop our own commercial, sales and marketing organization. We have also investigated larsucosterol in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) with encouraging results in a Phase 1b clinical trial and are considering further development of larsucosterol for this and other indications.
In addition to our Epigenetic Regulator Program, we developed a novel and proprietary post-surgical pain product called POSIMIR that utilizes our innovative SABER platform technology to enable continuous sustained delivery of bupivacaine, a non-opioid local analgesic, over three days in adults. In February 2021, POSIMIR received U.S. FDA approval for post-surgical pain reduction for up to 72 hours following arthroscopic subacromial decompression. In December 2021, we entered into a license agreement (the “Innocoll Agreement”) with Innocoll Pharmaceuticals Limited (“Innocoll”), pursuant to which the Company granted to Innocoll an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize POSIMIR in the U.S. In September 2022, Innocoll launched POSIMIR in the U.S.

Epigenetic Regulator Program and New Chemical Entities
 Epigenetic regulation influences the expression of genes through the silencing or initiation of gene activity without modifying the DNA sequence. For instance, methylation (the chemical binding of a methyl group) of cytosine nucleotides in promoter regions of DNA, facilitated by DNA methyltransferases (“DNMTs”), will generally result in downregulation of gene expression, while demethylation (removal of a methyl group) generally results in upregulation. DNA methylation/demethylation can thus regulate the expression of relevant genes, especially clusters of master genes that further modulate crucial cellular activities.

Our Epigenetic Regulator Program involves a multi-year collaborative effort with the Department of Internal Medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University (“VCU”), the VCU Medical Center and the McGuire VA Medical Center. The knowledge base supporting this program is a result of more than 30 years of lipid research by Shunlin Ren, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Internal Medicine at the VCU Medical Center. The lead compound from this program, larsucosterol, is an endogenous sulfated oxysterol, which acts as an epigenetic regulator. Under a license with VCU, we hold the exclusive royalty-bearing worldwide right to develop and commercialize larsucosterol and related molecules discovered in the program.
 In March 2021, a peer-reviewed research paper regarding the proposed mechanism of action of larsucosterol was published in The Journal of Lipid Research. The research showed that larsucosterol (referred to in the paper as “25HC3S”) bound to and inhibited the activities of DNMTs 1, 3a and 3b, enzymes that add methyl groups to DNA (a process called “DNA methylation”), as well as reduced DNA hypermethylation. DNMTs 1 and 3a have been shown to be over-expressed in the livers of patients with severe AH. As such, by inhibiting DNMTs 1 and 3a activities, larsucosterol may inhibit DNA hypermethylation, thereby modulating the expression of genes and pathways that are involved in crucial cellular activities, including those associated with cell death, stress response, and lipid biosynthesis. These modulations may lead to improved cell survival, reduced lipid accumulation or lipotoxicity, minimized inflammation, and enhanced liver regeneration, as has been observed in various in vivo animal models and in results from our completed clinical trials in AH and NASH patients.
The biological activity of larsucosterol has been demonstrated in over a dozen different animal disease models involving three animal species. Some of these models represent acute organ injuries (e.g., LPS-induced endotoxin shock, drug-induced acute oxidative stress injury, ischemic-reperfusion-induced kidney and brain injury), and some represent chronic metabolic disorders (e.g., NASH).
 Our major product research and development efforts for larsucosterol are described in the following table:



In pharmacokinetic (“PK”) and toxicology studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, minipigs and monkeys, larsucosterol has been found to be well tolerated and safe by all routes of administration tested to date. These results support the use of larsucosterol in completed and ongoing human safety, PK, proof-of-concept, and efficacy trials. The chronic toxicity of larsucosterol was further assessed in a 6-month oral study in rats and in a 9-month oral study in dogs. These studies support the use of larsucosterol in long duration human trials.

Acute Organ Injury Program with Injectable Larsucosterol
 
Market Opportunity. AH, an acute form of alcohol-associated liver disease, is associated with long-term heavy intake of alcohol and often occurs after a recent period of increased alcohol consumption. AH is typically characterized by recent onset jaundice and hepatic failure. A Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (“MELD”) score is a commonly used scoring system to assess the severity and prognosis of AH patients. AH was associated with approximately 158,000 U.S. hospitalizations in 2020 according to the available data published for that year. A retrospective analysis of 77 studies published between 1971 and 2016, which included data from a total of 8,184 patients, showed the overall mortality from AH was 26% at 28 days, 29% at 90 days and 44% at 180 days. A subsequent global study published in December 2021, which included 85 tertiary centers in 11 countries across 3 continents, prospectively enrolled 2,581 AH patients with a median MELD score of 23.5, reported mortality at 28 and 90 days of approximately 20% and 31%, respectively.
There are no FDA approved therapies for AH and stopping alcohol consumption is necessary, but frequently not sufficient for recovery in many moderate and severe patients. Corticosteroids do not improve survival at 90 days or one year, and have demonstrated an increased risk of infection. In addition, fewer than 50% of AH patients are eligible for corticosteroids. According to a recent study, the healthcare costs associated with treating hospitalized AH patients and their length of hospital stay are significant.

Each hospitalization episode with AH diagnosis for patients who: | Average length of stay | Average total charges during hospital stay
Died during the hospitalization | 9 days | $147,000 
Were discharged | 6 days | $53,000 
Marlowe, N., Lam, D., Krebs, W., Lin, W. & Liangpunsakul, S. (2022) Prevalence, co-morbidities, and in-hospital mortality of patients hospitalized with alcohol-associated hepatitis in the United States from 2015 to 2019. Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.

 
The rate of AH patients undergoing liver transplantation has increased in recent years, although the total number of such transplants is still relatively small. Average charges for a liver transplant exceed $875,000, and patients require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy to prevent organ rejection.
Clinical Program. In 2019, we completed a Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating safety and PK of intravenously (“IV”) infused larsucosterol in patients with moderate and severe AH. Severity of AH was determined by MELD scores with moderate defined as MELD 11-20 and severe as MELD 21-30. This was an open label, dose escalation (30 mg, 90 mg and 150 mg), multi-center U.S. study, designed to be conducted in two sequential parts. Part A included patients with moderate AH and Part B included patients with severe AH.
In this Phase 2a trial, dose escalation was permitted following review of safety and PK results of the prior dose level by a Dose Escalation Committee. The target number of patients for the study was 4 per dose group. Final enrollment included 19 patients with moderate (7 of 19) and severe AH (12 of 19), who received IV larsucosterol at 30 mg, 90 mg, or 150 mg doses. Eight patients (four moderate and four severe) were dosed at 30mg, seven patients (three moderate and four severe) were dosed at 90mg and four patients (all severe) were dosed at 150mg. After being discharged on Day 2, one patient did not return for the scheduled Day 7 and Day 28 follow-up visits; therefore Lille, bilirubin and MELD data reported below are based on 18 patients. The objectives of this study included assessment of safety, PK and pharmacodynamic signals, including liver biochemistry, biomarkers and prognostic scores, including the Lille score, following larsucosterol treatment.
In November 2019, the results from this Phase 2a clinical trial of larsucosterol in AH were presented as a late-breaking oral presentation at The Liver Meeting®. The study summary results were also selected for inclusion in the ‘Best of The Liver Meeting’ presentation in the alcohol-related liver disease category.
All 19 patients treated with larsucosterol in this trial survived the 28-day follow-up period and there were no drug-related serious adverse events. Using an alternative measure of AH severity to MELD, Maddrey’s Discrimination Function (“DF”), 15 of the 19 patients had DF scores of 32 or greater, indicating that they had severe AH. Patients treated with larsucosterol had a statistically significant reduction from baseline in bilirubin at Day 7 and Day 28, and MELD at Day 28. Lille scores, described below, were also statistically significantly lower than those from a well-matched group of patients in a contemporary trial as well as several published historical controls. 74% of all larsucosterol treated patients and 67% of those with severe AH were discharged from the hospital within 4 days after receiving a single dose of larsucosterol.

Lille
 Lille scores are used in clinical practice to help determine the prognosis and response of AH patients after 7 days of treatment. The lower the Lille score, the better the prognosis. Patients with a Lille score below 0.45, treatment responders, have a six-month survival rate of 85% compared to those with Lille scores above 0.45, who have only a 25% six-month survival rate. The chart below shows the Lille scores for individual AH patients treated with larsucosterol plotted as a function of their baseline MELD scores. In our study, the median Lille score for patients treated with larsucosterol was 0.10. The median Lille score among a cohort of 16 patients treated with standard of care at the University of Louisville (“UL”) was 0.41 (shown as historical control).
 



1)Our advisor, Dr. Craig McClain from UL, shared anonymized data from his study, in which 16 AH patients with initial MELD scores ranging from 15-30 received either supportive care alone (n=9 moderate AH patients) or supportive care with corticosteroids (n=7 severe AH patients). Two of the UL control patients died by Day 28.
 2)One patient in the larsucosterol group did not return for the Day 7 or Day 28 visits. All 19 patients treated with larsucosterol in this trial survived the 28-Day follow-up period.
 3)Lille scores in the larsucosterol group were significantly lower than that of the UL patients (p=0.01; Wilcoxon's Rank Sum Test).
 
As shown in the table below, all patients in the 30 mg and 90 mg larsucosterol dosing groups were treatment responders based on their Lille scores, regardless of disease severity by DF, MELD, or baseline serum bilirubin levels. 89% of the overall larsucosterol patient population (16 of 18) were treatment responders based on Lille. Patients with severe AH, as defined by DF ≥32 or MELD 21-30, and baseline serum bilirubin above 8 mg/dL, had similarly high response rates to larsucosterol treatment.

 2)Including patients receiving 30 mg, 90 mg and 150 mg of larsucosterol. 
 3)Excluding patients receiving 150 mg of larsucosterol.
 4)DF is calculated using the patient’s prothrombin time and serum bilirubin level. DF was introduced in 1978 as a predictor of significant mortality risk for AH patients. A DF≥32 identified AH patients with a 30-Day mortality rate of ≥50%.
 
The Lille scores of patients treated with larsucosterol in this trial were also significantly lower than several selected published historical studies (Hepatology 2007, 45:1348-1354; Gut 2011, 60:255-260), in which patients had similar baseline bilirubin, albumin, creatinine, prothrombin time and DF scores, and were treated with standard of care with or without corticosteroids. Due to the historical nature of these studies, such comparisons should be interpreted with caution.

A sub-group analysis was conducted to compare severe AH patients in the 30 mg and 90 mg dosing groups (n=8) with well-matched severe AH patients (n=13) who received corticosteroids for 28 days in a contemporaneous study at UL. Patients shown in the chart below in the UL steroid group had a mean baseline MELD of 24.46 and mean baseline Maddrey’s DF score of 62.98. The 8 patients in the larsucosterol group had baseline mean MELD of 24.50 and mean baseline Maddrey’s DF score of 61.25. All patients treated with larsucosterol survived the 28-Day follow up period, while 3 of the 13 patients (23%) in the UL steroid group died within the first 28 days.
 


The steroid group in the above graph includes the 7 severe AH patients treated with steroids from the UL group shown in the MELD vs Lille graph above plus an additional 6 severe AH patients subsequently treated in the UL study.

Bilirubin
 Bilirubin is formed by the breakdown of red blood cells in the body. The level of total bilirubin in the blood is an indication of how the liver is functioning. Elevated bilirubin levels usually signify liver dysfunction and disease. In this trial (shown in the chart below), patients treated with larsucosterol had a significant early reduction from baseline in bilirubin by Day 7. Patients with more elevated bilirubin at baseline (serum bilirubin >8 mg/dL) had a median reduction from baseline of 25% by Day 7 and 48% by Day 28.



*p<0.05 compared to baseline (Wilcoxon's Signed Rank Test)
 
As discussed above, MELD is another commonly used scoring system used to assess the severity and prognosis of AH patients. Patients with MELD scores of 11-20 are classified as having moderate AH and patients with MELD scores of 21-30 are classified as having severe AH. As with Lille scores, the lower the MELD score, the better the prognosis for the AH patient. In this trial (shown in the chart below), the median reduction from baseline in MELD among all larsucosterol treated patients was >2 points and among those with baseline bilirubin levels >8 mg/dL was 5 points by Day 28.
 
   
*p<0.05 compared to baseline (Wilcoxon's Signed Rank Test)
 MELD is calculated based on (a) bilirubin, (b) serum creatinine (sCr), and (c) International Normalized Ratio ("INR"), which is a measure of prothrombin time.
 
Safety and Pharmacokinetics
 In the Phase 2a study of larsucosterol in AH, larsucosterol was well tolerated at all doses tested. There were no drug-related serious adverse events and only three adverse events designated as possibly or probably related to larsucosterol: one occurrence of moderate generalized pruritus, one mild rash and one grade two alkaline phosphatase elevation. There were no discontinuations, early withdrawals or termination of study drug or study participation due to adverse events. All patients treated with larsucosterol survived through the 28-Day follow-up period. Drug exposures were dose proportional and were not affected by the severity of the disease.
 In December 2020, we announced that the FDA had granted larsucosterol Fast Track Designation for the treatment of AH. The FDA grants Fast Track Designation to facilitate development and expedite the review of therapies with the potential to treat a serious condition where there is an unmet medical need. A therapeutic that receives Fast Track Designation may benefit from early and frequent communication with the agency in addition to a rolling submission of the marketing application, with the objective of getting important new therapies to patients more quickly.
 In January 2021, we announced the dosing of the first patient in our Phase 2b AHFIRM study of patients with severe AH. AHFIRM is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multi-center Phase 2b study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of larsucosterol in approximately 300 patients with severe AH. The study is comprised of three arms targeting approximately 100 patients each: (1) Placebo plus supportive care, with or without methylprednisolone capsules at the investigators’ discretion; (2) larsucosterol (30 mg); and (3) larsucosterol (90 mg). Patients in the larsucosterol arms receive the same supportive care without steroids. In order to maintain blinding, patients in the two active arms receive matching placebo capsules if the investigator prescribes steroids. Patients receive an IV dose of larsucosterol or placebo (sterile water) on Day 1 and a second identical IV dose on Day 4 if they are still hospitalized. The primary outcome measure will be the 90-Day incidence of mortality or liver
transplantation for patients treated with larsucosterol compared to those treated with placebo. Secondary endpoints include the difference in 90-Day mortality between patients treated with larsucosterol compared to those treated with placebo, the difference in 28-Day mortality or liver transplantation for patients treated with larsucosterol compared to those treated with placebo, and the difference in mortality between patients treated with larsucosterol compared to those treated with placebo. We now have over 60 clinical trial sites across the United States, U.K., E.U. and Australia. We currently expect to enroll the last patient in the AHFIRM trial in the second quarter of 2023, which should enable top-line results to be reported in the second half of 2023.
 Phase 1 trials of larsucosterol administered through injection have supported the development of larsucosterol in AH. The initial Phase 1 trial in healthy subjects was a single-site, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single-ascending-dose study that evaluated the safety, tolerability and PK of intramuscular ("IM") injected larsucosterol. The 24-subject study (16 healthy volunteers on larsucosterol and 8 on placebo) of four escalating dose levels resulted in dose proportional systemic exposure of larsucosterol. Larsucosterol was well-tolerated at all dose levels, with no serious treatment-related adverse events reported. We also conducted a multiple-dose study involving 10 healthy subjects, in which participants received IM-injected larsucosterol for five consecutive days (8 subjects on larsucosterol, 2 on placebo) using the next to highest dose from the single dose study. No serious treatment related adverse events were reported, no subjects withdrew from the study, no accumulation in plasma concentrations were observed with repeat dosing, and the pain scores and injection site reactions were minimal. We also conducted a single-ascending IV dose infusion study with 16 healthy subjects and observed no treatment-related serious adverse events. The systemic exposure following IV infusion was dose proportional.
A Phase 1 drug-drug interaction study conducted in healthy subjects demonstrated that neither orally administered nor IV injected larsucosterol at doses tested affected the safety and PK of midazolam, a drug metabolized by CYP3A4, which is one of the important enzymes associated with clinically relevant drug-drug interactions.
 We also conducted a Phase 1b study with injected larsucosterol in patients with impaired kidney function (stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease ("CKD")) and matched control subjects ("MCS"), matched by age, body mass and gender with normal kidney function. This study was a single-site, open-label, single-ascending-dose study in two successive cohorts (first a low dose of 30 mg and then a high dose of 120 mg) evaluating safety and PK of IM injected larsucosterol. The low dose cohort consisted of 6 patients with CKD and 3 MCS; the high dose cohort consisted of 5 CKD patients and 3 MCS. In this trial, larsucosterol was well tolerated among all subjects and the PK parameters between the kidney function impaired patients and the MCS were comparable.

Chronic Liver Disease Program with Orally Administered Larsucosterol
 Market Opportunity. NAFLD is the most common form of chronic liver disease in both children and adults. It is estimated that NAFLD affects approximately 30% to 40% of adults and 10% of children in the United States. NASH, a more severe and progressive form of NAFLD, is one of the most common chronic liver diseases worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 3-5% globally. No drug is currently approved for treatment of NAFLD or NASH. In addition to these liver diseases, there are a number of orphan liver diseases for which we may seek to develop larsucosterol.
 Clinical Program. In 2020, we completed a Phase 1b randomized, multi-center, and open-label clinical study in the United States to evaluate safety, PK and signals of biological activity of larsucosterol in NASH patients with stage 1-3 fibrosis. Larsucosterol (at doses of 50 mg QD, 150 mg QD and 300 mg BID) was administered orally for 28 days with 20 patients or more per dose group for a total of 65 patients in the trial. Key endpoints included safety and PK, and clinical chemistry/efficacy signals, such as liver enzymes (e.g., ALT, AST and GGT (each as defined below)), serum lipids (e.g., triglycerides), biomarkers (e.g., CK-18s, inflammatory cytokines), and insulin resistance (i.e., HOMA-IR), as well as liver fat content and liver stiffness by imaging (e.g., MRI-PDFF (as defined below) and FibroScan®).
Both the 50 mg and 600 mg dose groups showed a statistically significant median reduction at Day 28 from baseline of serum alanine aminotransferase (“ALT”) levels at -16% and -17%, respectively. The 600 mg dose group also showed statistically significant median reductions at Day 28 from baseline of serum aspartate aminotransferase (“AST”) (-18%) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (“GGT”) (-8%), and the 50 mg dose group had a statistically significant reduction at Day 28 from baseline in liver stiffness as measured by Fibroscan® (-10%).
Patients in the 50 mg or 150 mg dose groups also had statistically significant median reduction at Day 28 from baseline of serum triglycerides (-13% in the 50 mg group) or LDL-C (-11% in the 150 mg group). Patients with elevated baseline triglycerides (≥200 mg/dL; n=16) across all dose groups had a median reduction at Day 28 from baseline of -24% (p <0.01). Furthermore, patients in the 50 mg and 150 mg groups had 22% and 18%, respectively, median reductions (not statistically significant) of HOMA-IR from baseline respectively after 4 weeks of daily oral dosing of larsucosterol. The 600 mg group did not show a change in HOMA-IR.
 At Day 28, 43% of patients in all three dose groups showed greater than or equal to 10% liver fat reduction from baseline as measured by magnetic resonance imaging - proton density fat fraction ("MRI-PDFF"). In this subgroup, there was a significant reduction from baseline in median liver fat content (-18%, -19%, and -23%, in the 50 mg, 150 mg and 600 mg groups, respectively). The reduction of liver fat content was accompanied by a significant median reduction from baseline of serum ALT (-21%, -19%, and -32%, in the 50 mg, 150 mg and 600 mg groups, respectively), as well as both CK-18, M30 and M65 (each as defined below) in the 50 mg and 600 mg groups.
 Larsucosterol was well tolerated at all three doses evaluated. There were no serious adverse events reported during the study, and no discontinuations, early withdrawals or termination of study drug or study participation due to adverse events. PK parameters after repeat dosing were comparable to those after a single dose (from a prior study), indicating no accumulation of the drug after repeat dosing.
We have completed multiple Phase 1 trials in healthy subjects with orally administered larsucosterol. These include single-ascending-dose and multiple-ascending-dose studies as well as a food effect study. In all of these studies larsucosterol was well-tolerated at all dose levels, with no serious treatment-related adverse events reported. Dose-related increases in plasma concentrations were observed and no accumulation in plasma concentrations or food effects were observed with repeat dosing.
We also conducted a Phase 1b trial in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic NASH patients and MCS (matched by age, body mass index and gender with normal liver function) utilizing orally administered larsucosterol. This was an open-label, single-ascending-dose safety and PK study conducted in Australia in two successive dose cohorts (first a low dose of 50 mg and then a high dose of 200 mg). Both cohorts consisted of 10 NASH patients and 6 MCS. Data from this study were presented at the International Liver Congress 2017 organized by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in Amsterdam in April 2017. All patients and MCS in this study tolerated larsucosterol well. One patient (with a prior history of arrhythmia and an ongoing viral infection) in the high dose cohort experienced a serious adverse event (i.e., shortness of breath), which occurred without unusual biochemical changes and resolved without intervention but was considered possibly treatment related by the physician due to its temporal association with dosing. In both low and high dose cohorts, the PK parameters were comparable between the NASH patients and the MCS. In addition, the systemic exposure following the low and high doses of larsucosterol was dose dependent.
 While this study was not designed to assess efficacy, we observed statistically significant reductions from baseline levels of several biomarkers after both doses of larsucosterol. A single oral dose of larsucosterol significantly reduced the levels of both full-length (“M65”) and cleaved (“M30”) cytokeratin-18 (“CK-18”), bilirubin, hsCRP, and IL-18 in these subjects. The mean reduction of full-length CK-18 (a generalized cell death marker) at the measured time point of greatest effect (12 hours after dosing) was 33% in the low dose cohort and 41% in the high dose cohort. The mean decrease of cleaved CK-18 (a cell apoptosis marker) at the measured time point of greatest effect (12 hours after dosing) was 37% in the low dose cohort and 47% in the high dose cohort. The mean reduction of total bilirubin (a liver function marker) at the measured time point of greatest effect (12 hours after dosing) was 27% in the low dose cohort and 31% in the high dose cohort. The mean decrease of hsCRP (a marker of inflammation) at the measured time point of greatest effect (24 hours after dosing) was 8% in the low
dose cohort and 13% in the high dose cohort. The mean decrease of IL-18 (an inflammatory mediator) at the measured time point of greatest effect (8 hours after dosing) was 4% in the low dose cohort and 8% in the high dose cohort.
 We also conducted a Phase 1b open-label, multi-center U.S. study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of larsucosterol in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B scores, n=10) and severe (Child-Pugh C scores, n=7) hepatic function impairment ("HI"), and MCS (n=10) with normal hepatic function. Each subject received a single oral dose of 200 mg larsucosterol. Results from this study were presented at the International Liver Conference 2021 (EASL). Larsucosterol was safe and well-tolerated by all moderate and severe HI subjects with no adverse events and no dose-limiting toxicity reported throughout the study. As expected, clearance of larsucosterol was decreased in HI subjects compared to MCS with normal hepatic function, resulting in a 4-10-fold higher drug exposure (Cmax and AUC) in HI subjects. Additionally, a single oral dose of 200 mg of larsucosterol in subjects with HI resulted in statistically significant median reductions from baseline of the apoptosis biomarker M30 (cCK-18) at 12 hours post-dose.
 Collectively, the biological signals observed in NASH and HI patients plus results from our animal models and cell culture studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of larsucosterol for patients with liver diseases. However, additional studies are required to evaluate the safety and efficacy of larsucosterol, and there is no assurance that these biomarker, clinical chemistry and liver imaging effects will be associated with clinically relevant benefits, or that larsucosterol will demonstrate safety or efficacy in treating liver diseases in our ongoing or future trials.

product. At the end of surgery, POSIMIR is administered into the subacromial space under direct arthroscopic visualization, where it continuously releases bupivacaine for 72 hours or more.
In February 2021, the FDA approved POSIMIR for infiltration use in adults for administration into the subacromial space under direct arthroscopic visualization to produce post-surgical analgesia for up to 72 hours following arthroscopic subacromial decompression.
In December 2021, we entered into the Innocoll Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Innocoll an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize POSIMIR in the U.S. with respect to all uses and applications in humans. The Innocoll Agreement provides for the assignment of our supply agreement with a contract manufacturing organization to Innocoll and also provides Innocoll with the right, within the U.S., to expand the approved indications of POSIMIR. We retain, outside the U.S., all of the global rights to POSIMIR. Innocoll paid us an initial non-refundable, upfront fee of $4.0 million as well as a fee in the amount of $1.3 million primarily to cover the manufacturing supplies and excipients and certain equipment transferred to Innocoll pursuant to the terms of the Innocoll Agreement, and certain recently incurred DURECT expenses the parties negotiated for Innocoll to reimburse. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized $4.1 million as collaborative research and development and other revenue, $1.1 million as product revenue, and a reduction of $0.1 million in net equipment. At December 31, 2021, we included $5.3 million due from Innocoll in accounts receivable on our balance sheet; these funds were received in January 2022. In August 2022, we were issued a new patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, extending U.S. patent coverage of POSIMIR to at least 2041, resulting in an $8.0 million milestone payment by Innocoll to the Company. In September 2022, Innocoll launched POSIMIR in the U.S., triggering a $2.0 million milestone payment to the Company for the first commercial sale of POSIMIR. As the commercial launch of POSIMIR progresses, we will also earn tiered, low double-digit to mid-teen royalties on net product sales of POSIMIR in the U.S. We may earn additional milestone payments up to $122.0 million in the aggregate, depending on the achievement of certain commercial, regulatory and intellectual property milestones with respect to POSIMIR. Pursuant to the terms of the Innocoll Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Innocoll Agreement, Innocoll is responsible for expenses relating to the manufacturing, development and commercialization of POSIMIR in the U.S.

PERSERIS (risperidone)
 In September 2017, we entered into an agreement with Indivior, under which we assigned to Indivior certain patents that may provide further intellectual property protection for PERSERIS, Indivior’s extended-release injectable suspension for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. In consideration for such assignment, Indivior made non-refundable upfront and milestone payments to DURECT totaling $17.5 million. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement with Indivior, DURECT receives quarterly earn-out payments that are based on a single-digit percentage of U.S. net sales of PERSERIS into 2026. Indivior commercially launched PERSERIS in the U.S. in February 2019.

ORADUR-ADHD Program
 We developed a proprietary drug product for the treatment of ADHD called Methydur in collaboration with Orient Pharma, a diversified multinational pharmaceutical, healthcare and consumer products company with headquarters in Taiwan. We have licensed worldwide Methydur rights to Orient Pharma and they launched Methydur commercially in Taiwan in September 2020. Orient Pharma may seek commercialization partners in other countries throughout the world, including China and the U.S. We receive a single-digit royalty on sales of Methydur by Orient Pharma or its commercialization partners as well as potential milestones and sub-license fees.
 Drug Delivery Technologies and Programs
 Our drug delivery technologies are designed to deliver the right drug to the right place, in the right amount and at the right time to treat a variety of chronic, acute and episodic diseases and conditions. We aim to improve therapy for a given disease or patient population by controlling the rate and duration of drug administration. In addition, if advantageous for the therapy, our technologies can target the delivery of the drug to its intended site of action.

Our technologies are suitable for providing long-term drug therapy because they can often store highly concentrated, stabilized drugs in a small volume and protect the drug from degradation by the body. This, in combination with the ability to continuously deliver desired doses of a drug, can extend the therapeutic value of a wide variety of drugs, including, in some cases, those which would otherwise be ineffective, too unstable, too potent or cause adverse side effects. In some cases, delivering the drug directly to the intended site of action can improve efficacy while minimizing unwanted side effects elsewhere in the body, which may limit the long-term use of many drugs. Our technologies may thus provide better therapy for chronic diseases or conditions, or for certain acute conditions where longer drug dosing is required or advantageous, by replacing multiple injection therapy or oral dosing, improving drug efficacy, reducing side effects and ensuring dosing compliance. Our technology may thereby improve patients’ quality of life by eliminating more repetitive treatments, reducing dependence on caregivers and allowing patients to lead more independent lives.
 We currently focus our drug delivery technology efforts around our SABER® and CLOUD Bioerodible Injectable Depot Systems. SABER uses a high viscosity base component, such as sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB), to provide controlled release of a drug. When the high viscosity SAIB is formulated with drug, biocompatible excipients and other additives, the resulting formulation is easily injectable with standard syringes and needles. After injection of a SABER formulation, the excipients diffuse away over time, leaving a viscous depot which provides controlled sustained release of drug. CLOUD is a class of bioerodible injectable depot technology which generally does not contain SAIB but includes various other release rate modifying excipients and/or bioerodible polymers to achieve the delivery of drugs for periods of days to months from a single injection.
 The SABER technology is the basis of POSIMIR (described above).

Our Strategy
 Our objective is to develop multiple pharmaceutical products that address significant unmet medical needs and improve patients’ quality of life. To achieve this objective, our strategy includes the following key elements:
 Complete Clinical Development and Seek Regulatory Approval of Larsucosterol for the Treatment of AH. We are currently enrolling our Phase 2b clinical trial (AHFIRM). We expect to complete enrollment in the second quarter of 2023 and to report topline results in the second half of 2023. If the AHFIRM trial is successful, we intend to meet with the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities to discuss registration.
 Maximize the Commercial Potential of Larsucosterol in AH. We intend to build a highly specialized commercial organization to support the commercialization of larsucosterol, if approved, in the United States. We believe this market can be effectively addressed with a modest-sized commercial organization, including a hospital-focused sales force focused on hospitals. We may also seek strategic collaborations to commercialize larsucosterol outside the United States.
Apply Our Drug Development Expertise to New Chemical Entities Derived from Our Epigenetic Regulator Program. We have assembled a core team of employees with considerable experience in drug development, and it is our intent to leverage their capabilities by developing product candidates utilizing expertise from our Epigenetic Regulator Program. We may develop these new chemical entities ourselves or with partners.
Expand Development Pipeline by Identifying Potential New Indications for Epigenetic Regulator Programs Focused on Conditions with High Unmet Need. We believe our Epigenetic Regulator Program has the potential to address many of the diseases and disorders that present great challenges to medicine including acute organ injury, metabolic disorders, and other acute and chronic conditions. Our current efforts focus on exploiting our Epigenetic Regulator Program through which we have identified new chemical entities, including larsucosterol, our lead compound, that may have utility in conditions such as acute organ injuries, including AH, and chronic metabolic/lipid disorders, including NASH.
 Enable Product Development Through Strategic Agreements. We believe that entering into selective strategic collaborations and other arrangements with respect to our product development programs and technology can enhance the success of our product development and commercialization, leverage and exploit the value of our intellectual property portfolio, mitigate our risk and enable us to
better manage our operating costs. Additionally, such collaborations and arrangements enable us to leverage investment by third parties and reduce our net cash burn, while retaining significant economic rights.
Strategic Agreements
 We have entered into the following strategic collaboration and other key agreements:
 Innocoll Pharmaceuticals Limited. In December 2021, we entered into the Innocoll Agreement, pursuant to which, we granted to Innocoll an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize POSIMIR in the U.S. with respect to all uses and applications in humans. The Innocoll Agreement provides for the assignment of our supply agreement with a contract manufacturing organization to Innocoll and also provides Innocoll with the right, within the U.S., to expand the approved indications of POSIMIR. We retain, outside the United States, all of the global rights to POSIMIR. Innocoll paid us an initial non-refundable, upfront fee of $4.0 million as well as a fee in the amount of $1.3 million primarily to cover the manufacturing supplies and excipients and certain equipment transferred to Innocoll pursuant to the terms of the Innocoll Agreement, and certain recently incurred DURECT expenses the parties negotiated for Innocoll to reimburse. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized $4.1 million as collaborative research and development and other revenue, $1.1 million as product revenue, and a reduction of $0.1 million in net equipment. At December 31, 2021, we included $5.3 million due from Innocoll in accounts receivable on our balance sheet; these funds were received in January 2022. In August 2022, we were issued a new patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, extending U.S. patent coverage of POSIMIR to at least 2041, resulting in an $8.0 million milestone payment by Innocoll to the Company. In September 2022, Innocoll launched POSIMIR in the U.S., triggering a $2.0 million milestone payment to the Company for the first commercial sale of POSIMIR. As the commercial launch of POSIMIR progresses, we will receive tiered, low double-digit to mid-teen royalties on net product sales of POSIMIR in the U.S. We may earn additional milestone payments up to $122.0 million in the aggregate, depending on the achievement of certain commercial, regulatory and intellectual property milestones with respect to POSIMIR. Thus, we recognized $10.0 million of milestone revenue under the agreement with Innocoll during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Innocoll Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Innocoll Agreement, Innocoll is responsible for expenses relating to the manufacturing, development and commercialization of POSIMIR in the United States. The Innocoll Agreement includes customary representations and warranties on behalf of us and Innocoll, including representations as to the licensed intellectual property, regulatory matters and compliance with applicable laws. The Innocoll Agreement also provides for certain mutual indemnities for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants.
Virginia Commonwealth University Intellectual Property Foundation. In December 2012, we entered into an exclusive in-license and research and development agreement with the Virginia Commonwealth University Intellectual Property Foundation regarding certain new chemical entities under development through our Epigenetic Regulator Program, including larsucosterol. Under this licensing arrangement, we agreed to undertake certain efforts to bring licensed products to market, pay for prosecution of related patents and report on progress to VCU. In addition, we are obligated to pay low single-digit percentage patent royalties on net sales of licensed products, subject to annual minimum payments and additional milestone payments. This license includes rights to ten patent families. We may terminate this agreement at any time by written notice, and VCU may terminate this agreement by written notice if there is an uncured material breach.

Indivior UK Ltd. In September 2017, we entered into an agreement with Indivior, under which we assigned to Indivior certain patents that may provide further intellectual property protection for PERSERIS, Indivior’s extended-release injectable suspension for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. In consideration for such assignment, Indivior made non-refundable upfront and milestone payments to DURECT totaling $17.5 million. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement with Indivior, DURECT receives quarterly earn-out payments that are based on a single digit percentage of U.S. net sales of PERSERIS into 2026. Indivior commercially launched PERSERIS in the U.S. in February 2019. We also receive a non-exclusive right under the assigned patents to develop and commercialize certain risperidone-containing products and products that do not contain risperidone or buprenorphine. The agreement contains customary representations, warranties and indemnities of the parties.
Commercial Product Lines
 ALZET
 The ALZET product line consists of miniature, implantable osmotic pumps and accessories used for research in mice, rats and other laboratory animals. These pumps are neither approved nor intended for human use. ALZET pumps continuously deliver drugs, hormones and other test agents at controlled rates from one day to six weeks without the need for external connections, frequent handling or repeated dosing. In laboratory research, these infusion pumps can be used for systemic administration when implanted under the skin or in the body. They can be attached to a catheter for IV, intracerebral, or intra-arterial infusion or for targeted delivery, where the effects of a drug or test agent are localized in a particular tissue or organ. The wide use and applications of the ALZET product line is evidenced by the more than 21,000 scientific references that now exist.
 LACTEL® Absorbable Polymers
 On December 31, 2020, we signed an Asset Purchase Agreement with Evonik Corporation (Evonik), pursuant to which Evonik purchased certain assets related to our LACTEL Absorbable Polymers product line. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Evonik paid us approximately $15.1 million and also agreed to assume certain liabilities with respect to the transferred assets and assembled workforce.
Marketing and Sales
 Historically, we have established strategic distribution and marketing alliances for our product candidates to leverage the established sales organizations that certain pharmaceutical companies have in markets we are targeting. In the future, we may elect to build our own commercial, sales and marketing capability in order to capture more of the economic value of certain products that we may develop. If we choose to enter into third-party collaborations to commercialize our pharmaceutical product candidates, we may in the future enter into these alliances under circumstances that allow us to participate in the sales and marketing of these products. We will continue to pursue strategic alliances and collaborators from time to time consistent with our strategy to leverage the established sales organizations of third-party collaborators.
We market and sell our ALZET product line through a direct sales force in the U.S. and through a network of distributors outside of the U.S.
Suppliers
 We purchase the larsucosterol drug substance from a third-party manufacturer and larsucosterol clinical trial materials from another third-party manufacturer. As needed, we purchase sucrose acetate isobutyrate, a raw material for our SABER-based pharmaceutical systems, including Methydur, POSIMIR, and ORADUR. We expect that we will continue to be able to obtain sufficient supply of these raw materials to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We do not have in place long term supply agreements with respect to all of the components of any of our pharmaceutical product candidates, however, and are subject to the risk that we may not be able to procure all required components in adequate quantities with acceptable quality, within acceptable time frames or at reasonable cost.
Customers
 Our product revenues principally are derived from sales of the ALZET product line to academic and pharmaceutical industry researchers, and from the sale of certain key excipients that are included in POSIMIR, Methydur Sustained Release Capsules, and other products. Until such time that we are able to
bring our pharmaceutical product candidates to market, if at all, we expect these to be our principal sources of product revenue. We also receive revenue from collaborative research and development arrangements with our third-party collaborators and earn out revenue from our patent purchase agreement. In 2022, Innocoll accounted for 52% of our total revenue. In 2021, Innocoll accounted for 37% of our total revenue.
Manufacturing
 The process for manufacturing our pharmaceutical product candidates is technically complex, requires special skills, and must be performed in qualified facilities. We have entered into development and commercial manufacturing agreements with third parties for the manufacture of larsucosterol and POSIMIR (now assigned to Innocoll). In addition, we have a small multi-discipline manufacturing facility in California that we have used to manufacture research and clinical supplies of several of our pharmaceutical product candidates under good manufacturing practice (“GMP”), including larsucosterol dosage forms and POSIMIR. In the future, we may develop additional manufacturing capabilities for our pharmaceutical product candidates and components to meet our demands and those of our third-party collaborators by contracting with third party manufacturers and by potentially constructing additional manufacturing space at our current facilities in California. We manufacture our ALZET product line and certain key components for POSIMIR and Methydur at one of our California facilities.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents, to protect trade secrets, to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary molecules and technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. As of March 3, 2023, we owned or exclusively in-licensed over 25 unexpired issued U.S. patents and over 170 unexpired issued foreign patents (which include granted European patent rights that have been validated in various EU member states). In addition, we have over 30 pending U.S. patent applications and over 190 foreign applications pending in Europe, Australia, Japan, Canada and other countries.
 The patent status of our most advanced drug candidates is as follows:
 Our Epigenetic Regulator Program includes ten in-licensed patent families and ten patent families solely owned by us. Seven patent families each include at least one granted patent that could provide protection until at least 2026, 2032, 2033, 2034, 2035, 2037 and 2037, respectively. The other patent families include pending patent applications, which if granted, could result in patents providing protection until at least 2037 to 2043. Patent terms are potentially subject to terminal disclaimers as well as patent term adjustments and extensions. Of the twenty patent families covering larsucosterol and/or other molecules in the Epigenetic Regulator Program, two were only filed in the United States, and the other eighteen have been filed or likely will be filed both in the U.S. and internationally. Since larsucosterol is an endogenous molecule, patent claims directed to larsucosterol compositions of matter may be more difficult to maintain or enforce in the United States under Myriad Genetics and other recent court decisions. One of the U.S. patents issued before Myriad Genetics, and nine of the larsucosterol U.S. patents issued after Myriad Genetics. The granted claims in the U.S. include both composition of matter and method of treatment claims. There can be no assurance that the pending patent applications will be granted. Further, there can be no assurance that VCU will not attempt to terminate their license to us, which termination could result in the loss of our rights to these patent families.
 In the United States, POSIMIR is covered by four patent families. Three patent families include granted patents that could provide protection until 2025, 2026 and 2041, respectively. The other patent family includes a pending patent application, which if granted, could result in a patent expiring in 2042. In Europe, POSIMIR is covered by two granted patents with one that could expire in 2025 and one that could expire in 2026. The families that could provide protection until at least 2041 and 2042, respectively, have either been filed or will likely be filed in Europe.

Proprietary rights relating to our planned and potential products will be protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents owned by or licensed to us may not afford protection against competitors, and our pending patent applications now or hereafter filed by or licensed to us may not result in patents being issued. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, their enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. Our patents or patent applications, or those licensed to us, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted thereunder may not provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patent, which could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and, consequently, our operating results and financial position.
 Because patent applications in the U.S. are typically maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months after filing and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make inventions or file for protection of inventions set forth in our patents or patent applications.
 Our planned or potential products may be covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, in which case we would need to obtain a license to continue developing or marketing these products. Any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not obtain any required licenses, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to design around these patents, or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed. Litigation may be necessary to defend against or assert such claims of infringement, to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us, or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. In addition, interference, derivation, post-grant oppositions, and similar proceedings may be necessary to determine rights to inventions in our patents and patent applications. Litigation or similar proceedings could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These efforts by us may not be successful.
 We may rely, in certain circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain contractors. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and, among other things, the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. We believe that our products in development will be regulated as drugs by the FDA rather than as biologics or devices.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 The standard process required by the FDA under the new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDCA”) before our products in development may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 •preclinical laboratory and animal tests performed under current good laboratory practices;
 •submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee before each human clinical trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with IND regulations, code of good clinical practice (“GCP”), requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product candidates in their intended uses;
 •submission of an NDA to the FDA for approval of commercial marketing and sale, or of an NDA supplement for approval of a new indication if the proposed pharmaceutical product candidate is already approved for another indication;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with current good manufacturing practice and current GCPs;
 •if the FDA convenes an advisory committee, satisfactory completion of the advisory committee review;
 •FDA approval of an NDA; and
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
 Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of NDAs: (1) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (section 505(b)(1)); (2) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference (section 505(b)(2)); and (3) an application that contains information to show that the proposed pharmaceutical product candidate is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product (section 505(j)). We expect that our drug candidates deriving from our Epigenetic Regulator Program will be evaluated for approval after submission of an NDA under section 505(b)(1).
 The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Preclinical development of a drug candidate can take several years to complete, with no guarantee that an IND based on those studies will become effective to even permit clinical testing to begin. Even though several of our pharmaceutical product candidates utilize active drug ingredients that are commercially marketed in the United States in other dosage forms, we need to establish safety and effectiveness of those active ingredients in the formulation and dosage forms that we are developing.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product candidate. We then submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may begin human clinical trials. Each subsequent new clinical protocol must also be submitted to the FDA under the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-Day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as
outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB at each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trials must review and approve any clinical study as well as the related informed consent forms and authorization forms that permit us to use individually identifiable health information of study participants.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap:
 •Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
 •Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population with the target disease or condition in clinical trials to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 •Phase 3: When Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken and the drug is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product candidate for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product candidate, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 In the case of product candidates for severe diseases, such as chronic pain, or life-threatening diseases such as cancer, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the target diseases or conditions rather than in healthy volunteers. Since these patients already have the target disease or condition, these studies may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase 2 trials, and thus these trials are frequently referred to as Phase 1/2 clinical trials or Phase 1b trials. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials of our pharmaceutical product candidates in development within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the IRB or the sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. During the clinical development of product candidates, sponsors frequently meet and consult with the FDA to ensure that the design of their studies will likely provide data both sufficient and relevant for later regulatory review; however, no assurance of approvability can be given by the FDA.
 
NDA Review and Approval Processes
 Assuming successful completion of all testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the product. Submission of an NDA may require the payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, and although the agency has defined user fee goals for the time in which to respond to sponsor applications, there can be no assurance that the FDA will act in any particular timeframe. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical trials be conducted. Even if such data is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. An NDA may be approved with significant restrictions on its labeling, marketing and distribution under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy or otherwise that could restrict the commercial applications of a product or impose costly procedures in connection with the commercialization or use of the product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not maintained or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. Requirements for additional Phase 4 studies (post approval marketing studies) to confirm safety and effectiveness in a broader commercial use population may be imposed as a condition of marketing approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to require changes in
labeling or to prevent further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Any comparative claims comparing a product to other dosage forms or competitive products typically need to be supported by two adequate and well-controlled head-to-head clinical trials.
 Satisfaction of FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially, based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product and of the disease or condition. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approval for any of our pharmaceutical products under development on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Targets and pathways identified in vitro may be determined to be less relevant in clinical studies and results in animal model studies may not be predictive of human clinical results. Furthermore, data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Evolving safety concerns can result in the imposition of new requirements for expensive and time-consuming tests, such as for QT interval cardiotoxicity testing. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, any problems associated with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Any pharmaceutical products that we may develop and obtain approval for would also be subject to adverse findings of the active drug ingredients being marketed in different dosage forms and formulations. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business. Marketing our pharmaceutical products abroad will require similar regulatory approvals and is subject to similar risks. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 There are several FDA programs intended to help facilitate the development of new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Under a Fast Track designation, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
 A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Additionally, a product candidate that is being studied for safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that it may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials with due diligence and, under the Food and Drug
Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (“FDORA”), the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA generally requires that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.
 A product may also be eligible for receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy designation under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”). The Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the FDA’s review of a potential new drug for serious or life-threatening diseases where “preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.” The designation of a drug as a Breakthrough Therapy provides the same benefits as are available under the Fast Track program, as well as intensive FDA guidance on the product’s development program. If a drug is designated as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA will provide more intensive guidance on the drug development program and expedite its review. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but they may expedite the development or approval process.
 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or 200,000 or more individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, for seven years. These circumstances are an inability to supply the drug in sufficient quantities or a situation in which a new formulation of the orphan drug has shown superior safety or efficacy or a major contribution to patient care. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains earlier approval of the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If we pursue marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan drug designation we have received, we may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union (“EU”) has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
 
Post-Approval Regulation
 Any pharmaceutical products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the product or the active pharmaceutical ingredient or other components of the product. The FDA may also require post-approval clinical or non-clinical trials. Drug
manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with good manufacturing practices, which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the GMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.
 The FDCA strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples. The FDA has actively enforced regulations prohibiting the marketing of products for unapproved uses, and federal and state authorities are also actively litigating against sponsors who promote their drugs for unapproved uses under various fraud and abuse and false claims act statutes. We and our products are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products are or will be marketed. Any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities. We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
 The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of health care costs in the U.S. and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
The Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") regulates chemical compounds as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. Certain active ingredients in ORADUR-Methylphenidate are listed by the DEA as Schedule II under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Consequently, their manufacture, research, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of oversight and regulation. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription. Furthermore, the amount of Schedule II substances we can obtain for clinical trials and commercial distribution is limited by the DEA and our quota may not be sufficient to complete clinical trials or meet commercial demand. There is a risk that DEA regulations may interfere with the supply of the drugs used in our clinical trials, and, in the future, our ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to meet commercial demand, which could negatively impact us and our collaborators.
 
Other Healthcare Laws
 In addition to FDA and DEA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, other foreign, federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti‑kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws.
 The U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti‑Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor
does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case‑by‑case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti‑kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payor, including commercial insurers.
 The federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMMS”), information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), certain non-physician providers (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified-nurse midwives), and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
There are federal price reporting laws, which require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, and such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on approved products.
 Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales, and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing information and marketing expenditures or which require tracking gifts, compensation and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare professionals and entities ; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Finally, the Physician Self-Referral (“Stark”) Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of “designated health services” with whom the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement, unless a statutory or regulatory exception applies.
 Violations of any of these laws and other applicable healthcare fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. In the United States, no uniform policy exists for coverage and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products among third-party payors. Therefore, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved.
 Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing obligation imposed on patients. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process will often require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, which can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.
 Moreover, as a condition of participating in, and having products covered under, certain federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, we may become subject to federal laws and regulations that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as Medicaid Average Manufacturer Price (“AMP”), and Best Price, Medicare Average Sales Price, the 340B Ceiling Price and Non-Federal AMP reported to the Department of Veteran Affairs, and with respect to Medicaid, pay statutory rebates on utilization of manufacturers’ products by Medicaid beneficiaries. Compliance with such laws and regulations require significant resources and any findings of non-compliance may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.
 
Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In the United States, by way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), was enacted in the United States. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our potential product candidates, the Affordable Care Act: established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; created a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; established a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.

There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress. Thus, the Affordable Care Act will remain in effect in its current form. However, it is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be subject to additional judicial or Congressional challenges in the future.
Further, the Affordable Care Act has been subject to various health reform measures. For example, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, the Biden administration issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025 and includes several measures intended to lower the cost of prescription drugs and related healthcare reforms. Specifically, the IRA authorizes and directs the Department of Health and Human Services to set drug price caps for certain high-cost Medicare Part B and Part D qualified drugs, with the initial list of drugs to be selected by September 1, 2023, and the first year of maximum price applicability to begin in 2026. The IRA further authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers that increase the price of certain Medicare Part B and Part D drugs faster than the rate of inflation. Finally, the IRA creates significant changes to the Medicare Part D benefit design by capping Part D beneficiaries’ annual out-of-pocket spending at $2,000 and eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program, both beginning in 2025, by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost through a newly established manufacturer discount program. The implementation of government imposed cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved. It is unclear how any such challenges and other litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the current U.S. presidential administration will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken, except for a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 and limited reductions to 1% from April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic with the 2% payment reduction having resumed on July 1, 2022. Following the resumption of the sequester, under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024.
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the Affordable Care Act, which has increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the program as well as a new methodology by which rebates are owed for drugs that are
inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected. We are also subject to federal and state false claims acts, as well as federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. Increased scrutiny of health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in such government healthcare programs.
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product and medical device pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and medical devices to purchase and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
 We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been adopted and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved or cleared product and product candidates, if approved, and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we or our partners are slow or unable to adapt to new requirements or policies, or if we or our partners are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our products and product candidates may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained, which would reduce the likelihood that we may achieve or sustain profitability, or be able to enter attractive collaboration agreements, which would adversely affect our business.
 
Foreign Regulation
 Outside the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the EU regional registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one EU member state. If the competent regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy has been presented, a marketing authorization may be granted. This foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above and may also include additional risks.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-US countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (“CTA”) much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, a CTA must be submitted for each trial to the competent health authority and to independent ethics committees by national procedure for a single country trial or by EMA submission portal Clinical Trials Information System for a multinational study. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with the requirements in the concerned countries, clinical trial development may proceed in those countries and are conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (“MAA”). This application is similar to the NDA in the United States, with the exception of, among other things, regional and/or country-specific document requirements. Drugs can be authorized in the EU by using the centralized, mutual recognition, decentralized or national authorization procedures described below.

The EMA implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human drugs to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EU. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the EU. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days (excluding clock stoppages for requests by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) for additional written or oral information to be provided by the applicant). A positive opinion on the MAA by the CHMP then needs to be endorsed by the European Commission within approximately 67 days. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, in which case the EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150 days (excluding clock stops) and the opinion issued thereafter.
 The mutual recognition procedure (“MRP”) for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing authorizations within the EU. The MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by EU member states of their respective national marketing authorizations. Based on a marketing authorization in the reference member state, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other member states. In such case, the reference member state shall update its existing assessment report about the drug. After the assessment is completed, copies of the report are sent to all member states, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states then recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement.
 Should any member state refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, the member states shall make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee is then forwarded to the Commission, for the start of the decision making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human Medicinal Products or Veterinary Medicinal Products, as appropriate.
 Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries outside of the United States, including the EU. The orphan legislation in the EU is available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons, are life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and for which no satisfactory treatment is authorized. The market exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product does not justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as non-EU countries in Eastern Europe, Middle-East, Latin America, Japan or other countries in Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Competition
 We may face competition from other companies in numerous industries including pharmaceuticals, medical devices and drug delivery.
Competition for larsucosterol, if approved, will depend on the specific indication(s) for which larsucosterol is approved. Akaza Bioscience Ltd., Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Immuron Ltd., Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mallinckrodt plc, Novartis Pharma AG, PharmaKing Co. Ltd, Surrozen, Inc., and others have development plans for products to treat AH. Our current and potential competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection or commercializing products before us. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us. Acquisitions of, or investments in, competing pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by large corporations could increase such competitors’ financial, marketing, manufacturing and other resources.

 Competition for our ALZET product line primarily consists of customers choosing to utilize delivery methods for their research projects other than an osmotic pump. We also face competition for our ALZET product line from other companies including low-cost foreign competitors.
 Any pharmaceutical products we develop will compete in highly competitive markets. Many of our potential competitors in these markets have greater development, financial, manufacturing, marketing, and sales resources than we do and we cannot be certain that they will not succeed in developing products or technologies which will render our technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, many of those potential competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in their respective fields.

 Human Capital
Our approach to human capital resource management starts with our mission to advance novel and potentially lifesaving investigational therapies derived from our Epigenetic Regulator Program. Our industry exists in a complex regulatory environment. The unique demands of our industry, together with the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of innovative medicines, require talent that is highly educated and/or has significant industry experience. Additionally, for certain key functions, we require specific scientific expertise to oversee and conduct R&D activities and the complex manufacturing requirements for biopharmaceutical products.
The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and recruiting and retaining employees is critical to the continued success of our business. We are an equal opportunity employer and we are fundamentally committed to creating and maintaining a work environment in which employees are treated with respect and dignity. All human resources policies, practices and actions related to hiring, promotion, compensation, benefits and termination are administered in accordance with the principal of equal employment opportunity, meaning that they are made on the basis of individual skills, knowledge, abilities, job performance and other legitimate criteria and without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, age, mental or physical disability, genetic information, any veteran status, any military status or application for military service, or membership in any other category protected under applicable law. By focusing on employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our clinical trials, our pipeline, our platform technologies, business and operations, and also protect the long-term interests of our stockholders. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain a diverse group of employees.

Our base pay program aims to compensate management and staff members relative to the value of the contributions of their role, which takes into account the skills, knowledge and abilities required to perform each position, as well as the experience brought to the job. We also provide annual incentive programs to reward our management team and staff members in alignment with achievement of Company-wide goals that are established annually and designed to drive aspects of our strategic priorities that support and advance our strategy across our Company. Our management team and staff members are eligible for the grant of equity awards under our long-term incentive program that are designed to align the experience of these staff with that of our stockholders. All management team and staff members also participate in a regular performance measurement process that aligns pay to performance and through which they receive performance and development feedback.
Our benefit programs are also generally broad-based, promote health and overall well-being and emphasize saving for retirement. All management team and regular staff members are eligible to participate in the same core health and welfare and retirement savings plans. Other employee benefits include employee stock purchase plan, medical plans, dental plans, vacation and sick-pay plans, employee assistance programs, flexible spending accounts, life and accident insurance and short and long-term disability benefits.
Our Compensation Committee provides oversight of our compensation plans, policies and programs.
 As of March 3, 2023, we had 79 employees, including 43 in research and development, 10 in manufacturing and 26 in selling, general and administrative. At least 37 of our employees have advanced degrees of some sort (e.g., MD, PhD, DVM, JD, MBA). The Company strives for gender diversity and diversity beyond gender throughout the organization. Of our employees, 35% are male and 65% are female. From time to time, we also employ independent contractors to support our research, development and administrative organizations. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
