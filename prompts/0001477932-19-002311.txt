3. | Secure global distribution channels for our product lines; and 
4. | Establish partnerships with large and specialty pharmaceutical companies and/or biotechnology companies to collaboratively develop and/or commercialize certain products in our portfolio.

Our Research and Development Strategies
 
Our management team has implemented a business-minded and cost-conscious approach to product research and development by focusing on development of bio-cannabis nutraceuticals and selling the finished products into markets where regulations permit. We will use contract development and manufacturing organizations on a fee for service basis to perform any research or development that is required.
Our Platform Technologies
 
BiPhasix Transdermal Drug Delivery Technology (Topical Platform)
 
We have acquired worldwide rights from Altum Pharmaceuticals Inc. for its patented topical transdermal drug delivery technology platform, or BiPhasix, which we will use for the delivery and commercialization of cannabinoid, CBD and THC-based products. The BiPhasix technology has the potential to deliver drugs less invasively than by injections. It also has the potential to topically deliver therapeutic amounts of drugs with better absorption rates, where creams, ointments or conventional liposomes have not been effective.
Thrudermic Transdermal Nanotechnology (Topical Platform)
 
We have acquired the worldwide rights to Thrudermic’s patented Transdermal Nanotechnology for the development and commercialization of transdermal cannabinoids. Developed in Israel, the Thrudermic lipid-based nano dispersion technology for topical cannabinoids uses FDA approved materials. The technology has the ability to specifically formulate individual drugs to control and prolong drug release while maintaining steady therapeutic concentrations, The technology can handle water soluble and water insoluble drugs with no change to the skin morphology, no sensitivity to the digestive system, no pain from injections and no observed adverse reactions.

Solmic Solubilization Drug Delivery Technology (Oral Platform)
 
We will enter into purchase agreements with Solmic GmbH (“Solmic”) for the purchase of Solmic’s oral 1% Micelle solution. Subject to meeting annual minimum order quantities, we will receive worldwide exclusive rights to this product, made with patented Micelle technology.
Ready-To-Infuse Cannabis Technology
 
Pivot’s patented Ready-To-Infuse-Cannabis (“RTIC”) process technology creates precise and repeatable dosing of cannabis by transforming concentrated cannabis oil into a stable, emulsifiable, odorless and flavorless powder form. The derived powder may then be encapsulated and infused for use in beverages, edibles, lotions and additional health and personal care products. The RTIC process is conducive for manufacturing of a wide array of products. 
Solumer Drug Delivery Technology (Oral Platform)
 
We have acquired the worldwide rights to Formulex’s Solumer Technology for the oral delivery of cannabinoids, such as CBD and THC, with improved bioavailability. The Solumer Technology allows to convert the cannabinoids to powder for tablets and capsules and the powder can be dispersed in liquids to give a clear solution that is colorless, and flavorless for beverage applications. 
Our Pharmaceutical Product Development 
 
In addition to our bio-cannabis nutraceutical product pipeline, we have the opportunity develop a pharmaceutical pipeline in the future, financing permitting.

Licensing
 
Health Canada - Standard Processor and Sale for Medical Purposes Licensing
 
The Cannabis Act and its Regulations provide, among other things, the framework for legal access to cannabis and control and regulate its production, distribution and sale. The oversight of the cannabis supply chain is a shared responsibility across federal and provincial and territorial governments, municipalities, industry and other stakeholders. One of Health Canada’s responsibilities is to provide the licensing and oversight framework for legal production of cannabis. Under this framework, a person is required to obtain a license issued by Health Canada in order to conduct various activities with cannabis. Applicants and license holders are responsible for compliance with the Cannabis Act and its Regulations as well as compliance with other applicable federal, provincial and territorial legislation and municipal by-laws.
 
The Cannabis Act establishes that an application for a license must be submitted to Health Canada in the form and manner specified by the Minister of Health and must include the information required by the Minister. We have applied for a Standard Processor and Sale for Medical Purposes license from Health Canada. Initially, we applied for a Health Canada Dealer’s License in March 2018 but transitioned to a Standard Processor license upon the introduction of the Cannabis Act in October 2018. We are currently awaiting Health Canada’s approval of the aforementioned license.
 
Manufacturing
 
Canada
 
We will manufacture our products at a 50,000 square foot facility located in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Quebec. Half of this facility is operated by our contract manufacturer, Bio V Pharma Inc. (“Bio V”). On a fee-for-service basis, Bio V will manufacture products for our Canadian and international customers. The other half of the building will be operated by us, which focus will be on the manufacturing of edibles, including but not limited to cannabis-infused beverages. This facility at Dollard-des-Ormeax will fall under our pending Health Canada Standard Processor and Sale for Medical Purposes license. 
 
In addition, we also recently executed a letter of intent with Pharmascience Inc. (“Pharmascience”), a large generics manufacturer located in Quebec, Canada. Upon completion of a definitive agreement, Pharmascience will provide contract development and manufacturing services to Pivot on a fee-for-service basis. 
 
United States
 
We have leased a 6,000 square foot facility in Costa Mesa’s “Measure X” zone which will serve as our manufacturing hub for the California market. The California Department of Public Health has issued our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pivot Naturals, a Temporary Manufacturing License for adult and medicinal use cannabis products (Type N:Infusion). In addition, the Bureau of Cannabis Control (California) has issued Pivot Naturals a Temporary Adult-Use and Medicinal - Distributor-Transport Only License. 
 
We plan on relying on contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities for large‑scale commercialization. These contract manufacturers will be subject to extensive government regulations. Regulatory authorities in the markets that we intend to serve require that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current GMP as set by the FDA. In this regard, we plan to engage only contract manufacturers who have the capability to manufacture products in compliance with current GMP in bulk quantities for commercialization. We also intend to safeguard our intellectual property when working with contract manufacturers by working only with manufacturers who in our estimation have a strong track record of safeguarding confidential information and who are willing to enter into agreements with us that impose upon them strict intellectual property protection measures.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
We continue to build and expand our global sales, marketing and distribution channels. Upon receipt of our Standard Processor and Medical Sales license, we will seek supply agreements with individual Canadian provincial authorities to serve our Canadian customers. In the European Union, we will supplement existing distribution relationships, such as our relationship with S.T.U. GmbH, to increase our customer base. In California, we will engage wholesale distributors to bring our products to customers. In addition, we have executed an agreement with Shopify Inc. to develop our e-commerce solution for the Canadian market. As regulations evolve and more countries legalize the use of cannabis, we will continue to add to our sales and distribution channels.

Competition
 
The burgeoning cannabis industry has and will continue to attract many new entrants. We believe that we will be able to differentiate ourselves in the cannabis market by developing products that are IP-protected, bioavailable and stable. Most products currently on the market are of inferior quality and have poor bioavailability. Once consumers become educated on different product attributes, we believe they will likely seek out products, such as ours, that offer science-based solutions.
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our products and product candidates by obtaining and maintaining a strong proprietary position both in the United States and in other countries. To develop and maintain our proprietary position, we will rely on patent protection, regulatory protection, trade secrets, know‑how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities.
 
It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, contractors, or scientific and other advisors, to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. These agreements provide that all inventions related to our business that are conceived by the individual during our relationship shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
 
Government Regulations
 
Our current and future operations and research and development activities are or will be subject to various laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct or plan to conduct our business, including but not limited to the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and potentially certain member countries from the European Union. These laws and regulations govern the research, development, sale and marketing of cannabis products, taxes, labor standards, occupational health and safety, toxic substances, chemical products and materials, waste management and other matters relating to the pharmaceutical industry. We may require permits, registrations or other authorizations to maintain our operations and to carry out our future research and development activities, and these permits, registrations or authorizations will be subject to revocation, modification and renewal.
 
Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with lease conditions, regulatory requirements and the provisions of required permits, registrations or other authorizations, and violators may be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines, injunctions, or both. The failure to obtain or maintain a required permit may also result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, and third parties may have the right to sue to enforce compliance.
 
We expect to be able to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and do not believe that such compliance will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. We have obtained and intend to obtain all permits, licenses and approvals required by all applicable regulatory agencies to maintain our current operations and to carry out our future research and development activities. We are not aware of any material violations of permits, licenses or approvals issued with respect to our operations, and we believe that we will continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
 
Subsidiaries
 
We own 100% of the outstanding common stock of Pivot Green Stream Health Solutions Inc., Pivot Naturals, LLC and Thrudermic, LLC.
 
Employees and Consultants
