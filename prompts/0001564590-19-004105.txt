Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 Saia, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a transportation company headquartered in Johns Creek, Georgia (Saia, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, the Company or Saia). We provide regional and interregional less-than-truckload (LTL) services through a single integrated organization. While more than 97% of our revenue has been derived from transporting LTL shipments, we also offer customers a wide range of other value-added services, including non-asset truckload, expedited and logistics services across North America.
 Founded in 1924, Saia Motor Freight Line, LLC (Saia LTL Freight) is a leading LTL carrier that serves 41 states with plans to complete service coverage in the Northeastern states. Saia LTL Freight specializes in offering its customers a range of regional and interregional LTL services including time-definite and expedited options. Saia LTL Freight primarily provides its customers with solutions for shipments between 100 and 10,000 pounds.
 As of December 31, 2018, Saia LTL Freight operated a network comprised of 166 owned and leased facilities, including three general offices and owned approximately 4,834 tractors and 15,483 trailers, including equipment acquired with capital leases. 
 In May 2017, Saia implemented its strategy to begin serving new markets in the Northeast.  Since that time the Company has opened 10 new terminals in that region.  Over the past five years, Saia has invested more than $800 million in capital expenditures, primarily for real estate, revenue equipment and technology.  These investments have reduced the age of Saia’s fleet and support Saia’s plans for additional volume growth. Saia has also invested substantially in technology, training and business processes to enhance the Company’s ability to monitor and manage customer service, safety, operations and profitability.
 In 2018, Saia generated revenue of $1.65 billion and operating income of $141.2 million. In 2017, Saia generated revenue of $1.40 billion and operating income of $94.7 million.  In 2018, the average Saia LTL Freight shipment weighed approximately 1,352 pounds and traveled an average distance of approximately 837 miles.
 None of our approximately 10,300 employees is represented by a union.
 Industry
 The trucking industry consists of three segments: private fleets and two “for-hire” carrier groups. The private carrier segment consists of fleets owned and operated by shippers who move their own goods. The two “for-hire” carrier groups, truckload and LTL, are based on the typical shipment sizes handled by transportation service companies. Truckload refers to providers generally transporting shipments greater than 10,000 pounds and LTL refers to providers generally transporting shipments less than 10,000 pounds. Saia is primarily an LTL carrier.
 LTL carriers typically pickup numerous shipments, generally ranging from 100 to 10,000 pounds, and consolidate them at carrier-operated service facilities within a certain radius and then transport the shipments from the origin facility to the carrier-operated destination facility and then deliver the shipments to the ultimate destination. As a result, LTL carriers require expansive networks of pickup and delivery operations around local service facilities and shipments are moved between origin and destination often through an intermediate distribution or “breakbulk” facility. Depending on the distance shipped, the LTL segment historically was classified into three subgroups:
  
• | Regional — Average shipment distance is typically less than 1,200 miles with a focus on one- and two-day markets. Regional transportation companies can move shipments directly from the originating facility to their respective destination facility which increases service reliability and avoids costs associated with intermediate handling.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Interregional — Average shipment distance is usually between 1,200 and 1,500 miles with a focus on serving two- and three-day markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
3


 
• | National — Average shipment distance is typically in excess of 1,500 miles with a focus on service in three- to five-day markets. National providers rely on intermediate shipment handling through hub and spoke networks, which require numerous satellite service facilities, multiple distribution facilities and a relay network. To gain service and cost advantages, national providers occasionally ship directly between service facilities reducing intermediate handling or utilize the rail system.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Throughout the years, there has been a blurring of the three subgroups as individual companies are increasingly serving multiple markets. Today, Saia LTL Freight, as well the vast majority of the LTL capacity, services all three markets.
 The truckload segment is the largest portion of the “for-hire” truck transportation market. Truckload carriers primarily transport large shipments from origin to destination with no intermediate handling. 
 Because truckload carriers do not require an expansive network to provide point-to-point service, the overall cost structure of truckload carriers is typically lower and more variable relative to LTL carriers. However, the lack of a network subjects their drivers to extended periods away from home thus resulting in higher driver turnover and periodic driver shortages. The truckload segment is comprised of several major carriers and numerous small entrepreneurial players. At the most basic level, a truckload company can be started with capital for rolling stock (a tractor and a trailer), insurance, a driver and little else. As size becomes a factor, capital is needed for technology, infrastructure and some limited facilities. Saia LTL Freight may participate in the truckload market as a means to fill empty miles in lanes that are not at capacity. Saia also offers its customers the truckload and expedited offerings of its non-asset operations.
 Capital requirements are significantly higher in the traditional LTL segment versus the truckload segment. In the LTL sector, substantial amounts of capital are required for a network of service facilities, shipment handling equipment and revenue equipment (both for city pick-up, delivery and linehaul). In addition, investment in technology has become increasingly important in the LTL segment largely due to the number of transactions and number of customers served on a daily basis. Saia LTL Freight picks up approximately 28,000 shipments per day, each of which has a shipper and consignee, and sometimes a third party payor, all of whom need access to information in a timely manner. More importantly, technology plays a key role in improving customer service, operations efficiency and compliance, safety and yield management. As a result of the significant infrastructure required to operate an LTL carrier, the LTL segment is more concentrated than the truckload segment with the largest LTL players in the national and regional markets. Driver turnover in the LTL sector is significantly lower relative to the truckload sector, although LTL carriers also face periodic driver shortages.
 Business Strategy
 Saia has grown historically through a combination of organic growth and geographic integration or “tuck-in” acquisitions of smaller trucking and logistics companies. More recently Saia has grown largely through organic growth.
 Key elements of our business strategy include:
 Continue to focus on operating safely.
 Our most valuable resource is our employees. It is a corporate priority to continually emphasize the importance of safe operations and to reduce both the frequency and severity of injuries and accidents. This emphasis on safe operations is not only appropriate to protect our employees and our communities but with the continued escalation of commercial insurance and healthcare costs, it is important to maintain and improve stockholder returns. Management expects governmental safety regulations and related enforcement initiatives to increase in the future.

Manage yields and business mix.
 This element of our business strategy involves managing both the pricing process and the mix of customers’ freight in ways that allow our network to operate more profitably. Improvements in the economy coupled with the tightening of available capacity in the industry over the last several years allowed the Company to implement numerous pricing initiatives to increase yield significantly.
 Increase density in existing geographies.
 We gain operating leverage by growing volume and density within existing geography. Depending on pricing and the specific lanes, we estimate that the potential incremental profitability on growth in current markets can be 20 percent or even higher. This improves margins, asset turnover and return on capital. We actively monitor opportunities to add service facilities where there is sufficient market potential. Future volume growth at Saia could result from improvements in the general economy, industry consolidation, geographic expansion and strategic acquisitions, as well as specific sales and marketing initiatives.
 Continue to focus on delivering best-in-class service.
 The foundation of Saia’s growth strategy is consistent delivery of high-quality service. Commitment to service quality is valued by customers and allows us to gain fair compensation for our services and positions us to improve market share.
 Continue to focus on improving operating efficiencies.
 Saia has operating initiatives focused on continuing to improve efficiency. These initiatives help offset a variety of structural cost increases like wages, healthcare benefits, workers’ compensation claims, parts and maintenance expense as well as casualty insurance. We believe Saia continues to be well positioned to manage costs and utilize assets. We believe we will continue to see new opportunities for cost savings.
 Prepare the organization for future growth.
 Our primary focus within organizational development is maintaining strong relationships with our employees. We invest in our employees through internal communication, training programs, recognition programs and providing competitive wages and benefits. We also invest in succession planning initiatives.
 We believe it is also important to invest in technology capabilities and strategic real estate which are designed to position our Company for future growth to meet the increasing demands of the marketplace. We also believe it is important to invest in our tractor and trailer fleet to gain access to new technologies, lower maintenance expenses, achieve improved fuel economy, improve brand image and gain other operating efficiencies.
 Expand portfolio of services in the non-asset market
 While our immediate priority is to improve profitability in our existing portfolio of services, we may pursue additional services to complement our existing non-asset market because it promotes profitability growth and provides additional services for our core LTL customers.
 Expand geographic footprint.
 While our immediate priority is to improve profitability in our existing geography, we plan to further pursue geographic expansion into portions of the Northeastern United States to promote profitable growth and improve our customer value proposition over time. Not only do we plan to invest in new terminals and equipment, but we intend to invest in certain areas of our existing network so that we will be able to handle the increased freight flows we anticipate to and from the new market.  In addition to direct expansion through opening of new facilities, management may consider acquisitions from time to time to help expand geographic reach and density while gaining the business base of the acquired entity.

Seasonality
 Our revenues are subject to seasonal variations. Customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and operating expenses tend to be higher as a percent of revenue in the winter months primarily due to lower capacity utilization and weather effects. Generally, the first quarter is the weakest quarter while the second and third quarters are the strongest quarters in terms of revenue and profit. Quarterly profitability is also impacted by the timing of salary and wage increases and general rate increases which have varied over the years.
Labor
 Most LTL companies, including Saia, and virtually all truckload companies are not subject to collective bargaining agreements.
 In recent years, due to competition for quality employees, the compensation divide between union and non-union carriers has closed dramatically. However, there are still significant differences in benefit costs and work rule flexibility. Benefit costs for union carriers remain significantly above those paid by non-union carriers and union carriers may be subject to certain contingent unfunded multi-employer pension liabilities. In addition, non-union carriers have more work rule flexibility with respect to work schedules, routes and other similar items. Work rule flexibility is a major consideration in the regional LTL sector as flexibility is important to meet the service levels required by customers.
 Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe this provides for better communications and employee relations, stronger future growth prospects, improved efficiencies and customer service capabilities.
 Competition
 Although there has been some tightening of capacity and some industry consolidation, shippers continue to have a wide range of choices. We believe that service quality, price, variety of services offered, geographic coverage, responsiveness and flexibility are the important competitive differentiators.
 Saia focuses on providing LTL services in a highly competitive environment against a wide range of transportation service providers. These competitors include a small number of large, national transportation service providers in the long haul and two-day markets and a larger number of shorter-haul or regional transportation companies in the two-day and overnight markets. Saia also competes in and against several modes of transportation, including LTL, truckload and private fleets. The larger the service area, the greater the barriers to entry into the LTL trucking segment due to the need for additional equipment and operational facilities associated with this coverage. The level of technology investment required and density needed to provide adequate labor and asset utilization make larger-scale entry into the LTL market difficult. Saia also competes with small package carriers, final mile delivery services, railroads and air freight carriers.
 Regulation
 Over the past 39 years, the trucking industry has been substantially deregulated and rates and services are largely free of regulatory controls. Nevertheless, the trucking industry remains subject to regulation by many federal and state governmental agencies, and these authorities have broad powers over matters ranging from the authority to engage in motor carrier operations, motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers, insurance requirements, fuel efficiency and emissions standards, and the transportation and handling of hazardous materials.
 Key areas of regulatory activity include:

Department of Homeland Security.
 The trucking industry is working closely with government agencies to define and implement improved security processes. Federal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and continue to implement anti-terrorism measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) continues to focus on trailer security, driver identification, security clearance and border-crossing procedures. These and other safety and security measures, such as rules for transportation of hazardous materials and cargo-security regulations, could increase the cost of operations, reduce the number of qualified drivers and disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries to customers.
Department of Transportation.
 Motor carrier and freight brokerage operations are subject to safety, insurance and bonding requirements prescribed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and various state agencies.
 Within the DOT, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has issued rules including hours of service regulations that limit the maximum number of hours a driver may be on duty between mandatory off-duty hours.  Our operations have been adjusted to comply with these rules, and while our base operations have not been materially affected, we did experience deterioration in the cost, availability and reliability of purchased transportation. Revisions to these rules could further impact our operations, further tighten the market for qualified drivers and put additional pressure on driver wages and purchased transportation costs. 
 The FMCSA’s Compliance Safety Accountability Program (CSA) could adversely affect our results and ability to maintain or grow our fleet. CSA is an enforcement and compliance model that assesses a motor carrier’s on-road performance and investigation results for a 24-month period using roadside stops and inspections, resulting in safety and performance ratings in the following categories: unsafe driving; hours-of-service compliance; driver fitness; controlled substances/alcohol; vehicle maintenance; hazardous material compliance; and crash indicators. The evaluations are used to rank carriers and individual drivers and to select carriers for audit and other interventions.
 The FMCSA has issued a final rule requiring electronic driver logs be monitored by Electronic Log Devices (ELDs) for many in-state-only drivers and most interstate commercial motor vehicle drivers by no later than December 18, 2017. Drivers who voluntarily used a compliant automatic on-board recording device by the December 18, 2017 deadline were “grandfathered” for two years to give providers time to update their systems to be compliant with the ELD standards. While such regulations could increase the cost of technology, capital equipment and maintenance expenses across our industry, we implemented ELDs company-wide in 2014 prior to the effective date of the ELD standard. 
 The FMCSA has established the Commercial Driver’s License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse, which is a database that will disclose drug and alcohol violations of commercial motor vehicle drivers. The clearinghouse was established by the FMCSA in an effort to help better identify drivers who are prohibited from operating commercial motor vehicles based on drug and alcohol violations and ensure drivers cannot conceal drug and alcohol violations by changing jobs or locations. The clearinghouse is scheduled to launch in early 2020 and will require us to check for current and prospective employee’s drug and alcohol violations and annually query for violations of each driver we currently employ.
 In 2016, the FMCSA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposed regulations that would require vehicles of a certain size to be equipped with a speed limiting device set to a specified speed. A final rule has not yet been implemented and there can be no guarantee as to when, if ever, a final rule requiring speed limiting devices will be implemented, and if implemented, no assurance as to the nature of any such rule and its impact on our fleet and operations. While such regulations could increase the cost of technology, capital equipment and maintenance expenses across our industry, we expect that all our tractors will have the necessary on-board technology systems in place to capture this data by the time the regulations take effect.

Environmental Protection Agency.
 The EPA has issued regulations reducing sulfur content of diesel fuel and reducing engine emissions. These regulations increased the cost of replacing and maintaining trucks. Future environmental laws in this area could further increase our costs and impact our operations.
 Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal, and costs associated with the leakage or discharge of hazardous materials we transport for our customers, among others. Although we have programs in place designed to monitor and control environmental risks and to promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, violations of applicable environmental laws or regulations or spills or other accidents involving hazardous substances can still occur and may subject us to cleanup costs, liabilities not covered by insurance, substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. 
 Food and Drug Administration.
 As a transportation provider of foodstuffs, we are subject to rules and regulations issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide for the security of food and foodstuffs throughout the supply chain. The FDA has issued a final rule to establish certain requirements under the Sanitary Food and Transportation Act (SFTA) for vehicles and transportation equipment, transportation operations, training, recordkeeping and waivers. The rule is designed to promote the continuance of best practices in the industry concerning cleaning, inspection, maintenance, loading and unloading of, and operation of vehicles. Under the SFTA requirements, carriers are required to develop and implement written procedures subject to recordkeeping that specify its practices for cleaning, sanitizing, and inspecting vehicles and transportation equipment. Continued compliance with current and future SFTA requirements may cause us to incur additional expenses and affect our operations.
Trademarks and Patents
 We have registered several service marks and trademarks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including Saia Guaranteed Select®, Saia Customer Service Indicators® and Saia Xtreme Guarantee®. We believe these service marks and trademarks are important components of our marketing strategy.
