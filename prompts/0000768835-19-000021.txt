Item 1. Business
The Company
Big Lots, Inc., an Ohio corporation, through its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as “we,” “us,” and “our” except as used in the reports of our independent registered public accounting firm included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”)), is a discount retailer operating in the United States (“U.S.”) (see the discussion below under the caption “Merchandise”). At February 2, 2019, we operated a total of 1,401 stores. Our goal is to exceed the expectations of our core customer (whom we refer to as Jennifer) by providing her with great savings on value-priced merchandise, which includes tasteful and “trend-right” import merchandise, consistent and replenishable “never out” offerings, and brand-name closeouts. We are dedicated to providing Jennifer with friendly service, trustworthy value, and affordable solutions in every season and category.
Similar to many other retailers, our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which results in some fiscal years being comprised of 52 weeks and some fiscal years being comprised of 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this Form 10-K relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years. The following table provides a summary of our fiscal year calendar and the associated number of weeks in each fiscal year:

Fiscal Year | Number of Weeks | Year Begin Date | Year End Date 
2019 | 52 | February 3, 2019 | February 1, 2020
2018 | 52 | February 4, 2018 | February 2, 2019
2017 | 53 | January 29, 2017 | February 3, 2018
2016 | 52 | January 31, 2016 | January 28, 2017
2015 | 52 | February 1, 2015 | January 30, 2016
2014 | 52 | February 2, 2014 | January 31, 2015

We manage our business on the basis of one segment: discount retailing. We evaluate and report overall sales and merchandise performance based on the following key merchandising categories: Furniture, Seasonal, Soft Home, Food, Consumables, Hard Home, and Electronics, Toys, & Accessories. The Furniture category includes our upholstery, mattress, case goods, and ready-to-assemble departments. The Seasonal category includes our Christmas trim, lawn & garden, summer, and other holiday departments. The Soft Home category includes our fashion bedding, utility bedding, bath, window, decorative textile, home organization, area rugs, home décor, and frames departments. The Food category includes our beverage & grocery, candy & snacks, and specialty foods departments. The Consumables category includes our health, beauty and cosmetics, plastics, paper, chemical, and pet departments. The Hard Home category includes our small appliances, table top, food preparation, stationery, greeting cards, and home maintenance departments. The Electronics, Toys, & Accessories category includes our electronics, toys, jewelry, and hosiery departments. 
In May 2001, Big Lots, Inc. was incorporated in Ohio and was the surviving entity in a merger with Consolidated Stores Corporation. By virtue of the merger, Big Lots, Inc. succeeded to all the businesses, properties, assets, and liabilities of Consolidated Stores Corporation.
Our principal executive offices are located at 4900 E. Dublin-Granville Road, Columbus, Ohio 43081, and our telephone number is (614) 278‑6800.

Merchandise
We focus our merchandise strategy on providing outstanding value to Jennifer in all of our merchandise categories. We utilize traditional sourcing methods and in certain merchandise categories also take advantage of closeout channels to enhance our ability to offer outstanding value. We evaluate our product offerings using a rating process that measures the quality, brand, fashion, and value of each item. This process requires us to focus our product offering decisions based on our customers’ expectations and enables us to compare the potential performance of traditionally-sourced merchandise, either domestic or import, to closeout merchandise, which is generally sourced from production overruns, packaging changes, discontinued products, order cancellations, liquidations, returns, and other disruptions in the supply chain of manufacturers. We believe that focusing on our customers’ expectations has improved our ability to provide a desirable assortment of offerings in our merchandise categories. 
Real Estate
The following table compares the number of our stores in operation at the beginning and end of each of the last five fiscal years: 

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
Stores open at the beginning of the year | 1,416 | | | 1,432 | | 1,449 | | | 1,460 | | 1,493 | 
Stores opened during the year | 32 | | | 24 | | 9 | | | 9 | | 24 |

Stores open at the end of the year | 1,401 | | | 1,416 | | 1,432 | | | 1,449 | | 1,460 | 

For additional information about our real estate strategy, see the discussion under the caption “Operating Strategy - Real Estate” in the accompanying “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) in this Form 10-K.
The following table details our U.S. stores by state at February 2, 2019:

Alabama | 29 | Maine | 6 | | | Ohio | 95 
Arizona | 34 | Maryland | 25 | | | Oklahoma | 18 
Arkansas | 11 | Massachusetts | 22 | | | Oregon | 15

Colorado | 18 | Minnesota | 3 | | | Rhode Island | 1 
Connecticut | 14 | Mississippi | 14 | | | South Carolina | 34 
Delaware | 5 | Missouri | 24 | | | Tennessee | 47 
Florida | 104 | Montana | 3 | | | Texas | 111
Georgia | 51 | Nebraska | 3 | | | Utah | 8 
Idaho | 6 | Nevada | 13 | | | Vermont | 4 
Illinois | 33 | New Hampshire | 6 | | | Virginia | 38 
Indiana | 45 | New Jersey | 27 | | | Washington | 26

Louisiana | 21 | North Dakota | 1 | | | | 
 | | | | Total stores | 1,401 | 
 | | | | Number of states | 47 | 

Of our 1,401 stores, 33% operate in four states: California, Texas, Florida, and Ohio, and net sales from stores in these states represented 34% of our 2018 net sales. We have a concentration in these states based on their size, population, and customer base.

Associates
At February 2, 2019, we had approximately 35,600 active associates comprised of 10,900 full-time and 24,700 part‑time associates. Approximately 69% of the associates we employed during 2018 were employed on a part-time basis. Temporary associates hired for the holiday selling season increased the total number of associates to a peak of approximately 38,400 in 2018. We consider our relationship with our associates to be good, and we are not a party to any labor agreements. 
Competition
We operate in the highly competitive retail industry. We face strong sales competition from other general merchandise, discount, food, furniture, arts and crafts, and dollar store retailers, which operate in traditional brick and mortar stores and/or online. Additionally, we compete with a number of companies for retail site locations, to attract and retain quality employees, and to acquire our broad merchandising assortment from vendors. We operate an e-commerce platform which faces additional challenges, including fulfillment logistics and technological innovation, from a wider range of retailers in a highly competitive market. 
Purchasing
The goal of our merchandising strategy is to consistently provide outstanding value to our customers in all of our merchandise categories. We believe that we have achieved this goal by reducing our reliance on sourcing merchandise through closeout offerings and expanding our planned purchases in most merchandise categories. In particular, over the past few years, we have expanded our planned purchases in our Food, Consumables, Soft Home, and Furniture merchandise categories to provide a merchandise assortment that our customers expect us to consistently offer in our stores at a significant value. In connection with the implementation of our merchandising strategy, we have expanded the role of our global sourcing department, and assessed our overseas vendor relationships. We expect our import partners to responsibly source goods that our merchandising teams identify as having our desired mix of quality, fashion, and value. During 2018, we purchased approximately 25% of our merchandise directly from overseas vendors, including approximately 21% from vendors located in China. Additionally, a significant amount of our domestically-purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad. As a result, a significant portion of our merchandise supply is subject to certain risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.
Although less prevalent in certain merchandise categories, the sourcing and purchasing of quality closeout merchandise directly from manufacturers and other vendors, typically at prices lower than those paid by traditional discount retailers, continues to represent an important competitive advantage for our Food and Consumables categories. We believe that our strong vendor relationships and our strong credit profile support this sourcing model. We expect that the unpredictability of the retail and manufacturing environments coupled with what we believe is our significant purchasing power position will continue to support our ability to source quality closeout merchandise at competitive prices in these categories. 
Warehouse and Distribution
The majority of our merchandise offerings are processed for retail sale and distributed to our stores from our five regional distribution centers located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Alabama, Oklahoma, and California. We selected the locations of our distribution centers to help manage transportation costs and the distance from distribution centers to our stores. While certain of our merchandise vendors deliver directly to our stores, the large majority of our inventory is staged and delivered from our distribution centers to facilitate prompt and efficient distribution and transportation of merchandise to our stores and help maximize our sales and inventory turnover. During 2015, we announced our intention to open a new distribution center in California and relocate our existing California distribution operations to this facility. Construction began on the new facility in 2017 and we expect the transition to begin in the summer of 2019. 
In addition to our regional distribution centers that handle store merchandise, we operate two warehouses within our Ohio distribution center. One warehouse distributes fixtures and supplies to our stores and our five regional distribution centers and the other warehouse supplements our fulfillment center for our e-commerce operations. 
For additional information regarding our warehouses and distribution facilities and related initiatives, see the discussion under the caption “Warehouse and Distribution” in “Item 2. Properties” of this Form 10-K.

Advertising and Promotion
Our brand image is an important part of our marketing program. Our principal trademarks, including the Big Lots® family of trademarks, have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We use a variety of marketing vehicles to promote our brand awareness, including television, internet, social media, e-mail, in-store point-of-purchase, and print media. 
Over the past few years, we have refined our brand identity to accentuate our friendly service and community orientation. We are focused on serving Jennifer with a friendly approach and positive shopping experience. Another aspect of community-oriented approach to retailing is our focus on supporting both local and national causes that aid the communities in which we do business. On a local level, we invest and support our associates throughout our geographic regions with our point of sale campaigns, and the positive impacts those campaigns generate for our foundation partners. We serve the community on a national level through our Big Lots Foundation which focuses on healthcare, housing, hunger, and education. We believe our approach to retailing differentiates us from the competition and allows us to make a difference in the communities we serve. 
In all of our markets, we design and distribute printed advertising circulars, through a combination of newspaper insertions and mailings. In 2018, we distributed multi-page circulars representing 28 weeks of advertising coverage, which was consistent with 2017. We create regional versions of these circulars to tailor our advertising message to market differences caused by product availability, climate, and customer preferences. Our customer database is an important marketing tool that allows us to communicate in a cost-effective manner with our customers, including e-mail delivery of our circulars. In 2017, we rolled-out our new rewards program, BIG Rewards, which replaced our former Buzz Club Rewards® program. The BIG Rewards program rewards our customers for making frequent and high-ticket purchases and offers a special birthday surprise to our BIG Rewards members. At February 2, 2019, our BIG Rewards program totaled over 17 million active members who had made a purchase in our stores in the last 12 months.
Another element of our marketing approach focuses on brand management by communicating our message directly to Jennifer through social and digital media outlets, including Facebook®, Instagram®, Twitter®, Pinterest®, and YouTube®. Our marketing program also employs a traditional television campaign, which combines strategic branding and promotional elements used in most of our other marketing media. Our highly-targeted media placement strategy uses strategically selected networks and programs aired by national cable providers as the foundation of our television advertising. In addition, we use in-store promotional materials, including in-store signage, to emphasize special bargains and significant values offered to our customers. Total advertising expense as a percentage of total net sales was 1.8%, 1.7%, and 1.8% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Seasonality
We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability, with a larger percentage of our net sales and operating profit realized in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the Christmas holiday selling season. In addition, our quarterly net sales and operating profits can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings, advertising, and certain holidays. We historically receive a higher proportion of merchandise, carry higher inventory levels, and incur higher outbound shipping and payroll expenses as a percentage of sales in our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during our fourth fiscal quarter. Performance during our fourth fiscal quarter typically reflects a leveraging effect which has a favorable impact on our operating results because net sales are higher and certain of our costs, such as rent and depreciation, are fixed and do not vary as sales levels escalate. If our sales performance is significantly better or worse during the Christmas holiday selling season, we would expect a more pronounced impact on our annual financial results than if our sales performance is significantly better or worse in a different season.
