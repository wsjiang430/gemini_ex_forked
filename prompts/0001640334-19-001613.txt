ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 29, 2016. We are engaged in the business of content writing and editing services.

On October 26 2017, our Board of Directors approved a forward stock split of our issued and authorized shares of common stock on the basis of 20 new shares for one (1) old share, increasing of our authorized capital from 75,000,000 shares of common stock to 1,500,000,000 shares of common stock. Correspondingly, our issued and outstanding capital increased from 5,590,000 shares of common stock to 111,800,000 shares of common stock. The $0.001 par value of our common shares remained unchanged. The forward stock split was payable upon surrender and no fractional shares were issued. Fractional shares were rounded up.

Also on October 26, 2017, our board of directors approved an agreement and plan of merger for the purposes of changing our corporate name from Koldeck Inc. to Global House Holdings Ltd. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, our company merged with our wholly-owned subsidiary Global House Holdings Ltd., a Nevada corporation. Koldeck Inc. remained the surviving company of the merger, continuing under the name Global House Holdings Ltd.

The resolutions of our Board of Directors approving the above described forward stock split and name change were subject to the prior approval of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). On January 31, 2018, in anticipation of FINRA approval, we filed a Certificate of Change and Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State to give effect to the forward stock split and name change. The name change and forward stock split were subsequently approved by FINRA on March 29, 2018 with a market effective date of April 3, 2018. As a result, effective April 3, 2018, we adopted the new trading symbol GHHHD. After 20 business days, the symbol changed to GHHH. Our new CUSIP number is 37891G108.

Our business and corporate address is No. 9, Alley 27, Section 4, Renai Road, Daan District, Tapei, Taiwan and our telephone number is +852 5238 9111. We do not have a corporate website.

We do not have any subsidiaries.

We have never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding.

Our Current Business

Our main business activity is content writing and editing services. We plan to deliver our services to both individuals and companies, as well as to printed or digital newspapers and magazines. Our main objective is to provide our customers with a quality service of text composing and editing of written materials. As additional services we may offer help with illustrating and designing book covers, as we plan to hire professional designers if business turns out profitable. We plan to write the texts based on data provided by our customers by mail, by phone or directly in person during the interviews. We also plan to deliver services on writing creative texts such as pieces of fiction, poetry, blog posts, and articles for magazines or newspapers. We also plan to deliver texts not related to fiction such as business proposals, presentations, bids, customer offers and letters. We also plan to offer editing and rewriting services. We also plan to carry out the jobs of editing or rewriting texts to make them more appealing to the final reader, as well as to make them look professionally-written. As business grows, we may change our services to the needs of the markets or to the needs of the company or to meet the requirements of our customers.

Principal Products or Services and their Markets

We plan to deliver single pieces of texts or consecutive series of them, as well as texts in large volumes such as books. We hope it may turn economically beneficial for the newspapers or magazines from where we expect to get multiple orders. At the initial stages we may promote our services by writing guest posts on different web blogs or blogs of Internet magazines. We might expect more orders from them and start delivering articles. We also plan to sell services by packages.

Packages may include: composing texts, searching data to compose the text, proofreading and editing of the ready texts. The price for the package will be determined by the average market price for the similar services adding the price of editing, proofreading or amount of data per article to search. To meet the maximum of our customers’ needs we expect the prices of every package to be negotiable and based on the specification of a certain project. For additional fees we also intend to provide services on promoting our customers’ books on Amazon, iBooks and similar services.

We expect to receive orders online from our future website as our customers may reside in any remote location. As such, we intend to target the broad international public. We plan to use chatbots on the website to collect the orders from clients for our managers. If data in the order is insufficient the customers may be contacted via email or directly by phone. Managers sort out the orders and hand them to the writers. We can expect to hire freelancers to work for us at a certain stage of development or whenever there is a need for additional workforce. We can expect those freelancers to interview our customers in order to write the texts corresponding to the customer’s needs.

Our principal services may be split into the following groups:

Creative writing - assistance in writing complete books, manuscripts, biographies, stage plays or screenplays, plots, or outlines for the works mentioned;

Business writing - assistance in writing bids, proposals, letters, presentations, research papers;

Editing - editing and formatting services, completing or rewriting the texts of non-professional writers;

Publishing - finding a publisher, designing a book cover or illustrations.

Once the customer chooses their package they agree upon the schedule of receiving and reviewing the work in progress.

There are many content writing and editing service companies in the market. It is a very competitive market.

We expect to compete as a freelance content writing and editing services company in the Creative Writing, Business Writing, Editing, and Publishing markets.

Businesses have to stay ahead of their competitors by advertising and marketing their products. They have to come up with novel ad campaigns and catchy marketing slogans. This requires innovation and an ability to produce great marketing collateral time and again to attract consumers and remain competitive in the market.

Our goal is to efficiently market products/services and thereby increase our business and value.
