Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc., headquartered in Cranford, New Jersey, is a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of critical care products targeting important medical needs with a focus on anti-infective products in adjunct cancer care and unique prescription products. Our goal is to achieve leading market positions by providing therapeutic products that address unmet medical needs yet have a lower development risk than usually is associated with new chemical entities. New formulations of previously approved drugs with substantial existing safety and efficacy data are a core focus. We seek to reduce development and clinical risks associated with drug development, yet still focus on innovative applications. Our strategy centers on products that have intellectual property and regulatory exclusivity protection, while providing competitive advantages over other existing therapeutic approaches.
 
The Company was founded as Citius Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company, on January 23, 2007. On September 12, 2014, Citius Pharmaceuticals, LLC entered into a Share Exchange and Reorganization Agreement, with Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Trail One, Inc.), a publicly traded company incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. Citius Pharmaceuticals, LLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Citius”). On March 30, 2016, Citius acquired Leonard-Meron Biosciences, Inc. (“LMB”) as a wholly-owned subsidiary. LMB was a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of critical care products with a concentration on anti-infectives.
 
Since its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, acquiring our proprietary technology, research and development, recruiting management and technical staff, and raising capital. We are developing three proprietary products: Mino-Lok, an antibiotic lock solution used to treat patients with catheter-related bloodstream infections by salvaging the infected catheter; Mino-Wrap, a liquifying gel-based wrap for reduction tissue expander infections following breast reconstructive surgeries; and Halo-Lido, a corticosteroid-lidocaine topical formulation that is intended to provide anti-inflammatory and anesthetic relief to persons suffering from hemorrhoids. We believe these unique markets for our products are large, growing, and underserved by the current prescription products or procedures.
 
Citius is subject to a number of risks common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, risks related to the development by Citius or its competitors of research and development stage products, market acceptance of its products, competition from larger companies, dependence on key personnel, dependence on key suppliers and strategic partners, the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing and the Company’s compliance with governmental and other regulations.
 
Mino-Lok®
 
Overview
 
Mino-Lok is a patented solution containing minocycline, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edetate), and ethyl alcohol, all of which act synergistically to treat and salvage infected central venous catheters (“CVCs”) in patients with catheter related bloodstream infections (“CRBSIs”). Mino-Lok breaks down biofilm barriers formed by bacterial colonies, eradicates the bacteria, and provides anti-clotting properties to maintain patency in CVCs.
 
The administration of Mino-Lok consists of filling the lumen of the catheter with 0.8 ml to 2.0 ml of Mino-Lok solution. The catheter is then “locked”, meaning that the solution remains in the catheter without flowing into the vein. The lock is maintained for a dwell-time of two hours while the catheter is not in use. If the catheter has multiple lumens, all lumens may be locked with the Mino-Lok solution either simultaneously or sequentially. If patients are receiving continuous infusion therapy, the catheters alternate between being locked with the Mino-Lok solution and delivering therapy. The Mino-Lok therapy is two hours per day for at least five days, usually with two additional locks in the subsequent two weeks. After locking the catheter for two hours, the Mino-Lok solution is aspirated, and the catheter is flushed with normal saline. At that time, either the infusion will be continued, or will be locked with the standard-of-care lock solution until further use of the catheter is required. In a clinical study conducted by MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MDACC”), there were no serum levels of either minocycline or edetate detected in the sera of several patients who underwent daily catheter lock solution with minocycline and edetate (“M-EDTA”) at the concentration level proposed in Mino-Lok treatment. Thus, it has been demonstrated that the amount of either minocycline or edetate that leaks into the serum is very low or none at all.

Phase 2b Results
 
From April 2013 to July 2014, 30 patients with CVC-related bloodstream infection were enrolled at MDACC in a prospective Phase 2b study. Patients received Mino-Lok therapy for two hours once daily for a minimum of five days within the first week, followed by two additional locks within the next two weeks. Patients were followed for one month post-lock therapy. Demographic information, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, therapy, as well as adverse events and outcome were collected for each patient. Median age at diagnosis was 56 years (range: 21-73 years). In all patients, prior to the use of lock therapy, systemic treatment with a culture-directed, first-line intravenous antibiotic was started. Microbiological eradication was achieved at the end of therapy in all cases. None of the patients experienced any serious adverse event related to the lock therapy.
 
The active arm, which is the Mino-Lok treated group of patients, was then compared to 60 patients in a matched cohort that experienced removal and replacement of their CVCs within the same contemporaneous timeframe. The patients were matched for cancer type, infecting organism, and level of neutropenia. All patients were cancer patients and treated at the MDACC. The efficacy of Mino-Lok therapy was 100% in salvaging CVCs, demonstrating equal effectiveness to removing the infected CVC and replacing with a new catheter.
 
The main purpose of the study was to show that Mino-Lok therapy was at least as effective as the removal and replacement of CVCs when CRBSIs are present, and that the safety was better, that is, the complications of removing an infected catheter and replacing with a new one could be avoided. In addition to having a 100% efficacy rate with all CVCs being salvaged, Mino-Lok therapy had no significant adverse events (“SAEs”), compared to an 18% SAE rate in the matched cohort where patients had the infected CVCs removed and replaced with a fresh catheter. There were no overall complication rates in the Mino-Lok arm group compared to 11 patients with events (18%) in the control group. These events included bacterial relapse (5%) at four weeks post-intervention, and a number of complications associated with mechanical manipulation in the removal or replacement procedure for the catheter (10%) or development of deep seated infections such as septic thrombophlebitis and osteomyelitis (8%). As footnoted, six patients had more than one complication in the control arm group.

Phase 3 Initiation
 
In November 2016, the Company initiated site recruitment for Phase 3 clinical trials. From initiation through first quarter 2017, the Company received input from several sites related to the control arm as being less than standard-of-care for some of the respective institutions. The Company worked closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) with respect to the design of the Phase 3 trial, and received feedback on August 17, 2017. The FDA stated that they recognized that there is an unmet medical need in salvaging infected catheters and agreed that an open label, superiority design would address the Company’s concerns and would be acceptable to meet the requirements of a new drug application. The Company amended the Phase 3 study design to remove the saline and heparin placebo control arm and to use an active control arm that conforms with today’s current standard-of-care. Patient enrollment commenced in February 2018.
 
The Mino-Lok Phase 3 Trial was originally planned to enroll 700 patients in 50 participating institutions, all located in the U.S. There will be interim analyses at both the 50% and 75% points of the trial as measured by the number of patients treated. As of November 30, 2019, there are 30 active sites currently enrolling patients including such academic centers as MDACC, Henry Ford Health Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, University of Chicago, and others. There are five additional well renowned medical centers in startup mode. There are no other remaining sites in feasibility.
 
In September 2019, the Company announced that the FDA agreed to a new primary efficacy endpoint of “time to catheter failure” in comparing Mino-Lok to the antibiotic lock control arm. This change in the trial design reduced the required patient sample size of the trial from 700 subjects to approximately 144 available subjects to achieve the pre-specified 92 catheter failure events needed to conclude the trial. Additionally, the Company submitted a response to the FDA that it will implement this change in the primary endpoint and expected it to result in less than 150 subjects needed in its Phase 3 trial, which the FDA is reviewing.
 
In October 2019, the FDA agreed that the patient sample size of approximately 144 patients was acceptable.
 
In October 2019, the Company announced that the Phase 3 trial had reached the 40% completion triggering an interim futility analysis.
 
Fast Track Designation
 
In October 2017, the Company received official notice from FDA that the investigational program for Mino-Lok was granted “Fast Track” status. Fast Track is a designation that expedites FDA review to facilitate development of drugs which treat a serious or life-threatening condition and fill an unmet medical need. A drug that receives Fast Track designation is eligible for the following:

● | More frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the drug’s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | More frequent written correspondence from FDA about the design of the clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Priority review to shorten the FDA review process for a new drug from ten months to six months; and,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rolling review, which means Citius can submit completed sections of its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for review by FDA, rather than waiting until every section of the application is completed before the entire application can be reviewed.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mino-Lok International Study
 
In October 2017, data from an international study on Mino-Lok was presented at the Infectious Disease Conference, (“ID Week”), in San Diego, California. The 44 patient study was conducted in Brazil, Lebanon, and Japan and showed Mino-Lok therapy was an effective intervention to salvage long-term, infected CVCs in CRBSIs in patients who had cancer with limited vascular access. This study showed 95% effectiveness for Mino-Lok therapy in achieving microbiological eradication of the CVCs as compared to 83% for the control. The single failure in the Mino-Lok arm was due to a patient with Burkholderia cepacia that was resistant to all antibiotics tested.

Stability Patent Application for Mino-Lok 
 
In October 2018, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued U.S. Patent No. 10,086,114, entitled “Antimicrobial Solutions with Enhanced Stability.” The new invention overcomes limitations in mixing antimicrobial solutions in which components have precipitated because of physical and/or chemical factors, thus limiting the stability of the post-mix solutions. The scientists and technologists at MDACC have been able to improve the stability of the post-mixed solutions through adjustments of the post-mixed pH of the solution. This may allow for longer storage time of the ready-to-use solution. Citius holds the exclusive worldwide license which provides access to this patented technology for development and commercialization of Mino-Lok.
 
On October 9, 2019, the European Patent Office (“EPO”) granted European Patent No. 3370794, entitled “Antimicrobial Solutions with Enhanced Stability.” The grant of this European patent strengthens the intellectual property protection for Mino-Lok through November of 2036. The new invention overcomes limitations in mixing antimicrobial solutions, in which components have precipitated because of physical and/or chemical factors, thus limiting the stability of the post-mix solutions. The scientists and technologists at MDACC have been able to improve the stability of the post-mixed solutions through adjustments of the post-mixed pH of the solution. This may allow for longer storage time of the ready-to-use solution.
 
Market Opportunity
 
In spite of best clinical practice, catheters contribute to approximately 70% of blood stream infections that occur in the intensive care unit, or are associated with hemodialysis or cancer patients (approximately 470,000 per year). Bacteria enter the catheter either from the skin or intraluminally through the catheter hub. Once in the catheter, bacteria tend to form a protective biofilm on the interior surface of the catheter that is resistant to most antimicrobial solutions. The most frequently used maintenance flush, heparin, actually stimulates biofilm formation. Heparin is widely used as a prophylactic lock solution, in spite of the evidence that it contributes to the promotion of biofilm formation. The formation of bacterial biofilm usually precedes CRBSIs.
 
The standard-of-care (“SOC”) in the management of CRBSI patients consists of removing the infected CVC and replacing it with a new catheter at a different vascular access site. However, in cancer and hemodialysis patients with long-term surgically implantable silicone catheters, removal of the CVC and reinsertion of a new one at a different site might be difficult, or even impossible, because of the unavailability of other accessible vascular sites and the need to maintain infusion therapy. Furthermore, critically ill patients with short-term catheters often have underlying coagulopathy, which makes reinsertion of a new CVC at a different site, in the setting of CRBSIs, risky in terms of mechanical complications, such as pneumothorax, misplacement, or arterial puncture. Studies have also revealed that CRBSI patients may be associated with serious complications, including septic thrombosis, endocarditis and disseminated infection, particularly if caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Candida species. Furthermore, catheter retention in patients with CRBSIs is associated with a higher risk of relapse and poor response to antimicrobial therapy.
 
According to Maki et al., published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings in 2006, there are approximately 250,000 CRBSIs annually in the U.S. Subsequent to this study, our estimates have ranged upwards to over 450,000 central line associated blood stream infections (“CLABSIs”) annually (see analysis in the table below). CRBSIs are associated with a 12% to 35% mortality rate and an attributable cost of $35,000 to $56,000 per episode.
 
We estimate that the potential market for Mino-Lok in the U.S. to be approximately $500 million to $1 billion as shown in the table below based on a target price of up to $300 per dose of each salvage flush treatment.

Under various plausible pricing scenarios, we believe that Mino-Lok would be cost saving to the healthcare system given that the removal of an infected CVC and replacement of a new catheter in a different venous access site is estimated by us to cost between $8,000 and $10,000. Furthermore, there are potential additional medical benefits, a reduction in patient discomfort and avoidance of serious adverse events with the Mino-Lok approach since the catheter remains in place and is not subject to manipulation. We believe there will be an economic argument to enhance the adoption of Mino-Lok by infection control committees at acute care institutions.
 
In January of 2017, the Company commissioned a primary market research study with MEDACore, a subsidiary of Leerink, a healthcare focused network with more than 35,000 healthcare professionals, including key opinion leaders, experienced practitioners and other healthcare professionals throughout North America, Europe, Asia and other locations around the world. This network includes approximately 55 clinical specialties, 21 basic sciences and 20 business specialties. As part of this market research project, the Company commissioned a third party survey of 31 physicians to qualify the need for catheter salvage in patients with infected, indwelling central venous lines, especially when the catheter is a tunneled or an implanted port. There were 19 infectious disease experts and 12 intensivists surveyed who all agreed that salvage would be preferable to catheter exchange to avoid catheter misplacements, blood clots, or vessel punctures that can potentially occur during reinsertion. Most were also concerned that viable venous access may not be available in patients who were vitally dependent on a central line.
 
Mino-Wrap
 
Overview
 
On January 2, 2019, we entered into a patent and technology license agreement with the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System on behalf of the MDACC, whereby we in-licensed exclusive worldwide rights to the patented technology for any and all uses relating to breast implants, specifically the Mino-Wrap technology. This includes rights to U.S. Patent No. 9,849,217, which was issued on December 16, 2017. We intend to develop Mino-Wrap as a liquefying, gel-based wrap containing minocycline and rifampin for the reduction of infections associated with breast implants following breast reconstructive surgeries.  We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize Mino-Wrap under several regulatory scenarios and achieve milestones associated with these regulatory options leading to an approval from the FDA. Mino-Wrap will require pre-clinical development prior to any regulatory pathway. In July 2019, we announced that we intend to pursue the FDA’s Investigational New Drug (“IND”) regulatory pathway for the development of Mino-Wrap.
Market Opportunity
 
Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women worldwide representing 25% of all cancer diagnoses with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer. In the United States, the overall rate of mastectomies, combining single and double mastectomies, has increased 36% from 2005 to 2013. Additionally, the incidence of post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, following breast cancer treatment, has been increasing on an annual basis.
 
5

 

In 2017, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons reported that over 105,000 women in the United States underwent a post-mastectomy breast reconstructive procedure. Approximately 30% of the breast reconstruction occurs simultaneously with mastectomy, with most reconstructions occurring weeks later.
 
The current standard of care in post-mastectomy breast reconstructive is the use of a Tissue Expander (“TE”), which is a temporary implant that is placed below the pectoralis muscle within the mastectomy space. Once a sufficiently large soft tissue envelope has been created, the TE is then replaced by a permanent breast implant. Approximately 80% of the time, a TE is used in breast reconstructions.
 
The rate of infection following a mastectomy with a TE is 2.4 to 24% with an estimated mean of 12-14%. Once the implant becomes infected, the patient is usually hospitalized requiring approximate 2 weeks of IV and/or oral antimicrobials. In addition, the TE is removed, leading to a delay of lifesaving chemo-radiation therapy, and a more complex reconstruction in the future.
 
Currently, preventive measures are used to decrease the rate of TE infections with include a systemic perioperative antimicrobial agent with the perioperative immersion of the implant or irrigation of the surgical pocket with an antimicrobial solution prior to insertion of the device. This is also administered with immediate postoperative oral antimicrobials.
 
Based on the in vitro preclinical laboratory work, Mino-Wrap appears to have the characteristics necessary for advancement in the protection of human implants from subsequent infection.
 
Halo-Lido
 
Overview
 
Halo-Lido is a topical formulation of halobetasol propionate, a corticosteroid and lidocaine that is intended for the treatment of hemorrhoids. To our knowledge, there are currently no FDA-approved prescription drug products for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Some physicians are known to prescribe topical steroids for the treatment of hemorrhoids. In addition, there are various topical combination prescription products containing halobetasol propionate along with lidocaine or pramoxine, each a topical anesthetic, that are prescribed by physicians for the treatment of hemorrhoids. These products contain drugs that were in use prior to the start of the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (“DESI”) program and are commonly referred to as DESI drugs. However, none of these single-agent or combination prescription products have been clinically evaluated for safety and efficacy and approved by the FDA for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Further, many hemorrhoid patients use over the counter (“OTC”) products as their first line therapy. OTC products contain any one of several active ingredients including glycerin, phenylephrine, pramoxine, white petrolatum, shark liver oil and/or witch hazel, for symptomatic relief.
Development of Hemorrhoids Drugs
 
Hemorrhoids are a common gastrointestinal disorder, characterized by anal itching, pain, swelling, tenderness, bleeding and difficulty defecating. In the U.S., hemorrhoids affect nearly 5% of the population, with approximately 10 million persons annually admitting to having symptoms of hemorrhoidal disease. Of these persons, approximately one third visit a physician for evaluation and treatment of their hemorrhoids. The data also indicate that for both sexes a peak of prevalence occurs from age 45 to 65 years with a subsequent decrease after age 65 years. Caucasian populations are affected significantly more frequently than African Americans, and increased prevalence rates are associated with higher socioeconomic status in men but not women. Development of hemorrhoids before age 20 is unusual. In addition, between 50% and 90% of the general U.S., Canadian and European population will experience hemorrhoidal disease at least once in life. Although hemorrhoids and other anorectal diseases are not life-threatening, individual patients can suffer from agonizing symptoms which can limit social activities and have a negative impact on the quality of life.
 
Hemorrhoids are defined as internal or external according to their position relative to the dentate line. Classification is important for selecting the optimal treatment for an individual patient. Accordingly, physicians use the following grading system referred to as the Goligher’s classification of internal hemorrhoids:
 

Grade I | Hemorrhoids not prolapsed but bleeding. 
----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grade II | Hemorrhoids prolapse and reduce spontaneously with or without bleeding. 
Grade III | Prolapsed hemorrhoids that require reduction manually. 
Grade IV | Prolapsed and cannot be reduced including both internal and external hemorrhoids that are confluent from skin tag to inner anal canal.

Development Activities to Date
 
In the fall of 2015, we completed dosing patients in a double-blind dose ranging placebo controlled Phase 2a study where six different formulations containing hydrocortisone and lidocaine in various strengths were tested against the vehicle control. The objectives of this study were to: (1) demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the formulations when applied twice daily for two weeks in subjects with Grade I or II hemorrhoids, and (2) assess the potential contribution of lidocaine hydrochloride and hydrocortisone acetate, alone or in combination for the treatment of symptoms of Goligher’s Classification Grade I or II hemorrhoids.
 
Symptom improvement was observed based on a global score of disease severity (“GSDS”), and based on some of the individual signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids, specifically itching and overall pain and discomfort. Within the first few days of treatment, the combination products (containing both hydrocortisone and lidocaine) were directionally favorable versus the placebo and their respective individual active treatment groups (e.g., hydrocortisone or lidocaine alone) in achieving ‘almost symptom free’ or ’symptom free’ status according to the GSDS scale. These differences suggest the possibility of a benefit for the combination product formulation.
 
Overall, results from adverse event reporting support the safety profile of all test articles evaluated in this study and demonstrate similar safety profiles as compared to the vehicle. The safety findings were unremarkable. There was a low occurrence of adverse events and a similar rate of treatment related adverse events across all treatment groups. The majority of adverse events were mild and only one was severe. None of the adverse events were an SAE and the majority of adverse events were recovered/resolved at the end of the study. There were only two subjects who were discontinued from the study due to adverse events.
 
In addition to the safety and dose-ranging information, information was obtained relating to the use of the GSDS as an assessment tool for measuring the effectiveness of the test articles. Individual signs and symptoms were also assessed but can vary from patient to patient. Therefore, the goal of the GSDS was to provide an assessment tool that could be used for all patients regardless of which signs and symptoms they are experiencing. The GSDS proved to be a more effective tool for assessing the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of the drug when compared to the assessment of the individual signs and symptoms. Citius believes that we can continue to develop this assessment tool as well as other patient reported outcome endpoints for use in the next trials and in the pivotal trial.
 
Information was also obtained about the formulation of the drug and the vehicle. As a result of this study, we believe that the performance of the active arms of the study relative to the vehicle can be improved by re-formulating our topical preparation. Therefore, we have initiated work on vehicle formulation and evaluation of higher potency steroids.
 
In June and July 2016, we engaged the Dominion Group, a leading provider of healthcare and pharmaceutical marketing research services. The primary market research was conducted to understand the symptoms that are most bothersome to patients better in order to develop meaningful endpoints for the clinical trials. We also learned about the factors that drive patients to seek medical attention for hemorrhoids in an effort to understand the disease impact on quality of life. The results of this survey are able to help us develop patient reported outcome evaluation tools. These tools can be used in clinical trials to evaluate the patients’ conditions and to assess the performance of the test articles.
 
In March 2018, we announced that we had selected a higher potency corticosteroid in our steroid/anesthetic topical formulation program for the treatment of hemorrhoids. The original topical preparation, which we referred to as Hydro-Lido or CITI-001, which was used in the Phase 2a study, was a combination of hydrocortisone acetate and lidocaine hydrochloride. The new formulation, CITI-002, which we refer to as Halo-Lido, will combine lidocaine with the higher potency corticosteroid halobetasol propionate for symptomatic relief of the pain and discomfort of hemorrhoids.
 
7

 

We held a Type C meeting with the FDA in December 2017 to discuss the results of the Phase 2a study and to obtain the FDA’s view on development plans to support the potential formulation change for the planned Phase 2b study. We also requested the FDA’s feedback on our Phase 2b study design, including target patient population, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and efficacy endpoints. The pre-clinical and clinical development programs for CITI-002 are planned to be similar to those conducted for the development of CITI-001 to support the design for a planned Phase 3 clinical trial.
 
Market Opportunity
 
The current market for OTC and topical prescription (“Rx”) products for the symptomatic treatment of hemorrhoids is highly fragmented, and includes approximately 20 million units of OTC and over 4 million prescriptions. None of the Rx products have received FDA approval and are only available due to the DESI program, which started decades ago after enactment of the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments. These DESI products have no FDA reviewed evidence of efficacy or safety, and may be subject to withdrawal if an approved product were to be introduced. Several topical combination prescription products for the treatment of hemorrhoids are available containing hydrocortisone in strengths ranging from 0.5% to 3.0%, combined with lidocaine in strengths ranging from 1.0% to 3.0%. The various topical formulations include creams, ointments, gels, lotions, enemas, pads, and suppositories. The most commonly prescribed topical combination gel is sold as a branded generic product and contains 2.5% hydrocortisone and 3.0% lidocaine.
 
We believe there are currently no FDA-approved prescription drug products for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Although there are numerous Rx and OTC products commonly used to treat hemorrhoids, none possess proven safety and efficacy data generated from rigorously conducted clinical trials. We believe that a novel topical formulation of halobetasol propionate and lidocaine designed to provide anti-inflammatory and anesthetic relief and which has an FDA-approved label specifically claiming the treatment of hemorrhoids will become an important treatment option for physicians who want to provide their patients with a therapy that has demonstrated safety and efficacy in treating this uncomfortable and often recurring disease. We believe that our Halo-Lido product represents an attractive, low-risk product opportunity with meaningful upside potential.
 
Market Exclusivity
 
We believe that we will be the first company to conduct rigorous clinical trials and receive FDA approval of a topical corticosteroid-lidocaine combination product for the treatment of hemorrhoids. If we receive FDA approval, we will qualify for three years of market exclusivity for our dosage strength and formulation. In addition, we will also be the only product on the market specifically proven to be safe and effective for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Generally, if a company conducts clinical trials and receives FDA approval of a product for which there are similar, but non FDA-approved, prescription products on the market, the manufacturers of the unapproved but marketed products are required to withdraw them from the market. However, the FDA has significant latitude in determining how to enforce its regulatory powers in these circumstances. We have not had any communication with the FDA regarding this matter and cannot predict what action, if any, the FDA will take with respect to the unapproved products.
 
We believe that should Halo-Lido receive FDA approval and demonstrate, proven safety and efficacy data, and if Halo-Lido obtains three years of market exclusivity based on our dosage strength and formulation, we are likely to have a meaningful advantage in our pursuit of achieving a significant position in the market for topical combination prescription products for the treatment of hemorrhoids.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
We are primarily focused on identifying opportunities within the critical care and cancer care market segments. In our product acquisition criteria, we concentrate on markets that are highly influenced by key opinion leaders, commonly referred to as KOLs, and in which products are prescribed by a relatively small number of physicians, yet provide opportunities for growth and market share. This strategy allows for a manageable commercialization effort for our Company in terms of resources and capital. We also seek to provide cost-effective therapies that would be endorsed by payers, patients, and providers. We believe that we will be able to commercialize products within the scope of these criteria ourselves, and that we can create marketing synergies by having a common narrow audience for our marketing efforts (“several products in the bag for the same customer”).

For our product candidates that fall out of the narrow scope criteria, we have identified pharmaceutical companies with large sales forces, experienced sales and marketing management teams, direct-to-consumer capabilities, significantly larger resources than ours, and non-competing product portfolios that we believe would make excellent sales and marketing partners for us. We intend to license our mass audience, non-specialty product candidates to such companies for sales and marketing.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality, licensing and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates both in the U.S. and abroad. However, patent protection may not provide us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests.
Mino-Lok Intellectual Property 
 
In May 2014, our subsidiary LMB entered into a patent and technology license agreement with Novel Anti-Infective Therapeutics, Inc. (“NAT”), who licensed the intellectual property from MDACC, to develop and commercialize Mino-Lok on an exclusive, worldwide (except for South America), sub-licensable basis. LMB incurred a one-time license fee in May 2014. On March 20, 2017, LMB entered into an amendment to the license agreement that expanded the licensed territory to include South America, providing LMB with worldwide rights. We are obligated to pay annual maintenance fees that increase annually until reaching a designated amount, which we must pay until the first sale of product. We also must pay up to an aggregate of approximately $1.1 million in milestone payments, depending on the achievement of various regulatory and commercial milestones. Under the terms of the license agreement, we also must pay a royalty equal to mid-single digit percentages to low-double digit percentages of net sales, depending on the level of sales in that year, and subject to downward adjustment to lower- to mid-single digit percentages in the event there is no valid patent for the product in the country of sale at the time of sale. After the first sale of product, we will owe an annual minimum royalty payment that will increase annually until reaching a designated amount, which we must pay duration of the term. We will be responsible for all patent expenses for the term of the agreement although MDACC is responsible for filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patents.
 
Unless earlier terminated by NAT based on the failure to achieve certain development or commercial milestones, the license agreement remains in effect until the date that all patents licensed under the agreement have expired and all patent applications within the licensed patent rights have been cancelled, withdrawn or expressly abandoned. NAT may terminate the license agreement at any time after four years in any country if we have not commercialized or are not actively attempting to commercialize a product in such country. The license agreement will terminate in the event we breach any of our payment or reporting obligations or NAT breaches any of its obligations under the agreement. NAT will have the right to terminate the agreement if we bring or participate in an action to challenge NAT’s ownership of any of the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the license agreement upon 180 days’ notice. The license agreement may also be terminated upon our and NAT’s mutual consent.
 
Mino-Lok is covered in relation to the composition by issued U.S. patent No. 7,601,731, entitled “Antimicrobial Flush Solutions,” which was issued on October 13, 2009. Mino-Lok is further covered in relation to its method of use by issued U.S. Patent No. 9,078,441, which was issued on July 14, 2015. The patents provide intellectual property protection until June 7, 2024. There are corresponding patents granted in Europe and Canada (European Patent No. EP 1644024, and Canadian Patent No. 2528522).

Stability Patent Application for Mino-Lok
 
In October 2018, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued U.S. Patent No. 10,086,114 (the “114 patent”), entitled “Antimicrobial Solutions with Enhanced Stability.” On October 9, 2019, the European Patent Office (“EPO”) granted European Patent No. 3370794, which corresponds to the ‘114 patent. The grant of these patents strengthens the intellectual property protection for Mino-Lok through November 2036. While the original patents for Mino-Lok (discussed above) cover the basic composition, the new invention overcomes limitations in mixing antimicrobial solutions in which components have precipitated because of physical and/or chemical factors, thus limiting the stability of the post-mix solutions. The scientists and technologists at MDACC have been able to improve the stability of the post-mixed solutions through adjustments of the post-mixed pH of the solution. This may allow for longer storage time of the ready-to-use solution. As such, the patents claiming the enhanced stability may effectively extend patent protection for Mino-Lok beyond the 2024 expiration of the original patents since it is expected that the compositions providing enhanced stability would be preferred over any non-stabilized versions that a competitor may introduce after June 7, 2024. Citius holds the exclusive worldwide license which provides access to this patented technology for development and commercialization of Mino-Lok.
 
Mino-Lok has received a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (“QIDP”) designation. The QIDP designation provides New Drug Applications an additional five years of market exclusivity, which together with the potential three years of exclusivity for the new strength and formulation of Mino-Lok, would result in a combined total of eight years of market exclusivity regardless of patent protection.
 
Mino-Wrap Intellectual Property
 
In January 2019, we entered into a patent and technology license agreement with MDACC to develop and commercialize Mino-Wrap on an exclusive worldwide basis, with no rights to sub-license. We paid a one-time upfront licensing fee upon execution of the agreement. Under the agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize Mino-Wrap under several regulatory scenarios and achieve milestones that are associated with these regulatory options leading to an approval from the FDA. We are obligated to pay annual maintenance fees that increase annually until reaching a designated amount, which we must pay until the first sale of product. We also must pay up to an aggregate of $2.1 million in milestone payments, depending on the achievement of various regulatory and commercial milestones. Under the terms of the license agreement, we also must pay a royalty equal to mid- to upper-single digit percentages of net sales, depending on the level of sales in that year, and subject to downward adjustment to lower- to mid-single digit percentages in the event there is no valid patent for the product in the United States at the time of sale. After the first sale of product, we will owe an annual minimum royalty payment that will increase annually for the duration of the term. We will be responsible for all patent expenses incurred by MDACC for the term of the agreement although MDACC is responsible for filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patents.
 
The term of the license agreement will end on the later of the expiration of all licensed patents, or the fifteenth anniversary of the agreement. MDACC may terminate the license agreement at any time after four years in any country if we have not commercialized or are not actively attempting to commercialize a product in such country. The license agreement will terminate in the event we breach any of our payment or reporting obligations or MDACC breaches any of its obligations under the agreement. MDACC will have the right to terminate the agreement if we bring or participate in an action to challenge MDACC’s ownership of any of the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the license agreement upon 180 days’ notice. The license agreement may also be terminated upon our and MDACC’s mutual consent.
 
In December 2017, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent No. 9,849,217, entitled “Antimicrobial Wraps for Medical Implants.” The new invention overcomes limitations in breast reconstruction utilizing tissue expanders and implants following mastectomies by providing, in certain aspects, biodegradable antimicrobial film that may be wrapped around a medical implant such as a breast implant prior to the insertion into a subject such as a human patient. The scientists and technologists at MDACC have developed a biodegradable covering for a medical implant comprising a highly plasticized gelatin and at least one drug to reduce infection. Citius holds the exclusive worldwide license which provides access to this patented technology for development and commercialization of Mino-Wrap.

Halo-Lido Intellectual Property
 
We are developing Halo-Lido to have a unique combination of excipients as well as unique concentrations of the active ingredients. The goal is to have a product that is optimized for stability and activity. Once the formulation development is completed and data is obtained, we intend to apply for a patent on this new topical formulation.
 
We seek to achieve approval for Halo-Lido by utilizing the FDA’s 505(b)(2) pathway. This pathway allows an applicant to file an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from prior studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference to such prior third-party studies. This pathway would provide three years of market exclusivity.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive and regulated industry which is subject to rapid and frequent changes. We face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing drugs that would compete with the drug candidates that we are developing and the same or similar products that target the same conditions we intend to treat. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to compete successfully against these organizations, which include many large, well-financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies.
 
Mino-Lok Competition
 
Currently, the only alternative to Mino-Lok in the treatment of infected CVCs in CRBSI/CLABSI patients of which we are aware, is the SOC of removing the culprit CVC and replacing a new CVC at a different vascular site. Citius is not aware of any Investigational New Drug Applications (“INDs”) for a salvage antibiotic lock solution and does not expect any to be forthcoming due to the difficulty of meeting the necessary criteria to be effective and practical.
 
At this time, there are no pharmacologic agents approved in the U.S. for the prevention or treatment of CRBSIs or CLABSIs in central venous catheters. Citius is aware that there are several agents in development for prevention but none for salvage. The most prominent of these appear to be Neutrolin from CorMedix Inc. and B-Lock from Great Lakes Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“GLP”).
 
Neutrolin® (CorMedix Inc.) 
 
Neutrolin is a formulation of Taurolidine 1.35%, Citrate 3.5%, and Heparin 1000 units/mL. Neutrolin is an anti-microbial catheter lock solution being developed by CorMedix to prevent CRBSIs and to prevent clotting. In January 2015, the FDA granted Fast Track and Qualified Infectious Disease Product (“QIDP”) designations for Neutrolin. In December 2015, CorMedix initiated its Phase 3 clinical trial in hemodialysis patients in the United States. The clinical trial named Catheter Lock Solution Investigational Trial, or LOCK-IT-100 is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active control trial designed to show efficacy and safety of Neutrolin in preventing CRBSIs in subjects receiving hemodialysis therapy. On April 20, 2017, CorMedix provided an update on the LOCK-IT-100 trial. CorMedix had enrolled 368 patients to date and completed a safety review by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) of the first 279 patients. The DSMB concluded that it was safe to continue the trial as designed; however, CorMedix initiated discussions with the FDA to make some protocol changes to include one or more interim efficacy analyses. According to CorMedix, the FDA accepted the CorMedix proposal.
 
On June 20, 2018, CorMedix announced that it had completed its review and source-verification of the data required for the interim analysis of the Phase 3 LOCK-IT-100 study for Neutrolin. The data was then locked and transferred to the independent biostatistician for un-blinding and analysis, who then provided the results to the DSMB for its review.
 
On July 25, 2018 CorMedix announced that the DSMB had completed its review of the interim analysis of the data from the currently ongoing Phase 3 LOCK-IT-100 study for Neutrolin. Because the pre-specified level of statistical significance was reached and efficacy had been demonstrated, the DSMB recommended the study be terminated early. No safety concerns were reported by the DSMB based on the interim analysis. CorMedix is expected to submit the results of the interim analysis to the FDA for its review.

B-Lock™ (Great Lakes Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)
 
B-Lock is a triple combination of trimethoprim, EDTA and ethanol from Great Lakes Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“GLP”). On July 24, 2012, GLP announced the initiation of a clinical study of B-Lock. We are unaware as to the progress or results of these studies. In addition, we are not aware of any IND being filed in the U.S. for B-Lock, nor are we aware of any clinical studies to support salvage of infected catheters in bacteremic patients.
 
Neither of these lock solutions have been shown to be effective in salvaging catheters in bacteremic patients as Mino-Lok is intended to do, and Citius does not expect that either would be pursued for this indication.
 
There has been no further public information available on GLP. GLP’s web site and phone number are no longer active and the Company believes that they have ceased operations.
 
Mino-Wrap Competition
 
The primary competition for Mino-Wrap would be the existing standard-of-care which includes a systemic perioperative antimicrobial agent with the perioperative immersion of the implant or irrigation of the surgical pocket with an antimicrobial solution prior to insertion of the tissue expander device. This is also administered with immediate postoperative oral antimicrobials.
 
Halo-Lido Competition
 
The primary competition in the hemorrhoid market is non-prescription over the counter products. If approved by the FDA, Halo-Lido will be the only prescription product for the treatment of hemorrhoids.
 
Supply and Manufacturing
 
We do not currently have and we do not intend to set up our own manufacturing facilities. We expect to use approved contract manufacturers for manufacturing our product candidates in all stages of development after we file for FDA approval. Each of our domestic and foreign contract manufacturing establishments, including any contract manufacturers we may decide to use, must be listed in the NDA and must be registered with the FDA. Also, the FDA imposes substantial annual fees on manufacturers of branded products.
 
In general, our suppliers purchase raw materials and supplies on the open market. Substantially all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so that the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on us.
 
If we elect to conduct product development and manufacturing, we will be subject to regulation under various federal and state laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other present and potential future federal, state or local regulations.
 
We have contracted with proven suppliers and manufacturers for active pharmaceutical ingredient, development and packaging. We are confident that all materials meet or will meet specifications discussed at the chemistry, manufacturing and controls meeting with the FDA.

Regulation
 
United States Government Regulation
 
The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. All of our current product candidates are considered drugs rather than medical devices. Consequently, we intend to submit and NDA to the FDA for each of Mino-Lok, Halo-Lido and Mino-Wrap.
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the agency’s implementing regulations. If we fail to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, and the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our company and its operations.
 
Before any of our drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States, it must be approved by the FDA. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:
 

● | preclinical laboratory and animal tests, and formulation studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for human clinical testing that must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each indication for which approval is sought; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission to the FDA of an NDA and FDA’s acceptance of the NDA for filing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is to be produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Foreign Regulation
 
We and any of our collaborative partners may be subject to widely varying foreign regulations, which may be different from those of the FDA, governing clinical trials, manufacture, product registration and approval and pharmaceutical sales. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, we or our collaboration partners must obtain a separate approval for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the commencement of product marketing in such countries. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In addition, under current United States law, there are restrictions on the export of products not approved by the FDA, depending on the country involved and the status of the product in that country.
 
International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. to take advantage of differing regulatory requirements. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling those products in those countries.

In the European Union, in order for a product to be marketed and sold, it is required to comply with the Medical Devices Directive and obtain CE Mark certification. The CE Mark certification encompasses an extensive review of the applicant’s quality management system which is inspected by a notified body’s auditor as part of a stage 1 and 2 International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 13485:2016 audit, in accordance with worldwide recognized ISO standards and applicable European Medical Devices Directives for quality management systems for medical device manufacturers. Once the quality management system and design dossier has been successfully audited by a notified body and reviewed and approved by a competent authority, a CE certificate for the medical device will be issued. Applicants are also required to comply with other foreign regulations such as the requirement to obtain Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approval before a new product can be launched in Japan. The time required to obtain these foreign approvals to market our products may vary from U.S. approvals, and requirements for these approvals may differ from those required by the FDA.
 
Medical device laws and regulations are in effect in many of the countries in which we may do business outside the United States. These laws and regulations range from comprehensive device approval requirements for our medical device product to requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in such countries and may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining its foreign regulatory approvals. In addition, the export of certain of our products which have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to FDA export restrictions. Any failure to obtain product approvals in a timely fashion or to comply with state or foreign medical device laws and regulations may have a serious adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2019, we had 9 employees and various consultants providing support. Through our consulting and collaboration arrangements, and including our Scientific Advisory Board, we have access to more than 30 additional professionals, who possess significant expertise in business development, legal, accounting, regulatory affairs, clinical operations and manufacturing. We also rely upon a network of consultants to support our clinical studies and manufacturing efforts.
