Mission Statement
Our mission is to empower and protect how people work and connect by enabling any user on any device to securely access any application, use any network or cloud and perform any transaction.
Overview
We believe we are defining a new category of Zero Trust access for enterprises and governments. Our Zero Trust platform is designed to protect against increasingly damaging breaches through innovative, identity-centric, context-aware solutions. Our pure-play focus on Zero Trust has enabled us to deliver the highest ranked current Zero Trust Network Access offering as determined by the Forrester New Wave™: Zero Trust Network Access, Q3 2021.
Legacy security platforms continue to fail. Secure access has always been essential to establishing trust between users and technologies. We believe that the Zero Trust framework secures all primary use cases including customer, employee, partner, cloud and Internet of Things (“IoT”). It is a framework for securing infrastructure and data for today’s modern digital environment. Legacy security models, such as virtual private network (“VPN”), give users unnecessarily wide, unrestricted and overprivileged network access. This enables attackers to move easily within organizations and cause tremendous damage. In contrast, Zero Trust is designed to transform security by granting users access to only those resources that are needed to do their job at a particular time and place. Zero Trust uniquely addresses the modern challenges of today’s business, including securing remote workers, controlling access to cloud environments, and defending against ransomware threats.
This new Zero Trust paradigm is needed today because enterprises are undergoing digital transformation as they seek to automate operations, generate new revenue streams, transition business models and deliver a seamless customer experience. Digital transformation, driven by growth in cloud computing, Software as a Service (“SaaS”), mobile devices, IoT, and similar technologies, as well as the increasing prevalence of remote work, has changed the nature of cybersecurity risks by proliferating the number of entry points to organizations’ networks. This is often referred to as “increasing the attack surface”. Simultaneously, the number and sophistication of cyberattacks have increased dramatically, as has their costs and frequency. This combination of more vulnerable networks and more malicious activity has created a cybersecurity crisis, changing the threat landscape organizations face. As a result, enterprises require security access solutions that proactively ensure the right user has authorized access to the right resources at the right time.
We have built a Zero Trust platform which, we believe, is a critical, central pillar of a modern cyber security architecture that will replace legacy perimeter-centric security solutions and is designed to address the current cybersecurity crisis. These legacy solutions are insufficient to secure organizations, their infrastructure and their data. By contrast, we believe that our Zero Trust solutions secure an enterprise’s exponentially increased attack surface, which occurs as a result of their digital transformation journey. We also offer digital threat protection and risk-based authentication tools to identify and eliminate attacks before they occur, across social media, phishing attacks, bogus websites, and malicious mobile apps.
Our solutions give our customers the ability to lower costs and increase efficiency, while improving compliance and providing security that is persistent, identity-centric and context-aware. Our platform enables enterprises to leverage existing investments in IT and security infrastructure. The subsequent cost savings and returns on investments include: leveraging existing network security controls to effectively apply policies, using a service desk business process to control network access and automating cloud security with a Zero Trust framework.
We are pioneering Zero Trust access across all environments, including public cloud, private cloud, multi-cloud, on-premises or permutations of all of the above and believe its rapid adoption signals the early stages of a long-term shift away from legacy perimeter-centric security solutions. We believe our purpose-built capabilities address the hybrid, cloud, and on-premises network security markets, which Gartner estimates was approximately a combined $39 billion market opportunity in 2021, expected to grow at a 14% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) to reach approximately $57 billion by 2024. Gartner has also stated that Zero Trust Network Access remains a dynamic space, with 2021 global market revenue exceeding 60% growth over 2020, and expected to almost triple from 2021 through 2025. We also believe a subset of our capabilities address the Fraud Detection and Prevention (“FDP”) market, which, according to Global Market Insights, was a $30 billion market in 2022 and is expected to grow at a 25% CAGR from 2023-2032.
Our leadership in Zero Trust has also been recognized by third party research firms. Forrester, the firm that originally coined the term “Zero Trust,” named us a leader in the Forrester New Wave™ for Zero Trust Network Access report (September 2021). The report highlighted our ability to address cloud, on-premises and hybrid IT models, noting that Appgate “Software Defined Perimeter”, or SDP, “is the best fit for companies that need high security and a self-hosted option. Appgate offers its Zero Trust Network Access (“ZTNA”) as a SaaS, but also as a self-hosted option for enterprises and agencies that need it.” Separately, Forrester also named us a leader in their initial Forrester Wave™ Zero Trust eXtended Ecosystem report (September 2020). The report noted that Appgate serves mega-enterprises and Department of Defense (“DoD”) customers, which we believe is a testament to our capabilities and positions us well to benefit from the rising demand for Zero Trust solutions.
We believe our solutions address the complex needs of global enterprises and governments. Our go-to-market strategy consists of both direct sales and indirect channel partners. As of December 31, 2022, we served approximately 650 organizations across approximately 70 countries, including domestic and international government agencies and Fortune 500 enterprises that include at least one of the largest companies by revenue in each of the defense contracting, telecommunications, systems integrator, and oil and gas sectors. 
We sell our solutions primarily through a recurring revenue license model or subscription, and employ a ‘land and expand’ strategy to generate incremental revenue through the addition of new users and the sale of additional products. We believe the success of our strategy is validated by our strong dollar-based net retention rates. Our dollar based net retention rates were 96% and 114% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) was $33.7 million and $31.1 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Business Metrics” for additional information regarding ARR.
We achieved revenue of over $40.0 million in each of 2022 and 2021. We continue to invest in growing our business and, as a result, we incurred losses from continuing operations of $54.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $80.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Industry Background
Digital Transformation has Upended Traditional IT Architectures and Environments
Rapidly accelerating digitization has transformed traditional IT architectures, and organizations are confronting the need—indeed the requirement—to transform their business models and environments from legacy, standalone, static systems, and applications, to more dynamic, cloud-native, distributed solutions. For decades, IT environments were defined by company-owned devices operating on company-owned or controlled infrastructure and networks. However, the explosion of the internet, rise of cloud computing, and the proliferation of workloads and mobile devices has upended the legacy IT infrastructure model.
•Proliferation of the cloud and the rise of “as-a-service” solutions. Organizations have embraced cloud-based “as-a-service” delivery models to empower employees and customers and increase the speed of deployment. According to Gartner, more than 85% of organizations will embrace a cloud first principle by 2025 and will not be able to fully execute on their digital strategies without the use of cloud-native architectures and technologies. IDC forecasts the global public cloud services market to grow to approximately $809 billion in 2025 from $385 billion in 2021. These types of environments have massively increased the complexity of IT infrastructure and expanded the scope of the corporate network. This is especially true as enterprises increasingly adopt powerful but complex Infrastructure and Platform as a service (IaaS and PaaS) for the development and deployment of custom and mission-critical business applications.
•Work from anywhere and bring your own device (“BYOD”). Organizations now expect their workers to securely move from place-to-place and device-to-device without losing productivity. These same workers are also now encouraged, and often expected, to use their own devices for work-related activities. The work from anywhere, BYOD culture, with employees accessing corporate applications on their personal laptops, tablets, and smartphones, has accelerated over a number of years and now appears permanent. Businesses have been forced to adjust their IT environments in response to these trends and are faced with employee devices that lack the level of control and security of company-owned devices. As a result, the corporate network has been extended well beyond the secure boundaries of a corporate office, leaving it significantly more exposed to cyberthreats.
•Connected devices and the internet of things (“IoT”). From mobile devices to cameras and sensors, the number of devices on a corporate network has multiplied exponentially over the last few years and is expected to continue growing rapidly due to new technologies such as 5G and the business and technical benefits delivered by these new technologies and tools. According to IOT Analytics, the number of connected IoT devices is expected to reach 27 billion by 2025, up from 12.2 billion in 2021. This trend has served to significantly increase the attack surface.
Cybersecurity Threats and Impact Multiplying
The evolution of IT environments coupled with motivated and sophisticated hackers has increased the risk of cybersecurity attacks. Lateral network movement, ransomware, and insecure remote access are resulting in a higher number of attacks of worsening severity with a lengthened time to detection. According to Secureworks’ 2022 State of the Threat, ransomware remains the primary threat facing organizations. 
•Expanded attack surfaces. As IT environments have evolved, the adoption of hybrid, multi-cloud, BYOD, and IoT, as well as the massive shift to remote work, has altered the nature of cybersecurity risks by growing exponentially the number of entry points to organizations’ networks. With each new user, connection, device, or online interaction, the attack surface, the scope of network vulnerabilities, and the likelihood of network infiltration all increase. The increased attack surface also serves as a source of increased complexity for enterprise defenders. To date, traditional security tools and strategies have not kept up with this increased complexity.
•Lateral movement. Once a hacker penetrates a network, their ability to move laterally allows them to travel extensively throughout the network, increasing the volume of data they are able to compromise, and increasing the risk that more sensitive data is exposed. The ability to move laterally and remain undetected for long periods of time in the network is one of the leading drivers behind the high costs of breaches. The 2020 “SolarWinds” attack, which affected as many as 425 of the Fortune 500 and all branches of the US military, highlights the ability of an attacker to leverage lateral movement after breaching an organization’s network. The original breach occurred sometime between March and June of 2020, when clients of SolarWinds downloaded a software update that was infected with malicious code. The perpetrators were then able to move laterally within the networks of these organizations, remaining undetected by traditional perimeter-based network security solutions until December of 2020, providing the hackers with ample time to gather sensitive data and install more malware. In addition to threats caused by external actors, insider threats, typically coming from employees or third-party contractors, also pose a growing security threat to organizations. According to the Ponemon Institute Cost of Insider Threats Global Report, insider incident average cost ranged from $485,000 to $805,000 per incident, with 56% of incidents due to negligence.
•Sophisticated adversaries. Today’s hackers are highly skilled, often backed by well-funded militaries, intelligence services, or criminal organizations and motivated by some combination of financial, criminal, and terrorist objectives. They can launch complex attacks, often executed over multiple steps, starting with an initial breach of the corporate network followed by lateral movement, slowly escalating their privileges to access increasingly critical and proprietary data.
The combination of more vulnerable networks and more malicious activity has created a cybersecurity crisis for organizations. Cybersecurity Ventures expects global cybercrime costs to grow by 15% per year, reaching $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. Cybersecurity breaches can also have a significant impact on society beyond the direct financial costs. This is illustrated by the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in 2021, which resulted in fuel shortages and spikes in gasoline prices across a number of U.S. states, and by the spike in cyberattacks on health care systems during the pandemic, impacting patient care.
Traditional Cybersecurity Tools are Limited in Protecting Against Today’s Threats
Traditional cybersecurity tools are failing to meet the challenge of modern IT environments due to inherent weaknesses in their structure and design philosophy. 
•Implicit trust at the center of traditional perimeter-centric security model. Traditional cybersecurity tools are largely perimeter-centric, focused on securing the boundary between a private network and the public internet. 
This model is built on the notion of implicit trust, which is the assumption that traffic originating from within a private network does not represent a risk. This critical characteristic allows for lateral movement, giving infiltrators the ability to remain undetected as they move across a network, causing widespread and costly damage. According to the IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report, in 2022 it took an average of 207 days to identify a breach, and another 70 days to contain, giving an attacker plenty of time to cause significant financial and reputational damage to an organization. While this perimeter-centric approach worked historically when enterprise networks had fewer points of entry, today’s IT environments and distributed workloads have softened the network perimeter, blunting the effectiveness of the perimeter-centric security model.
•Outdated tools are siloed and lack context awareness. Traditional security tools such as VPNs, firewall equipment, and network access control (“NAC”) equipment are outdated, siloed, have well-known and widely exploited vulnerabilities, and are unable to properly secure a modern IT environment. These tools employ an outdated model of a single network perimeter entry point and broad network access privileges. VPNs inherently have a “coarse-grained” access control model, granting or denying users access to broad sections of the network, and lack context-aware, fine-grained security permissions, resulting in increased severity of any breach.
•Cybersecurity defenses are overly complex. Organizations often deploy numerous cybersecurity tools from various vendors, reactively deploying new tools in response to emerging threats. This has left many organizations with a patchwork cybersecurity model consisting of a mix of tools from a range of vendors, typically with poor integration and communication among tools, lacking an integrated cybersecurity solution with a unified control point. The resulting complexity makes it challenging for IT professionals to manage the tools effectively and offers poor visibility into potential vulnerabilities and breaches. The need for a new paradigm and approach to cybersecurity is crucial to protect organizations from adversaries and to avoid costly network breaches.
Cybersecurity Defense is Shifting to a Context-Aware, Dynamic Security Model
Zero Trust represents a paradigm shift in cybersecurity. It moves from the legacy static, network-based, perimeter-centric security model to a dynamic, context-aware model based on users, identities, applications, and business processes. The foundation of the Zero Trust model is the idea that no person, device, or application should be implicitly trusted, and that the entire extended network represents an attack surface.
Why a Zero Trust Framework Works
•Eliminates the need for implicit trust. Zero Trust eliminates the need for the implicit trust that is often granted based on physical or network location, and instead requires that all access be identity-driven and earned via dynamic attributes and strong authentication.
•Context-aware and secure access privileges. The Zero Trust model grants users access only to specific and required resources unlike the traditional security model designed on the premise of implicit trust where users are given overprivileged access and can move laterally within a network. Users are continuously monitored, and if their context or device changes, network access can be revised accordingly or revoked entirely. This approach represents a paradigm shift in the cybersecurity posture, increasing organizational resiliency when facing attacks and better equipping them to isolate and limit the impact of any network breach.
Zero Trust framework has emerged as the clear answer to today’s cybersecurity threats. Following the “SolarWinds” attack, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”), the National Security Agency (“NSA”) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) released guidance recommending a Zero Trust framework. Subsequently, in May 2021, President Joe Biden issued an Executive Order explicitly calling for the adoption of a Zero Trust Architecture by the federal government to improve the nation’s response to “persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns that threaten the public sector, the private sector, and ultimately the American people’s security and privacy.” The federal government continues to lead the industry in setting standards with ongoing work and publications by CISA, NIST, the U.S. Department of Defense, and others. These include a multi-vendor integration and architecture initiative led by NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, which Appgate was one of the participating vendors.
With an increasingly threatening landscape, to ensure security every organization and government in the world will need to update their traditional cybersecurity tools with a solution that is able to stand up to today’s threats. We believe that the Zero Trust framework has established itself as that solution and represents the next generation cybersecurity solution.
Our Solutions
We provide identity-centric and context-aware Zero Trust access solutions that ensure security and compliance across all environments, including on-premises, hybrid, and cloud-native. We also offer a digital threat protection and risk-based authentication and comprehensive risk management tool designed to identify and eliminate attacks before they occur, across social media, phishing attacks, bogus websites, and malicious mobile apps. The following combination of software and services are increasingly the central pillar of our customers’ cybersecurity architecture:
•Appgate Software-Defined Perimeter (“SDP”). Appgate SDP, leveraging unified access policies that are simple to understand and write, is designed to ensure trusted network access for users across all devices and IT environments, whether on-premises, hybrid or cloud-based. Unlike legacy solutions where users manually and constantly switch VPN tunnels to establish secure connections, SDP users connect once and gain access only to authorized applications across a heterogeneous and distributed IT landscape. SDP defends our customers’ networks from wrongful access and continuously monitors for changes in user behavior once a connection is made. In order to prevent lateral movement from unauthorized users, the network remains invisible, exposing no ports, until a user is authenticated and connected. Once authenticated and on the network, SDP employs the principles of “least-privileged access,” granting limited access, only to the extent required. Access is conditional and based on multiple factors, and if SDP detects changes during the online session, the user can be denied access in part or in full. The most common Appgate SDP use cases include VPN replacement for remote access, securing cloud access, supporting cloud migrations, securely providing third-party access, secure Development and Operations (“DevOps”), and integrating Merger & Acquisition (“M&A”) assets into a secure network environment. Appgate SDP supports customer choice of deployment models, including hosting it within Appgate’s cloud-native Zero Trust Platform, having customers deploy in a self-hosted model, or hybrid.
•Risk-Based Authentication (“RBA”). RBA offers an intelligent and contextually aware approach to authenticating users and approving transactions without friction. Legacy password-only solutions are a weak authentication measure that unintentionally creates friction for enterprise customers. By contrast, our RBA approach uses real-time behavioral risk assessments, context-based authentication and machine learning, all designed to protect individuals against targeted attacks. Transactions and user behavior are continuously monitored to qualify the risk on any channel. Should the RBA solution determine the person attempting to access their account is illegitimate, transactions can be blocked or challenged in real-time, preventing account takeover.
•Digital Threat Protection (“DTP”). Our DTP solution is designed to combat external threats targeting consumers across social, mobile and the dark web, including phishing links, malicious mobile apps, and fraudulent websites. DTP continuously monitors activity, provides early-stage warnings, orchestrates takedowns and can proactively stop attacks before damage is done, often before intended victims are aware.
•Threat Advisory Services. Our Threat Advisory Services are designed to proactively identify vulnerabilities and validate defenses using a combination of advanced penetration testing, adversary simulation and other customized services. We use highly sophisticated, bespoke processes based on the individual needs of our customers to simulate nation-state-level and other complex attacks. These engagements help organizations test and validate the security investments they’ve made and act as an opportunity to implement our software solutions based on remediation recommendations as we help our customers accelerate their Zero Trust journey. Threat Advisory Services are an important tool in our pursuit to future proof our customers’ defenses against malicious activity, as they allow us to gain real-time information from our services engagements to stay up to date on evolving cybersecurity threats. We leverage this data to inform our software technology roadmap, helping us effectively address our customers’ expanding security needs.
Key Benefits
Our platform based on Zero Trust principles is scalable, integrates with disparate security and non-security solutions and operates in any complex IT environment. Our platform empowers organizations to undertake their digital transformation 
journey and enables development and operations teams to collaborate, quickly build and improve applications and drive business performance. Key benefits of our solutions include:
•Enhanced network security based on Zero Trust. As a pioneer, leader, and one of the earliest proponents of Zero Trust, we have built and honed a pure-play platform based on Zero Trust principles to facilitate secure interactions for organizations, users, and their devices. Our solutions use the principles of Zero Trust to strengthen network security, making it harder for adversaries to attack a network. Additionally, if a breach occurs, an attacker’s lateral movement is restricted so the attacker can be identified and swiftly contained, potentially limiting overall damage and exposure.
•Effective across all environments. Organizations require infrastructure to support on-premises, hybrid, cloud, IoT, BYOD, and other disparate platforms. Our identity-centric and context-aware solution dynamically adjusts to changes in user behavior across all interconnected environments. Many organizations have a patchwork of products that are often poorly integrated, creating additional complexity, security gaps, and administrative burden, creating an opportunity for our solutions. We believe we were among the first to identify the need for and deliver an enterprise class, software-based, unifying solution that dynamically works across all environments to become an organization’s executive team’s cyber-defense partner.
•Greater flexibility for customers and their users. Our solutions offer fast, secure, direct connections from any location, enabling increasingly popular remote workforce models. Unlike perimeter-based approaches, our SDP platform uses a dynamic identity-centric policy model to connect users from any device in any location. While remote workforce models typically expand security risk, our security architecture is designed to ensure that increased workforce mobility does not create incremental vulnerable access points. Appgate SDP can be deployed as-a-Service (hosted in the Appgate cloud environment) or deployed completely within customer environments.
•Strong integration capabilities. Our solutions can be deployed alongside existing security systems and across the entire IT environment. We utilize what we believe is the broadest set of APIs for Zero Trust in the industry to enable our products to coordinate and communicate with other IT systems and improve the interoperability with existing security infrastructure. Through integration with our Zero Trust security solution, customers have the potential to extend both the reach and value of their existing security and non-security tools. We believe this value proposition enables a faster purchasing decision and differs from “next generation” security solutions that require an overhaul of a customer’s existing security system architecture.
•Lower total cost of ownership. Adoption of our user-friendly software solutions frequently leads to improved operational efficiency for organizations. A survey of our customers by independent analyst firm Nemertes concluded that all respondents reported improvements in one or more key operational metrics, including average user provisioning time, average number of staff required for user provisioning, average login time, number of security incidents and trouble tickets and number of concurrent users, after adopting our solutions.
•Simplified and more effective security model. We allow system administrators to create a single set of access policies that can be used uniformly across multiple disparate environments, increasing ease of use, operational efficiency, and security. This is in sharp contrast to not only traditionally siloed products, such as VPNs and NACs, but also many other ZTNA providers, who utilize static versus dynamic security rules, or who cannot secure access for on-premises users.
•Seamless end user experience. We provide automatic, dynamic access without having to frequently engage with the end user or disrupt workflow processes. Users are authenticated the same way regardless of where they are located or what device they are using. This approach differs from, and can be a replacement for, inflexible tools like VPNs and static multi-factor authentication systems, which often require users to re-authenticate themselves routinely, frustrating users.
•Complex fraud prevention. We offer consumer-facing organizations a comprehensive set of solutions based on Zero Trust principles to prevent fraud. Powered by machine learning and behavioral analytics designed to identify and prevent fraudulent activities, we assess risk based on user behavior to authenticate connections. Our proprietary technology is focused on detecting and deactivating targeted external threats which utilize phishing links, malicious mobile apps, or fraudulent websites. We continuously analyze and monitor an array of digital channels to identify threats, and execute site take-downs, often before intended victims are aware. Finally, we 
provide rich insights on potential victims, so organizations can be better prepared to stop future complex fraud campaigns.

We believe these high-profile recognitions received from trusted industry experts have elevated our reputation with existing and prospective customers.
•Highly scalable ‘land and expand’ go-to-market (“GTM”) strategy driving C-Suite engagement. We leverage a ‘land and expand’ GTM strategy that can scale rapidly as we demonstrate value to customers and achieve broader deployment across their infrastructure. We deploy an integrated technical sales approach complemented by channel partners, such as Lumen, Optiv, Presidio, Guidepoint Security, DXC, TechMatrix, SageNet, Q2, Alkami, Carahsoft, Ingram, GBM, CLM and Kite, which helps us meet the needs of our expanding customer base. This GTM approach is turbocharged by our battle-tested sales engineering team, which can help demonstrate the value of our solutions to stakeholders outside of the IT organization. We believe that cybersecurity has become a key business issue for executives, not just an area of concern for IT professionals; our ability to elevate conversations to a strategic level and secure buy-in from all stakeholders is a critical differentiator, unlocking broader deployment of our solutions.
•Strong customer focus. We are a trusted, long-term, strategic partner to our customers. In a Nemertes survey of our customers, 100% of respondents said Appgate accelerated their digital transformation, and of those implementing Appgate SDP, our importance to their strategy ranked 9.5 out of 10. These strong customer satisfaction metrics stem from our customer success team’s close collaboration with clients throughout their journey as a customer, communicating frequently with them through quarterly business reviews, supporting them as novel issues and use cases arise, and constantly seeking feedback to drive improvement in our solutions. We also continue to hold regular Customer Advisory Board meetings, which provide an open dialogue with customers to ensure that we prioritize, understand, and adapt to their changing needs. Our current customer base includes at least one of the largest companies by revenue in each of the defense contracting, telecommunications, systems integrator and oil and gas sectors, validating our customer-focused strategy.
•Seamless API-based integration. Our solutions offer feature-rich, easy-to-use APIs that allow for integration with existing solutions, which enables our customers to drive more value from their in-place solutions. Our APIs facilitate quick deployment alongside existing security solutions, from which threat data and context can be extracted, and are used to enrich our risk scoring and authentication decisions. We continue to partner with other cybersecurity vendors, such as Crowdstrike and others, to deepen the abilities of our API integrations. In addition, Appgate recently introduced new no-code integrations within our cloud-native security services, running in the Appgate Zero Trust Platform. This further improves our integration capabilities, and makes it easier for customers to benefit from it.
•Deep management strength with extensive cybersecurity experience. Our seasoned executives were among the earliest pioneers in Zero Trust security. Our senior management team has extensive expertise in the cybersecurity 
industry with deep knowledge of the markets in which we operate. With an average of over 20 years of experience in the enterprise technology and cybersecurity space, our highly accomplished management team demonstrate a historical track record of success and are devoted to the continued growth and success of our business.
Our Opportunity
As organizations reshape their IT infrastructure around hybrid, multi-cloud, SaaS, mobility, IoT, BYOD, containerized workloads, and with remote working environments and cyber threats rising rapidly, the need for a new security model is increasingly mission-critical for many enterprises. Zero Trust security is emerging as the leading next generation security model and we believe we are a pioneer in this transforming industry and are well-positioned to capitalize on the market opportunity.
•Hybrid, multi-cloud, and on-premises network security. Gartner estimates this aggregate market was approximately $39 billion in 2021, expected to grow at a 14% CAGR to approximately $57 billion by 2024. According to Cisco’s May 2022 Global Hybrid Cloud Trends Report, 82% of IT leaders say that they have adopted the hybrid cloud. Our SDP platform is designed to ensure trusted access for all corporate users across all environments.
•VPN replacement. Gartner predicts that at least 70% of new remote access deployments will be served predominantly by ZTNA as opposed to VPN services by 2025, up from less than 10% at the end of 2021, and that 60% of enterprises will phase out their remote access VPN in favor of ZTNA by 2023. Our SDP platform offers secure VPN replacement across all environments including hybrid, multi-cloud, and on-premises.
•Secure Access Service Edge (“SASE”). SASE refers to integrated security and network solutions that secure IT environments. According to Gartner, the global SASE market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 36% reaching almost $15 billion by 2025. We believe that ZTNA is the most critical element of SASE given its role in regulating network access, and our SDP platform is a recognized leader in ZTNA.
•Fraud Detection and Prevention (“FDP”). Organizations and individuals face a growing set of active and targeted phishing campaigns, as well as increased use of malicious websites and mobile apps for criminal purposes. The growth in these threats is underpinned by continued expansion of online banking, e-commerce, and Peer-to-Peer (“P2P”) payment applications. According to Fortune Business Insights, the FDP market was estimated at approximately $25.7 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach approximately $129.2 billion by 2029, representing a 22.8% CAGR. Ensuring that their customers aren’t deceived by fraudulent websites, phishing campaigns, or mobile apps is critical to businesses’ reputations, and our RBA and DTP solutions are designed to address these threats and we believe are critical tools in the FDP ecosystem. Illustrating the imminent need for fraud prevention, the Federal Trade Commission reported that Americans lost over $5.8 billion to fraud in 2021, an increase of over 70% from 2020.
We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the market opportunity to displace legacy network security solutions, which are ill-equipped to effectively secure cloud or hybrid IT environments, and the use of which increases entry points for adversaries and the risk of network breaches.
Growth Strategies
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Continue to grow customer base. We believe our solutions are well positioned to serve not only large, security-conscious organizations with complex, hybrid IT environments, but also medium and small sized customers. We believe scaling our sales team and increasing our investment in channels and strategic partners will fuel our customer base growth.
•Increase adoption within our existing customers. We utilize a ‘land and expand’ strategy through which we expand existing customer accounts by adding new use cases or more users, including third-party users and contractors. We expect many of our existing SDP customers to use our network of other software and services, driving growth.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, international sales represented approximately 49% of our revenue. We believe global demand for our offerings will continue to increase as international organizations further embrace Zero Trust access solutions in response to evolving cybersecurity threats and sophisticated adversaries. While we expect our international markets to continue to grow, we anticipate the growth in North America to outpace that of international markets.
•Expand our channel and product partnerships. Our Zero Trust solutions are highly complementary to a number of other cybersecurity products, and as such, we have built a number of highly strategic product and go-to-market partnerships. Our products are easy to deploy and can be distributed by value-added resellers and service providers. We have strong channel partnerships with Lumen, Optiv, Presidio, Guidepoint Security, DXC, TechMatrix, SageNet, Q2, Alkami, Carahsoft, Ingram, GBM, CLM, and Kite, among others and work closely with federal systems integrators such as Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and ManTech, each of whom are building out solutions around our products for wider distribution. We also continue to work with technology alliance partners to offer integrated solutions to our customers. For example, Appgate has a partnership with CrowdStrike, integrating our Appgate SDP solution, with the CrowdStrike Falcon Zero Trust Assessment (ZTA) capability of CrowdStrike Falcon Insight EDR. This flexible, scalable integration provides a frictionless path for accelerating enterprise Zero Trust journeys. It will help organizations achieve intelligence-aware and dynamic secure access policy enforcement — reducing their attack surface and mitigating lateral movement on their networks. CrowdStrike Falcon ZTA expands Zero Trust beyond authentication to enable Appgate’s detection, alerting and enforcement of risk-based access policies driven by device health and compliance checks. The solution monitors many endpoint settings to deliver partners a device security posture assessment, allowing them to build powerful and granular security policies.
•Expand our presence with U.S. federal governments and governments around the world. With NIST, the White House, and other agencies endorsing the adoption of Zero Trust, we expect to have ample opportunities to leverage our early and continued success with the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security and to build trust with other government agencies and departments. Our SDP solution was the first SDP product to be Common Criteria Certified, which is the international “gold standard” for Information Technology security. Common Criteria is recognized by approximately 30 nations and was developed by the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. Appgate has government customers across the world.
Our Technology and Architecture
Appgate’s cybersecurity solutions empower and protect how people work and connect. Our solutions are designed to enhance security, limit the ability of attackers to succeed, and minimize damage in the event of a breach. We recognize that IT, business, and security infrastructures are complex and can act as impediments to innovation, security, efficiency, and effectiveness. Organizations need security solutions that can be easily and effectively deployed and integrated into their existing environments.
Our solutions are designed with customer integration and customer success in mind, and this philosophy has influenced our technology architecture. We believe that customers should retain the choice of where and how to deploy their security infrastructure, enforce access, and route traffic. As such, we have designed and built our solutions to support secure access to the cloud and on-premises.
Appgate SDP
Our flagship Zero Trust Network Access solution, Appgate SDP, is designed to secure enterprise environments by applying the core principles of Zero Trust. Using Appgate SDP, our customers have successfully achieved enterprise Zero Trust security, at scale and with speed, integrated into their IT and security teams, business processes, and technologies. With Appgate SDP, enterprises can eliminate weak and ineffective components of their security architecture (such as VPNs), while integrating with and obtaining more value from the remaining components (such as Identity Management and IT Service Management).
Appgate SDP is designed to provide enterprise-class ZTNA capabilities, providing a highly resilient system with no single point of failure, and near wire speed throughput. Its distributed architecture makes SDP easy to scale and deploy across any network infrastructure, including hardware, software, virtual, and cloud. It enables complete customer control over deployment topologies and location of policy enforcement points and can be deployed in a customer-hosted, or Appgate-hosted SaaS model. Its secure multi-tunnel approach is designed with users at the center, dynamically creating a session-based micro-perimeter dedicated to each user — what we term a “segment of one”. This allows for an efficient, secure, and resilient connection to the permitted set of enterprise resources. This compares favorably to traditional security and remote access solutions, which often force user traffic to traverse a vendor cloud or enterprise WAN, resulting in poor performance, limited scalability, and the perpetuation of a weak security model. In addition to controlling access to enterprise resources through Zero Trust policy enforcement points, the Appgate SDP system itself is cloaked and invisible to unauthorized users, utilizing a cryptographic mechanism termed Single-Packet Authorization (SPA). SPA is designed to ensure that legitimate users can securely access resources from any location, without exposing any attack surface to malicious actors.
The Appgate SDP architecture is fully aligned with the NIST Zero Trust model, which contains the following fundamental principles:
•No implicit trust. There is no inherent trust or access granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location — the model instead assumes a network has already been breached.
•Authentication and authorization required before access is granted. Authentication and authorization are discrete functions performed before any access to an enterprise resource is permitted. This applies to users, servers and devices.
•Minimal attack surface (principle of least privilege). All users, devices, and networks only permit access to the minimal set of resources, and only for authenticated and authorized users. This applies to all users (remote and on-premises), all devices (enterprise-issued and BYOD), and all resource types (on-premises, cloud-based, physical, or virtual). The system, and all enterprise resources, are cloaked and invisible to all unauthorized actors.
•Dynamic, identity-centric policies. The focus is on protecting specific resources (assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc.), not broad network segments. Access policies dynamically evaluate user, device, network, and resource attributes to make decisions about whether access should be permitted at any given point in time.
Deployment Architecture
The Appgate SDP deployment architecture is comprised of the following five elements.
A.Client. The user of a resource (described below). In the typical Appgate SDP use case, the client is an organization’s employee seeking to access an application from a PC or mobile device.
B.Controller. Effectively the brain of the system, the controller houses the enterprise policy model (the rules used to determine which users should have access to which resources), aggregates the information required to enforce the enterprise policy model, and then makes an authentication and authorization decision.
C.Gateway. Policy enforcement points that restrict access to resources until a client is authorized.
D.Enterprise Systems. Sources of information about a user and context used to make authentication and authorization decisions.
E.Resource. Any application, server, network, IoT device, containerized workload, etc. that can be located in any cloud or on-premises environment.
A conceptional depiction and description of the Appgate SDP deployment architecture are as follows:
1.The Client first connects to the Controller.
2.The Controller begins by authenticating the user with the enterprise identity provided. It then aggregates all relevant data from the Enterprise Systems, including information about both (a) the user’s identity, location, and device security posture and (b) contextual information from the organization’s network, security, and business process systems. The Controller then uses this information to determine which resources the user should have access to at that particular time and place.
3.The Controller generates and sends a live entitlement token to the user. An entitlement token is an electronic credential that indicates which resources a user should have access to. The entitlement token is “live” because it can change based on changes in context.
4.The Client creates an encrypted tunnel to a Gateway and sends the live entitlement token to the Gateway for validation.
5.The Gateway creates a logical “segment of one” to connect the Client to the specific resource(s) to which the Client has been granted access.
6.The system continuously evaluates context and changes entitlements based on changes to context. For example, if a user disconnects their laptop from a docking station, the system will detect the change from a hard-wired network connection to a public Wi-Fi connection. Or, if an enterprise Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) system detects anomalous activity from a user’s device, it can inform Appgate SDP. In both cases, Appgate SDP will re-evaluate user access based on this changed context.
The components of the Appgate SDP platform itself, the Controllers and Gateways, utilize a cryptographic mechanism to cloak themselves from unauthorized users. This mechanism is designed to ensure that these components can be accessed by legitimate users located anywhere, while remaining resilient and inaccessible to unauthorized use or malicious actors.
In addition, Appgate SDP’s architecture is designed to ensure that customers retain the ability to choose how and where their network traffic is routed (some customers use Appgate SDP as an SD-WAN replacement as a result), and how and where to deploy Gateways. Gateways are distributed across their organizations’ environments, protecting both on-premises and cloud-based environments. Similarly, the distributed nature of the Appgate SDP system provides a unified access control model for all users (both remote and on-premises) for all resources, using a single policy model and a single platform. As a result, customers benefit by being able to decommission ineffective siloed and legacy security technologies (such as VPNs and NACs), replacing them with a modern Zero Trust platform.
Deployment Options
Appgate SDP supports a wide variety of deployment models and access methods designed to provide for ongoing customer satisfaction. Customers may choose to deploy entirely in a self-hosted and self-managed model, or they may utilize the Appgate-hosted and managed as-a-Service model, using Appgate’s cloud-native Zero Trust platform, to take advantage of its simpler deployment and management.
These options are shown in the following diagram which depicts Hosted and Connected options for customer deployments of Appgate SDP. For those enterprises that require such a model, Appgate SDP may also be deployed in a model that is disconnected from the Appgate cloud environment.
In addition to the many types of resources that need securing, organizations also have a wide variety of end-user populations and types, and the Appgate SDP platform provides an industry-leading set of access methods. Users can access Appgate SDP-protected resources via installed client software, through a clientless web portal, or through a network-based connector service. Likewise, Appgate SDP adeptly meets complex enterprise and government agency networking needs, including dynamic and policy-based control of network segmentation, routing, and name resolution. Appgate SDP is designed to deliver superior security while also improving the end user experience and reducing administrative burdens.
Digital Threat Protection
Our Digital Threat Protection (“DTP”) solution offers visibility and comprehensive fraud risk management to identify and eliminate attacks before they occur. DTP is designed to evaluate fraud risk across social media, phishing attacks, bogus websites, and malicious mobile apps. Its curated threat intelligence and continuous threat monitoring provides protection throughout the fraud risk lifecycle. Additionally, DTP provides business leaders with valuable proactive detection, mitigation, and reporting functionality for their end-users.
DTP combats external threats by detecting fraud risk lurking online, continuously monitoring brand-centric activity, and taking swift action to halt attacks before significant damage occurs, often before the intended victims are even aware of the attack.
•Phishing. Our DTP solution monitors customer websites as well as newly registered domains, DNS entries, and links posted on social media sites, looking for similar domains or clones of legitimate sites that may be phishing sites. This monitoring extends to mobile app stores, where DTP can detect rogue mobile apps designed to deceive users. We also offer Victim Insights, a unique and differentiated feature which utilizes an encrypted key to identify users and compromised credentials, enabling rapid and precise responses.
•Dark web monitoring. Our DTP solution protects against attacks originating from the dark web by identifying employee credentials that have been breached and are circulating on the dark web and mitigating the effects of targeted threats by reporting risk exposure to ensure quick action against exposed data.
•Sophisticated attacks. Our DTP solution is designed to identify and immobilize sophisticated threats, such as web injections and credential grabbing on transactional websites, without requiring software installation on user devices. It provides detection of unauthorized changes executed against the content of a company’s website and features built-in analytical systems, which evaluate users’ sessions to identify indicia of fraud that indicate potential breach of users accounts by cybercriminals.
Our DTP solution is deployed in our cloud-hosted environment, ensuring that customers have a high degree of confidence in its availability and scalability. It is monitored and operated by our 24x7 Security Operations Center (“SOC”) team, who detect and respond to fraud risk events in near real-time. By combining automated analysis of detected fraud attempts with skilled SOC operators, DTP customers benefit from automated monitoring and manual follow-up, including threat analysis and verification, and initiation of malicious site takedowns with relevant parties, including ISPs, registrars, and mobile app operators.
These services are facilitated through our web-application online portal, which allows customers to see the results of our efforts in real-time. This portal includes ticketing functionality, providing customers with details of identified threats including employee credentials harvested and IP address and domain details exposed; the portal also allows customers to request support from the SOC agents. Threat tracking maps and social media feeds are also available to customers if they want to examine DTP’s raw data feeds.
Risk-Based Authentication
Our Risk-Based Authentication (“RBA”) solution combines advanced authentication techniques, such as multi-factor authentication, and behavioral analytics based on machine learning and AI algorithms. This helps customers model and monitor risk with dynamic and flexible rules and to authorize transactions and prevent fraud for institutions. For example, RBA enables financial institutions to detect and take action on risky transactions more accurately, while reducing friction facing end users. RBA enables authentication through push technologies, SMS text, One-Time-Passwords, email verification two-step responses, and QR code enrollment, allowing end user customization based on individual preferences.
Our RBA solution offers our customers flexible deployment options. It can be deployed wholly into customer environments for local integration or into an Appgate-managed cloud environment for simpler deployment and management, as illustrated in the below diagram. RBA also features a risk orchestration tool running on the back end to enable simplified integration of multiple solutions and to map conditional workflows, enabling authentication challenges through device identification when fraud risk is determined by our transaction anomaly detection solution. Our behavioral biometrics and device analytics also provide a level of authentication and can tie into step-up authentication methods as required.

Solution: Chewy selected us as its preferred partner due to both our high-quality software, as well as our agility and ability to scale with its rapidly growing business. During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chewy worked with us to rapidly implement our SDP solution to authenticate and authorize Chewy’s team members prior to allowing access to any resources from remote locations. After a successful initial deployment, Chewy chose our SDP solution for its Zero Trust solution to enable secure and seamless work-from-anywhere in a post-COVID world.
DXC
Situation: DXC is a leading end-to-end IT services company, with, as of March 31, 2022, over $16 billion in annual revenue and over 130,000 employees across approximately 70 countries. DXC needed to provide its employees and customers with seamless remote access to DXC’s corporate network and applications, including provisioning of access to different resources based on each user’s entitlement rules and device compliance status. It was critical for network traffic to be routed on the most efficient path to individual applications and network endpoints, with multiple concurrent connections when necessary. Additionally, DXC had sold significant IP address space to Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), resulting in significant IP conflicts that needed to be resolved.
Solution: DXC selected our SDP solution to replace its traditional VPNs from multiple vendors. This allowed the company to move all of its users off of its corporate network, retiring multiprotocol label switching (“MPLS”) and private networking resources and transitioning to ZTNA-based network infrastructure. This provided not only a higher level of network security, but also the ability to retire traditional network resources, leading to significant cost savings. DXC is also heavily leveraging Appgate SDP’s DNS forwarding capability, addressing the massive IP overlap that DXC faced due to significant M&A activity.
Fifth Third Bank
Situation: Fifth Third Bank, National Association is an indirect subsidiary of Fifth Third Bancorp and one of the largest banks in the United States, with approximately 19,000 employees and, as of December 31, 2022, operating 1,087 banking centers and approximately 2,000 automated teller machines across 11 states. Under its Technology Leadership initiative, Fifth Third recognized the opportunity to enhance its IT infrastructure and embarked on a strategic Zero Trust initiative and investment in cloud solutions.
Solution: Fifth Third Bank selected Appgate as its partner and purchased 3,000 SDP licenses in the second quarter of 2020. Once recognizing the value of our solution, Fifth Third purchased additional licenses furthering its goal of having our SDP solution deployed on every device remotely accessing its network. Fifth Third plans to direct its focus to on-premises users. We believe Fifth Third’s adoption of our solution demonstrates our successful ‘land and expand’ approach, and our proven success around linear scalability, programmability and extensibility.
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)
Situation: The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is a government-authorized not-for-profit organization that oversees U.S. broker-dealers to protect investors and ensure market integrity. They regulate all equity and option trades in U.S. markets and process peak volumes of 600 billion transactions daily.
Solution: FINRA selected Appgate because it enables them to use dynamic resolvers to retrieve per-user workload information. With approximately 1,000 users, they were able to enforce identity-centric access with strong, context-sensitive authentication.

Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. As of March 15, 2023, we and our wholly-owned subsidiaries had over 73 total issued and pending patents, including in excess of 69 issued patents, in the United States and other countries. Our issued patents expire between 2033 and 2041 and cover various aspects of our solutions. In addition, we have registered “Appgate” as a trademark in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, and we or our wholly-owned subsidiaries have filed trademark registration applications in the United States and/or other jurisdictions for other ancillary marks that we use. We are also the registrant of a domestic domain names that include “Appgate” and variations. In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment or similar agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights through provisions in our subscription and license agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, confidentiality agreements and contractual restrictions in other agreements, unauthorized parties might still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. Further, our patents and other intellectual property rights may not prevent other providers of cybersecurity services from introducing or offering products that compete with or are alternatives to our Zero Trust solutions. In addition to our internally developed technology, we also license software, including open source software, from third parties that we integrate into or bundle with our solutions.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors might try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third-parties may also claim that our security platform and other solutions infringe their intellectual property rights. In particular, some companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these companies and non-practicing entities, have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers or channel partners whom we may be obligated to indemnify against such claims in accordance with terms in our license or other agreements. Successful claims of infringement by a third-party could prevent us from offering certain services or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected subscriptions or services, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — It may be difficult to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our solutions without compensating us.”

Corporate Information and History 
Appgate is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated on September 26, 2005, originally under the name Newtown Lane Marketing, Incorporated. On October 12, 2021, in connection with the Merger (as described below), we changed our name to Appgate, Inc. Appgate’s principal executive offices are located at 2 Alhambra Plaza, Suite PH-1-B, Coral Gables, FL 33134 and our phone number is (866) 524-4782. 
Beginning in 2007, Newtown Lane had been a corporation with limited operations and no revenues, often referred to as a “shell” company, with the sole purpose of serving as a vehicle to acquire an operating business. Prior to the Merger, the operating business of Appgate was operated by Legacy Appgate. Since May 2017, Legacy Appgate was a wholly-owned subsidiary of and operated as a business segment of its former parent, Cyxtera. On December 31, 2019, Cyxtera spun out Legacy Appgate. 
The Merger
On October 12, 2021, we consummated the Merger, which resulted in Legacy Appgate becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Merger, we changed our name from Newtown Lane Marketing, Incorporated to Appgate, Inc., and our business comprises the operations of Legacy Appgate. 
The Merger effected a change of control of the Company, as:
