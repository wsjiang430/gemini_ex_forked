ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 References herein to Blackstone Mortgage Trust, company, we, us, or our refer to Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. 
 Our Company 
 Blackstone Mortgage Trust is a real estate finance company that originates senior loans collateralized by commercial real estate in North America, Europe, and Australia. Our investment objective is to preserve and protect shareholder capital while producing attractive risk-adjusted returns primarily through dividends generated from current income from our loan portfolio. We are externally managed by BXMT Advisors L.L.C., or our Manager, a subsidiary of The Blackstone Group L.P., or Blackstone, and are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol BXMT. Our principal executive offices are located at 345 Park Avenue, 42nd Floor, New York, New York 10154. We were incorporated in Maryland in 1998, when we reorganized from a California common law business trust into a Maryland corporation. 
 We conduct our operations as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain an exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various subsidiaries. We operate our business as one segment, which originates and acquires commercial mortgage loans and related investments. 
 Our Manager 
 We are externally managed and advised by our Manager, which is responsible for administering our business activities, day-to-day operations, and providing us the services of our executive management team, investment team, and appropriate support personnel. 
 Our Manager is a part of Blackstones alternative asset management business, which includes the management of investment vehicles focused on private equity, real estate, public debt and equity, non-investment grade credit, real assets, and secondary funds, all on a global basis. Through its different businesses, Blackstone had total assets under management of $472.2
 billion as of December 31, 2018. 
 In connection with the performance of its duties, our Manager benefits from the resources, relationships, and expertise of the 479 professionals in Blackstones global real estate group, which is one of the largest real estate investment managers in the world with $136.2
 billion of investor capital under management as of December 31, 2018. Kenneth Caplan and Kathleen McCarthy, who are the global co-heads of Blackstones real estate group, are members of our Managers investment committee. 
 Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies, or BREDS, was launched in 2008 within Blackstones global real estate group to pursue opportunities relating to debt and preferred equity investments globally, with a focus primarily on North America and Europe. Michael Nash, the global chairman of BREDS, serves as the executive chairman of our board of directors and is a member of our Managers investment committee. In addition, Jonathan Pollack, the global head of BREDS, serves as one of our directors and is also a member of our Managers investment committee. As of December 31, 2018, 104 dedicated BREDS professionals, including 14 investment professionals based in London and Australia, managed $17.5 billion of investor capital. 
 Our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and other executive officers are senior Blackstone real estate professionals. None of our Manager, our executive officers, or other personnel supplied to us by our Manager is 
 
1 


  obligated to dedicate any specific amount of time to our business. Our Manager is subject to the supervision and oversight of our board of directors and has only such functions and authority as our board of directors delegates to it. Pursuant to a management agreement between our Manager and us, or our Management Agreement, our Manager is entitled to receive a base management fee, an incentive fee, and expense reimbursements. See Notes 12 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements and the information disclosed pursuant to Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence in our definitive proxy statement with respect to our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, which is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detail on the terms of the Management Agreement. 
 Our Investment Strategy 
 Our investment strategy is to originate loans and invest in debt and related instruments supported by institutional quality commercial real estate in attractive locations. Through our Manager, we draw on Blackstones extensive real estate debt investment platform and its established sourcing, underwriting, and structuring capabilities in order to execute our investment strategy. In addition, we have access to Blackstones extensive network and Blackstones substantial real estate and other investment holdings, which provide our Manager access to market data on a scale not available to many competitors. 
 We directly originate, co-originate, and acquire debt instruments in conjunction with acquisitions, refinancings, and recapitalizations of commercial real estate in North America, Europe, and Australia. In the case of loans we acquire, we focus on performing loans that are supported by well-capitalized properties and portfolios. We believe that the scale and flexibility of our capital, as well as our Managers and Blackstones relationships, enables us to target opportunities with strong sponsorship and invest in large loans or other debt that is collateralized by high-quality assets and portfolios. 
 As market conditions evolve over time, we expect to adapt as appropriate. We believe our current investment strategy will produce significant opportunities to make investments with attractive risk-return profiles. However, to capitalize on the investment opportunities that may be present at various other points of an economic cycle, we may expand or change our investment strategy by targeting assets such as subordinate mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, real estate securities and note financings. 
 We believe that the diversification of our investment portfolio, our ability to actively manage those investments, and the flexibility of our strategy positions us to generate attractive returns for our stockholders in a variety of market conditions over the long term. 
 Our Portfolio 
 Our business is currently focused on originating or acquiring senior, floating rate mortgage loans that are secured by a first priority mortgage on commercial real estate assets primarily in the office, hotel, and multifamily sectors in North America, Europe, and Australia. These investments may be in the form of whole loans, pari passu participations within mortgage loans, or other similar structures. Although originating senior, floating rate mortgage loans is our primary area of focus, we also originate and acquire fixed rate loans and subordinate loans, including subordinate mortgage interests and mezzanine loans. This focused lending strategy is designed to generate attractive current income while protecting investors capital.

Total loan exposure encompasses the entire loan we originated and financed, including $446.9 million of such non-consolidated senior interests that are not included in our balance sheet portfolio.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Includes investment exposure to the $1.0 billion 2018 Single Asset Securitization. We do not consolidate the 2018 Single Asset Securitization on our consolidated financial statements, and instead reflect our $99.0 million subordinate risk retention investment as a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Notes 5 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the 2018 Single Asset Securitization.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Unfunded commitments will primarily be funded to finance our borrowers construction or development of real estate-related assets, capital improvements of existing assets, or lease-related expenditures. These commitments will generally be funded over the term of each loan, subject in certain cases to an expiration date.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | As of December 31, 2018, 96% of our loans by total loan exposure earned a floating rate of interest, primarily indexed to USD LIBOR, and 4% earned a fixed rate of interest. Cash coupon and all-in yield assume applicable floating benchmark rates as of December 31, 2018 for weighted-average calculation. In addition to cash coupon, all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination and extension fees, loan origination costs, and purchase discounts, as well as the accrual of exit fees.

Financing Strategy 
 To maintain an adequate amount of available liquidity and execute our business plan, we look to a variety of sources. In addition to raising capital through public offerings of our equity and debt securities, our financing strategy includes credit facilities, asset-specific financings, the GE portfolio acquisition facility, a revolving credit agreement, loan participations sold, non-consolidated senior interests, and securitized debt obligations. In addition to our current mix of financing sources, we also expect to access additional forms of financings including resecuritizations and public and private, secured and unsecured debt issuances by us or our subsidiaries. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued 14,566,743 aggregate shares of our class A common stock through an underwritten public offering and our at-the-market program, providing aggregate net proceeds of $476.4 million. Additionally, we issued $220.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes with a coupon rate of 4.75% and an initial conversion price of $36.23. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we added two new credit facilities, providing an aggregate additional $2.0 billion of credit capacity, and increased the maximum facility size of five of our existing credit facilities, providing an aggregate additional $2.3 billion of credit capacity.

(1) | These non-consolidated senior interests provide structural leverage for our net investments which are reflected in the form of mezzanine loans or other subordinate interests on our balance sheet and in our results of operations.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The amount of leverage we employ for particular assets will depend upon our Managers assessment of the credit, liquidity, price volatility, and other risks of those assets and the related financing counterparties, the availability of particular types of financing at the time, and the financial covenants under our credit facilities. Our decision to use leverage to finance our assets will be at the discretion of our Manager and will not be subject to the approval of our stockholders. We currently expect that our leverage will not exceed, on a debt to equity basis, a ratio of 4-to-1. We will endeavor to match the terms, currency, and indices of our assets and liabilities, including in certain instances through the use of derivatives. We will also seek to limit the risks associated with recourse borrowing. 
 Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, from time to time, we engage in hedging transactions that seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates or currencies on our cash flows. These hedging transactions could take a variety of forms, including interest rate or currency swaps or cap agreements, options, futures contracts, forward rate or currency agreements or similar financial instruments. 
 Floating Rate Portfolio 
 Generally, our business model is such that rising interest rates will increase our net income, while declining interest rates will decrease net income. As of December 31, 2018, 96% of our loans by total loan exposure earned a floating rate of interest and were financed with liabilities that pay interest at floating rates, which resulted in an amount of net equity that is positively correlated to rising interest rates, subject to the impact of interest rate floors on certain of our floating rate loans. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining 4% of our loans by total loan exposure earned a fixed rate of interest, but are financed with liabilities that pay interest at floating rates, which resulted in a negative correlation to rising interest rates to the extent of our financing. In certain instances where we have financed fixed rate assets with floating rate liabilities, we have purchased interest rate swaps or caps to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates on such liabilities. 
Investment Guidelines 
 Our board of directors has approved the following investment guidelines: 
 

 | our Manager shall seek to invest our capital in a broad range of investments in, or relating to, public and/or private debt, non-controlling equity, loans and/or other interests (including mezzanine interests and/or options or derivatives related thereto) relating to real estate assets (including pools thereof), real estate companies, and/or real estate-related holdings;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5 


 
 | prior to the deployment of capital into investments, our Manager may cause our capital to be invested in any short-term investments in money market funds, bank accounts, overnight repurchase agreements with primary federal reserve bank dealers collateralized by direct U.S. government obligations and other instruments or investments reasonable determined by our Manager to be of high quality;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | not more than 25% of our equity, as defined in the Management Agreement with our Manager, will be invested in any individual investment without the approval of a majority of the investment risk management committee of our board of directors (it being understood, however, that for purposes of the foregoing concentration limit, in the case of any investment that is comprised (whether through a structured investment vehicle or other arrangement) of securities, instruments or assets of multiple portfolio issuers, such investment for purposes of the foregoing limitation shall be deemed to be multiple investments in such underlying securities, instruments and assets and not such particular vehicle, product or other arrangement in which they are aggregated);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | any investment in excess of $300.0 million shall require the approval of a majority of the investment risk management committee of our board of directors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | no investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | no investment shall be made that would cause us or any of our subsidiaries to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These investment guidelines may be amended, restated, modified, supplemented or waived upon the approval of a majority of our board of directors, which must include a majority of the independent directors, without the approval of our stockholders. 
 Competition 
 We are engaged in a competitive business. In our lending and investing activities, we compete for opportunities with a variety of institutional lenders and investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds (including other funds managed by Blackstone and its affiliates), commercial and investment banks, commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. Several other REITs and other investment vehicles have raised significant amounts of capital, and may have investment objectives that overlap with ours, which may create additional competition for lending and investment opportunities. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources, such as the U.S. Government, that are not available to us. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT compliance or maintenance of an exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act. We could face increased competition from banks due to future legislative developments, such as amendments to key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including provisions setting forth capital and risk retention requirements. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of loans and investments and offer more attractive pricing or other terms than we would. Furthermore, competition for originations of and investments in assets we target may lead to decreasing yields, which may further limit our ability to generate targeted returns. 
 In the face of this competition, we have access to our Managers and Blackstones professionals and their industry expertise and relationships, which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage and help us assess risks and determine appropriate pricing for potential investments. We believe these relationships will enable us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face. For additional information concerning these competitive risks, see Item 1A Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Lending and Investment Activities.

 Employees 
 We do not have any employees. We are externally managed by our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. Our executive officers serve as officers of our Manager, and are employed by an affiliate of our Manager. 
Government Regulation 
 Our operations in North America, Europe, and Australia are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by U.S. and other governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things: (i) regulate credit-granting activities; (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; (iii) require disclosures to customers; (iv) govern secured transactions; and (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims-handling procedures and other trade practices. We are also required to comply with certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans. We intend to conduct our business so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
 In our judgment, existing statutes and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business. In recent years, legislators in the United States and in other countries have said that greater regulation of financial services firms is needed, particularly in areas such as risk management, leverage, and disclosure. While we expect that additional new regulations in these areas will be adopted and existing ones may change in the future, it is not possible at this time to forecast the exact nature of any future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon our future business, financial condition, or results of operations or prospects. 
 Taxation of the Company 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for U.S. federal income tax not to apply to our earnings that we distribute. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. 
 Our qualification as a REIT also depends on our ability to meet various other requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, which relate to organizational structure, diversity of stock ownership, and certain restrictions with regard to the nature of our assets and the sources of our income. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal income and excise taxes and state and local taxes on our income and assets. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT for any taxable year, we may be subject to material penalties as well as federal, state, and local income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and we would not be able to qualify as a REIT for the subsequent four full taxable years. 
 Furthermore, we have one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRS, which are subject to federal, state, and local income tax on their net taxable income. See Item 1ARisk FactorsRisks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items for additional tax status information. 
 Taxation of REIT Dividends 
 Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, REIT dividends (other than capital gain dividends) received by non-corporate taxpayers may be eligible for a 20% deduction. This deduction is only applicable to investors in 
 
7 


  BXMT that receive dividends and does not have any impact on us. Without further legislation, the deduction would sunset after 2025. Investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of this change on their effective tax rate with respect to REIT dividends. 
 Website Access to Reports 
 We maintain a website at www.blackstonemortgagetrust.com. We are providing the address to our website solely for the information of investors.
