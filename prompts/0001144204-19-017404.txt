Currently, the business systems of hospitals are frequently deficient and often unconnected from each other. These deficiencies in part result from the vast amount of unstructured, manually created and managed data that proliferates within the hospital’s supply chain, clinical and billing systems. SCWorx’s solutions are designed to quickly and accurately improve the flow of information between the buy-side (supply chain purchasing systems), the consumption-side (clinical documentation systems like the electronic medical records (“EMR”)) and billing and collection systems (patient billing systems). The currently poor state of interoperability limits the potential value of each independent system and requires significant expense and huge human resource commitments from senior personnel to stay ahead of problems and complete basic administrative tasks. SCWorx provides an information service that ultimately leads to safer, more cost effective and financially efficient patient care.
 
SCWorx has demonstrated that in order for the core hospital systems to function properly there must be a Single Source of Truth (“SSOT”) for all products utilized and ultimately billed for. The Item Master File (“IMF”), which is a database of all known products used in hospital and health care settings, must be accurate at all times and expanded upon to hold both clinical and financial attributes. An accurate and expanded Item Master File supports interoperability between the supply chain, clinical and financial systems by delivering, on demand, reports detailing the purchasing, utilization and revenue associated with each and every item used, allowing hospitals to better manage their business. The Single Source of Truth establishes a common vernacular and syntax, while assigning a consistent meaning across the healthcare providers core systems and accurately migrating data from one application to another and removing disconnects between critical business systems.


SCWorx’s software solutions are delivered to clients within a fixed term period, where such software is hosted in SCWorx’s data center and accessed by the client through a secure connection in a software as a service (“SaaS”) delivery method.
 
SCWorx sells its solutions and services in the United States to hospitals and health systems through its distribution and reseller partnerships.
 
SCWorx’s Software Solutions/Services
 
SCWorx empowers healthcare providers to maintain comprehensive access and visibility to an advanced business intelligence that enables better decision-making and reductions in product costs and utilization, ultimately leading to accelerated and accurate patient billing. SCWorx’s software modules perform separate functions as follows.
 

• | Virtualized Item Master File repair, expansion and automation — The process begins with data normalization — data is put into a simplified and normalized structure and location for use throughout the enterprise. The SCWorx software normalizes, automates and builds interoperability via advanced attribution, vendor and contract mapping, product categorization, repairing the unit of measure and establishing revenue codes and flags. SCWorx improves the healthcare providers’ business processes through the establishment of a clean and normalized Item Master File that improves efficiencies, eliminates cumbersome and error-prone manual processes, provides an integrated cloud-based suite of services that enhances the productivity of operating room staff, supply chain margins and billing revenue through the seamless sharing and accuracy of critical business data.

• | Electronic Medical Record Management — The Electronic Medical Record (EMR) module integrates the advanced data attributes created by SCWorx in the Item Master to the EMR. The EMR serves as the database that hospitals use to document all clinical procedures in terms of the products used and the costs that should be charged. What makes this module special is that prior to its creation there was no mechanism that tied product purchases to actual utilization. Hospitals, being mass consumption businesses, had no way to identify excess ordering that always accompanies mass consumption organizations. In addition, the automation and consistency of delivered attributes dramatically reduces the administrative burden as today these additional attributes are being created by expensive clinical resources manually — over and over again by each hospital. The SCWorx EMR management system creates one vernacular for each hospital so they see the data in a manner that suits them — and then creates a universal vernacular so they can see their performance against other like institutions.

• | Charge Description Master Management — The Charge Description Master (CDM) Management module assists healthcare providers by integrating the CDM data into the workflow of the hospitals purchasing systems so that the latest costs can be automatically updated against the hospitals charging systems. The CDM data provided SCWorx is made more accurate and the resulting data is integrated to the Item Master for real-time delivery to the EMR — this data is the last remaining piece of information that is consumed by the EMR and passed ultimately to the patient billing systems. SCWorx provides real-time integration, automation and management of Item Master File, Clinical Information Systems and the Charge Description Master. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Contract Management — SCWorx’s Contract Management Module assists healthcare providers to establish an efficient contract management system and to provide first class care to patients, while reducing operating costs, assuring adherence to compliance requirements, and mitigating risk. By linking the Item Master File to the healthcare providers contract management system and procedures, SCWorx simplifies the way contracts are managed from start to finish by streamlining the processes of creating, routing, reviewing and approving contracts. SCWorx delivers a data warehouse platform which integrates item master management, spend analysis, and contract management. These solutions enable financial staff across the healthcare provider to drill down quickly and deeply into actionable and real-time financial data and key performance indicators to improve revenue realization and staff efficiency. This suite of solutions includes the ability to automatically push price changes to a contract, compliance for standard and non-standard products, contract compliance and optimization reporting, reliable cost data for current and alternate products, cost performance metrics, matching purchase order price to contract and contract repository. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Request For Proposal (“RFP”) Automation — With the reality of shrinking operating margins, increasing operating expenses and decreasing insurance reimbursements, hospitals must evaluate all major expenditures. In addition, requirements for provable quality of service supported by trackable metrics now frequently necessitate the search for better options available in the marketplace. Since hospital-based provider subsidies are often a major expense item and since there are often perceived opportunities for quality improvement, it is a reasonable practice for hospital leadership to carefully evaluate all of their current hospital-based services and associated financial support before each contract renegotiation. The proliferation of large regional and national providers, with their ability to derive benefits from economies of scale, have made RFPs much more of a competitive process. Hospital administrators, however, often rely on poor or conflicting data when creating an RFP. Through the integration and utilization of the SSOT SCWorx automates the RFP process and makes it more accurate. SCWorx automates the core sourcing processes with the intention to accelerate cycle times, surveys and confirms business preferred processes, designs and builds a flow chart for the current and desired workflows, cross references bid analysis, implements bid scoring, customizes software to support automation and customizes the report writer and output documents.

• | Integration of Acquired Businesses — The agnostic design of the SCWorx solution enables rapid deployment of a virtual Item Master File to quickly and easily allow combining healthcare providers to share information and achieve cost synergies and interoperability without large and cumbersome upgrades or implementations. During the consolidation of healthcare providers, SCWorx cleans the data and makes the data available to the disparate systems. In addition, M&A activity requires in-depth reporting for comparison of Group Purchasing Organization (“GPO”) contract overlap. When healthcare providers that use different GPOs merge, or are acquired, there is a lack of information to compare contracts. SCWorx provides information for comparative purposes to solve these issues rapidly. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rebate Management — Frequently, vendors use rebates and incentives as a key part of their pricing strategy and structure when selling to hospitals. This tactic makes pricing more attractive to healthcare providers. When tracked through Accounts Payable, and issued correctly, rebates can help healthcare organization save money. At any large healthcare provider, vendor rebates can be difficult to manage since they require a multi-step process to track dollars earned, credits issued, and monies paid. Rebates frequently cause tracking challenges for Accounts Payable departments. Inconsistent tracking is the primary problem for loss of savings with vendor rebate programs. SCWorx’s Rebate Management Module enables healthcare providers to correctly calculate and track rebates provided by healthcare provider vendors. Purchasing or Contracting departments monitor rebates by creating and maintaining a Rebates Master List which is provided to the Accounts Payable department. To assist in this cumbersome process, SCWorx provides information from the SSOT, such as historical data, frequent updates, advanced administrative fee reporting, purchase rebate tracking, early payment/discount management and Vendor Master Data alignment.

• | Big Data Analytics Model — SCWorx provides an in-depth, easy-to-use web portal for display, reporting and analysis of the information contained within the SCWorx data warehouse. SCWorx’s analytics solution enables healthcare providers to view benchmarking information, quickly add new items to the SSOT and identify cost savings through this real-time and on-demand solution. In addition to simplifying the item add process, SCWorx provides peer comparison reporting against similar healthcare providers and a list of informative reports for business measurement, such as spend trend analysis, contract gap analysis, market price comparison, etc. The SCWorx product line is a simplified user experience and visual display for the hospital employee which does not require access to the SCWorx application.

• | Data Integration and Warehousing — Healthcare providers maintain a significant amount of data. In many cases the data is not useful for analytics since the data is held within an individual “silo.” SCWorx establishes an expandable, data warehouse of items that have been normalized, repaired and enriched as the SSOT for useful benchmarking, interoperability and analytics. SCWorx’s data warehouse allows healthcare providers to effectively use the data contained in their environment and efficiently establish the supply chain as a leading driver of revenue cycle management. The data warehouse is updated as frequently as every five minutes without intervention.

Clients and Strategic Partners
 
SCWorx continues to provide transformational data-driven solutions to some of the finest, most well-respected healthcare providers in the United States. Clients are geographically dispersed throughout the country and the continued focus is to assist healthcare providers with issues they have pertaining to data interoperability. SCWorx provides these solutions through a combination of direct sales and relationships with strategic partners.
 
Our major clients include the following hospitals and health care providers: CAPTIS, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Mercy Health, Providence Health & Services, University of Chicago Medical Center, and the University of Vermont Medical Center, among others.
 
Competition
 
SCWorx competes against a variety of vendors and smaller companies which provide solutions in the specific markets we address. Our principal competitors include:
 

• | purchasing departments that have limited budgets and may be attempting to manually repair the item master file; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | large companies with a long list of products and services and small companies which may provide item master normalization and data cleanse services; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | software companies or service providers, as well as small, specialized vendors, that provide complementary or competitive solutions in benchmarking or data analytics and data warehousing that may compete with our offerings. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some of our actual and perceived competitors have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand and business user recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios, broader distribution and presence, and competitive pricing. In addition, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive.
 
Barriers to entry to this market include technological and application sophistication, the ability to offer a proven product, creating and utilizing a well-established client base and distribution channels, brand recognition, the ability to provide agnostic interoperability and to operate on a variety of MMIS, EMR and financial platforms, the ability to integrate with pre-existing systems and capital for sustained development and marketing activities.
 
SCWorx believes that these obstacles taken together represent a moderate to high-level barrier to entry. The principal competitive factors in our markets are product features, functionality and support, product depth and breadth (number of items in the central data warehouse), flexibility, ease of deployment and use, total cost of ownership and time to value. We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of these factors. For example, besides our agnostic interoperability, additional key strengths include the SCWorx data warehouse, which exceeds 12 million items, SCWorx Big Data analytics and benchmarking.
 
Contracts, License and Service Fees
 
SCWorx enters into agreements with its clients that specify the scope of the solution to be installed and/or services to be provided by SCWorx, as well as the agreed-upon aggregate price, applicable duration and the timetable for the associated licenses and services.

For clients purchasing software to be installed locally or provided on a SaaS model, these are multi-element arrangements that include a term license granting the right to access the applicable software functionality (whether installed locally at the client site or the right to use the Company’s solutions as a part of SaaS services), terms regarding maintenance and support services, terms for any third-party components such as infrastructure and software, and professional services for implementation, integration, process engineering, optimization and training, as well as fees and payment terms for each of the foregoing. If the client purchases solutions on a long-term license model, the client may be billed the license fee up front or on a monthly or quarterly basis. Maintenance and support are provided on a term basis for separate fees, with an initial term of typically three to five years. The license, maintenance and support fee is charged annually in advance, commencing either upon contract execution or deployment of the solution in live production. If the client purchases solutions on a term-based model, the client is billed periodically a combined access fee for a specified term, typically three to five years in length.
 
SCWorx also generally provides software and SaaS clients professional services for implementation, integration, process engineering, and optimization and training. These services and the associated fees are separate from the license, maintenance and access fees. Professional services are provided on either a fixed-fee or hourly arrangements billable to clients based on agreed-to payment milestones (fixed fee) or monthly payment structure on hours incurred (hourly). These services can either be included at the time the related SaaS solution is licensed as part of the initial purchase agreement or added on afterward as an addendum to the existing agreement for services required after the initial implementation.
 
For one-time data normalization services clients, these normalization services are provided either through a stand-alone services agreement or services addendum to an existing master agreement with the client. These normalization services are available as either a one-time service or recurring monthly, quarterly or annual review structure. These services are typically provided on a per item basis. Payment typically occurs upon completion of the applicable normalization project. The commencement of revenue recognition varies depending on the size and complexity of the system and/or services involved, the implementation or performance schedule requested by the client and usage by clients of SaaS for software-based components. SCWorx’s agreements are generally non-cancelable but provide that the client may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by SCWorx and/or or may delay certain aspects of the installation or associated payments in such events. SCWorx does allow for termination for convenience in certain situations. SCWorx also includes trial or evaluation periods for certain clients, especially for new or modified solutions. Therefore, it is difficult for SCWorx to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period, and a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement, or the failure of SCWorx to procure additional agreements, could have a material adverse effect on SCWorx’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Historically, SCWorx has not experienced a material amount of contract cancellations; however, SCWorx sometimes experiences delays during contract implementation and SCWorx accounts for them accordingly.
 
Third Party License Fees
 
SCWorx incorporates software licensed from various third-party vendors into its proprietary software. Stand-alone third-party software is also required to operate certain of SCWorx’s proprietary software and/or SaaS services. SCWorx licenses these software products and pays the required license fees when such software is delivered to clients.
CageTix Ticketing Platform
 
Currently, the majority of paid tickets for regional MMA events is sold by the fighters appearing on the event fight card. Referred to as “fighter consigned” tickets, sales are generally made in face-to-face cash transactions. Our CageTix event ticketing platform allows regional promoters to control the ticketing sales chain. The CageTix platform can provide significant benefits to regional promotions, including the security of credit/debit card sales processing, immediate revenue recognition, and real time sales reporting.
Property
 
The Company does not own any real property. The principal executive offices are located at an office complex in New York, New York, consisting of shared office space that we are leasing. The lease had an original one-year term that commenced on December 1, 2015, which was renewed until November 30, 2018 and now is under a month-to-month lease agreement. The lease allows for the limited use of private offices, conference rooms, mail handling, videoconferencing, and certain other business services.
 
In conjunction with the acquisition of SCWorx Corp on February 1, 2019, the Company assumed a lease for office space in Greenwich, Connecticut. The lease expires in March 2020.
 
Government Regulation
 
The Company believes that governmental regulation is not material to its ticketing business or SCWorx’s business operations. Our MMA events were regulated at the state level by the athletic commission in each state where our promotions are conducted. The commissions are concerned primarily with the introduction and enforcement of safety rules and oversee MMA in much the same way as they do for boxing events.

Intellectual Property
 
We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements and work for hire agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our websites’ terms of use.
 
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we seek protection of our marks or our copyrighted works. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights may harm our business or our ability to compete.
 
Seasonality
 
We don’t believe that SCWorx’s revenues are impacted by seasonality.
 
Our MMA business has historically experienced a negative seasonal impact on revenues during the months of June, July and August when attendance is lower at scheduled events than during the balance of the year. As a result, we generally scheduled fewer events during this period, which resulted in less revenue during these periods compared to other periods during the year.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 2 employees. As of the closing of the acquisition on February 1, 2019, the Company had 4 employees, of whom 2 are in management and finance and 2 are in operations. We mainly utilize independent contractors for maintenance of our database and customer software installation.

In November 2016, the Company entered a sublease agreement for office and video production space in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. The lease expires on June 30, 2019. In June 2018, the Company abandoned the Cherry Hill space and in January 2019 negotiated a settlement to exit the sublease. 
 
With the acquisition of Fight Club OC, the Company assumed a lease for office space in Orange County, California. The lease expired in September 2018 and was included in the sale of Fight Club OC.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
In conducting our business, we may become involved in legal proceedings. We will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency might include, for example, estimates of potential damages, outside legal fees and other directly related costs expected to be incurred.
 
In April and May 2017, two purported securities class action complaints-Shapiro v. Alliance MMA, Inc., No. 1:17-cv-2583 (D.N.J.), and Shulman v. Alliance MMA, Inc., No. 1:17-cv-3282 (S.D.N.Y.)-were filed against the Company and certain of its officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, respectively. The complaints alleged that the defendants violated certain provisions of the federal securities laws and purported to seek damages in an amount to be alleged on behalf of a class of shareholders who purchased the Company’s common stock pursuant or traceable to the Company’s initial public offering. In July 2017, the plaintiffs in the New York action voluntarily dismissed their claim and, on March 8, 2018, the parties reached a settlement to the New Jersey action in which the insurance carrier for our directors and officers liability insurance policy has agreed to cover Alliance’s financial obligations under the settlement arrangement, less a deductible of $250,000.
 
In October 2017, a shareholder derivative claim based on the same facts that were alleged in the class action complaints was filed against the directors of the Company in the District Court for the District New Jersey; however, a complaint was not served on the defendants and, on February 2, 2018 the claim was dismissed by the District Court.
 
In June 2018, the landlord of our Cherry Hill, New Jersey office filed suit against the Company for non-payment of rent. Currently the Company is in negotiations to settle the remaining payments due under the lease. The Company recorded $167,000 of expense related to the lease within discontinued operations - general and administrative for the cost of the remaining payments under the lease agreement. This amount is accrued for at December 31, 2018 within the current liabilities - discontinued operations balance. In January 2019, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with respect to this litigation, and paid the landlord $75,000 and issued warrants to purchase 20,250 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.42 per share.
 
In June 2018, the Company’s former President, Robert Haydak, filed suit against the Company. The Company and Mr. Haydak resolved the suit effective July 2018 with the Company agreeing on a cash settlement of $50,000, and delivery of certain MMA promotion fixed assets. The Company has accrued the settlement as of December 31, 2018 which is included within net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, and current liabilities - discontinued operations balance. In February 2019, the Company paid Mr. Haydak the $50,000 called for by the settlement agreement and obtained a release of all claims thereunder.
 
On December 19, 2018, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Robert L. Mazzeo, who resigned on May 25, 2018, served a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Sothern District of NY. Mazzeo alleges that he (i) was fraudulently induced to become the CEO of the Company and (ii) entered into an employment contract with the Company and that the Company breached said alleged contract. Mazzeo seeks damages in “excess of $500,000.” The Company believes that the lawsuit is frivolous and violative of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Company filed an answer to the complaint on February 5, 2019, and, in addition to mounting a vigorous defense, the company has filed a counterclaim against Mazzeo alleging breach of fiduciary duty.
