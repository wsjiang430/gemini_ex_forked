ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

Overview
 
We are a growing chain of Innovative Medical Advancements and Care (IMAC) Regeneration Centers, combining life science advancements with traditional medical care for movement-restricting diseases and conditions. Our mix of medical and physical procedures is designed to improve patient experiences and outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs as compared to other available treatment options. We own six and manage five outpatient clinics that provide regenerative, orthopedic and minimally invasive procedures and therapies. Our treatments are performed by licensed medical practitioners through our regenerative rehabilitation protocols designed to improve the physical health, to advance the quality of life and to lessen the pain of our patients. We do not prescribe opioids, but instead offer an alternative to conventional surgery or joint replacement surgery by delivering minimally invasive medical treatments to help patients with sports injuries, back pain, knee pain, joint pain, ligament and tendon damage, and other related soft tissue conditions. Our employees focus on providing exceptional customer service to give our patients a memorable and caring experience. We believe that we have priced our treatments to be affordable by 95% of the population and are well positioned in the expanding regenerative medical sector.
 
Our licensed healthcare professionals provide each patient a custom treatment plan that integrates innovative regenerative medicine protocols (representing 31% of our revenue) with traditional, minimally invasive (minimizing incisions and skin punctures) medical procedures (representing 33% of our revenue) in combination with physical therapies (representing 31% of our revenue from physical therapy, and remaining 5% of our revenue from chiropractic). We do not use or offer opioid-based prescriptions as part of our treatment options in order to help our patients avoid the dangers of opioid abuse and addiction. We have successfully treated patients that were previously addicted to opioids because of joint or soft tissue related pain. Further, our procedures comply with all professional athletic league drug restriction policies, including the NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB.
 
Dr. Matthew Wallis, DC, our Chief Operating Officer, opened the first IMAC Regeneration Center in Paducah, Kentucky over 18 years ago in August 2000, which remains the flagship location of our current business. Dr. Jason Brame, DC joined Dr. Wallis in 2008. In 2015, Drs. Wallis and Brame hired Jeffrey S. Ervin as our Chief Executive Officer to collectively create and implement their growth strategy. The result was the formal creation of IMAC Holdings, LLC to expand IMAC clinics outside of western Kentucky, with such facilities to remain owned or operated under the group using the IMAC Regeneration Center name and services. In June 2018, we completed a corporate conversion in which IMAC Holdings, LLC was converted to IMAC Holdings, Inc. to consolidate ownership of existing clinics and implement our growth strategy.
 
Since May 2016, IMAC has opened six outpatient medical clinics and acquired four physical therapy practices for a total of 11 clinics in Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee. We intend to further expand the reach of our facilities to other strategic locations throughout the United States. In order to enhance our brand, we have partnered with several active and former professional athletes, opening two Ozzie Smith IMAC Regeneration Centers, two David Price IMAC Regeneration Centers, and one Tony Delk IMAC Regeneration Center. We have also signed former NBA player George Gervin to be a brand ambassador for future clinics in Texas. Our brand ambassadors help deliver awareness to our non-opioid services, emphasizing our ability to treat sports and orthopedic injuries as an alternative to traditional surgeries for joint repair or replacement.
 
We are focused on providing natural, non-opioid solutions to pain as consumers increasingly demand conservative treatments for an aging population. The demand for our services continues to grow fueled by consumer preferences for organic healthcare solutions over traditionally invasive orthopedic practices. We believe that our regenerative rehabilitation treatments are provided to patients at a much lower price than our primary competitors, including orthopedic surgeons, pain management clinics and hospital systems targeting invasive joint reconstruction. Surgical joint replacements cost several times more than our therapies initially treating the same condition. The U.S. government has recently adopted strict surgery pre-approval initiatives to reduce the cost for CMS and limit the proliferation of opioids since they accompany substantially all joint replacement surgeries.

We believe patient satisfaction will be driven by our following five fundamental beliefs:
 

● | We believe that the body has the ability to heal itself, and better results occur with our solutions to unlock the body’s natural healing process; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We believe in the power of doctors, from many different specializations, working together for the best patient care possible; 
● | We believe that employees should know patients by their face, not by a chart number; 
● | We believe consumers have a choice regardless of physician referral or insurance coverage; and 
● | We believe a medical setting should be comforting. 

 
We are led by senior executive officers who together have more than 70 years of combined experience in the healthcare services industry. Jeffrey S. Ervin, our Chief Executive Officer, joined us in March 2015. Mr. Ervin has a history of sourcing private equity investments and managing private equity operations in the healthcare and other growth industries. Before joining us, he was the senior financial officer at Medx Publishing, LLC, an online healthcare marketing and technology firm and parent company of Medicare.com, where he was responsible for the successful sale and disposition of Medicare.com to eHealth Insurance and sale of Medicaid.com to United Healthcare. Mr. Ervin earned an M.B.A. degree from Vanderbilt University. The founder of our company, Matthew C. Wallis, DC, a former licensed chiropractor, is our Chief Operating Officer. Dr. Wallis has implemented strategies in the company to create consistent operating efficiencies for our sales, marketing and service delivery operations. D. Anthony Bond, CPA joined us as our Chief Financial Officer in October 2017. Mr. Bond has a long history in senior financial roles with healthcare organizations managing multi-state operations. Ian A. White, Ph.D. joined us as our Chief Scientific Officer in August 2018. He is the President of BioFirma, LLC, a stem cell regenerative medicine research firm, and Chairman of the Scientific Committee for the American Association of Stem Cell Physicians. Dr. White received his Ph.D. in Physiology, Biophysics and Systems Biology from Cornell University at its Ansary Stem Cell Institute.
 
Our Market Opportunity
 
Orbis Research reported that the regenerative healthcare industry in the United States is estimated to be $67.6 billion by 2019, and IBIS World estimated that outpatient rehabilitation in the U.S. is an approximately $30 billion industry, with approximately 90% of that revenue generated from physical rehabilitation services, including orthopedic, sports, geriatric and other forms of physical medicine. Outpatient rehabilitation is anticipated to grow at a rate of 2% to 7% in the coming years, according to these industry research companies, due to the aging baby boomer generation, sustained high rates of obesity and healthcare reform. As healthcare insurance providers seek to reduce medical costs and government regulation restricts access to opioid pain prescriptions, physical therapy and outpatient services are poised to capture a larger share of healthcare spending. As the workforce continues to grow, employer-based insurance expenditures will increase. In addition, government spending on Medicare will continue to be significant.
Outpatient Rehabilitation Spending by Segment

-

 

According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ National Health Expenditure Projections 2017-2026, national healthcare expenditures continue to rise and are projected to grow from an estimated $3.5 trillion in 2017 to $5.7 trillion by 2026, representing an average annual rate of growth of 5.5%, reaching a projected 19.7% of U.S. gross domestic product in 2026, as shown below.
 

Demand for minimally invasive movement corrections and non-opioid pain management has surged with the growth of the baby boomer generation. The U.S. Census estimates that the U.S. population over 65 years of age is projected to more than double from 47.8 million to nearly 98.2 million persons and the 85 and older population is expected to more than triple, from 6.3 million to 19.7 million persons, between 2015 and 2060. Additionally, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of older Americans is increasing as a percentage of the total U.S. population with the number of persons older than 65 estimated to comprise 14.9% of the total U.S. population in 2015 and projected to grow to 23.6% by 2060.

This significant demographic shift is changing healthcare consumption patterns. At the same time, individuals who are not eligible for Medicare have faced a significant rise in health insurance premiums. As consumers assume the burden of greater healthcare costs, they are price shopping and considering second opinions from conservative treatment providers like our company.
 
Despite ongoing consolidation in the outpatient rehabilitation services industry, the industry remains highly fragmented, which has allowed many competitors to enter the market. In such an environment, reputable and successful outpatient clinics will be able to grow through organic expansion and combining services with other providers. While there is significant competition in the industry, we believe no single participant currently captures more than 10% of the market, which may allow existing market participants to distinguish themselves from their competitors as they grow. The attractiveness of outpatient facilities to reduce medical costs has also been seen in other medical areas. Insurer UnitedHealth Group recently purchased surgical care centers and medical practices, with an apparent aim to reduce hospital spending.
 
Our Operations
 
We currently operate 11 outpatient medical clinics in three states. Our original clinic opened in August 2000 and remains the flagship location of our current business, which was formally organized in March 2015 with the mission of expanding the reach of our facilities to other strategic locations throughout the United States. Our flagship medical clinic has been operated during the last 18 years by Matthew C. Wallis, DC and Jason Brame, DC, two of our co-founders, and, since March 2015, together with Jeffrey S. Ervin, our third co-founder and the current Chief Executive Officer of our company. This management team continues today throughout the organization incorporating the same strategies used to build and operate the company’s flagship location. During 2016 and 2017, we opened five medical clinics and expanded into two new states, Missouri and Tennessee. In 2018, we opened one medical clinic and acquired four physical therapy clinics.

We opened a 4,700 square foot facility in Murray, Kentucky, a town of nearly 15,000 residents near the Tennessee border. This facility provides medical evaluations, fluoroscopic joint and appendage injections, and physical medicine and refers patients to Paducah for regenerative PRP medical procedures. The lease is scheduled to expire in December 2023.
 
IMAC of St. Louis, LLC. In January 2016, IMAC of St. Louis, LLC, doing business as the Ozzie Smith Center, executed a lease for a 13,300 square foot facility in Chesterfield, Missouri, a suburb 18 miles west of downtown St. Louis. The Ozzie Smith Center opened in May 2016. The lease agreement runs until August 2026. Dr. Devin Bell, D.O. is the medical director. The clinic performs medical evaluations with x-ray, fluoroscopic spine, joint and appendage injections, regenerative PRP medicine and physical medicine. Namesake Ozzie Smith was inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame in 2002 and replicas of his 13 gold glove trophies are in the lobby of the clinic.
 
The Ozzie Smith Center opened a satellite facility in St. Peters, Missouri to assist with demand from suburbs west of the Missouri River. The St. Peters clinic opened for business in July 2017. The lease expires in August 2022. The facility operates under the direction of Dr. Bell and offers patient medical evaluations with x-ray, fluoroscopic joint and appendage injections, and physical medicine.
 
IMAC Regeneration Center of Nashville, PC. The David Price Center opened in Brentwood, Tennessee in May 2017. Dr. David Smithson, M.D. is double board certified in Sports Medicine and Internal Medicine and serves as its medical director. The 7,500 square foot clinic is leased through July 2024. The clinic performs medical evaluations with x-ray, fluoroscopic spine, joint and appendage injections, regenerative PRP medicine and physical medicine.
 
In November 2017, we opened a 5,500 square foot facility in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, a southeastern suburb of Nashville with more than 100,000 residents and hometown to David Price. Mr. Price, who was born and raised in middle Tennessee, was the first pick of the 2007 Major League draft from Vanderbilt University. This facility performs patient medical evaluations with x-ray, fluoroscopic joint and appendage injections, and physical medicine. We occupy 10% of the building and the lease expires in October 2022.
 
Tony Delk Center. In March 2018, we entered into a $1.2 million commitment to purchase a medical practice building in Lexington, Kentucky, where our seventh IMAC outpatient medical clinic, named the Tony Delk Center, opened on July 2, 2018.
 
Advantage Therapy. In August 2018, we acquired the physical and occupational therapy provider, Advantage Therapy, which operates four locations in the Springfield, Missouri metropolitan area. The South Springfield location occupies 5,000 square feet and expires in June 2019. The North Springfield, Monett and Ozark locations function as satellite locations. The north location functions within 2,400 square feet with an expiration date of May 2020. The Monett location occupies 2,200 square feet pursuant to a lease that expires in February 2021, while the Ozark location operates in approximately 1,000 square feet pursuant to a lease that expires upon 30 days’ notice. Advantage Therapy is an established business with more than ten years of operations in the Springfield, Missouri market. We believe there is potential to grow the existing practice that provides over 1,000 therapy visits each month with the addition of medical services to offer our comprehensive IMAC service line.
 
Our Services
 
The licensed healthcare professionals at our clinics work with each patient to create a protocol customized for each patient by utilizing a combination of the following traditional and innovative treatments:
 
Medical Treatments. Our specialized team of doctors work together to provide the latest minimally invasive, prescription-free treatments for movement challenges or pain related to orthopedic conditions. The treatments are customized to treat the underlying condition instead of addressing the challenge with prescriptions or surgeries.
 
Regenerative Medicine. Regenerative therapy at IMAC Regeneration Centers utilizes undifferentiated cellular tissue to regenerate damaged tissue. The majority of our procedures utilize cells from the patient, harvested under minimal manipulation, and applied during the same visit to the clinic. These autologous cells help to heal degenerative soft tissue conditions, which cause pain or compromise the patient’s quality of life. Independent studies in this area, including a recent safety and feasibility study published by Dr. Peter B. Fodor, “Adipose Derived Stromal Cell Injections for Pain Management of Osteoarthritis in the Human Knee Joint” (Aesthetic Surgery Journal, February 2016), have supported claims that autologous cell treatments using stromal vascular fraction (adipose) and bone marrow lead to improved function and decreased pain within joints, muscles and connective tissue and can help alleviate osteoarthritis and degenerative disease. We believe that we have generally followed the increasingly accepted protocols described in these studies in connection with our regenerative therapies.
 
Physical Medicine. Our team of sports medicine practitioners start by collaboratively building a personalized physical medicine treatment plan designed to help patients get back to living the life they deserve.
 
Physical Therapy. With a combination of biomechanical loading and tissue mobilization, our licensed physical rehabilitation therapists work with each patient to help the body restore skill within the joint or soft tissue.
 
Spinal Decompression. During this treatment, the spine is stretched and relaxed intermittently in a controlled manner, creating a negative pressure in the disc area that can pull herniated or bulging tissue back into the disc. Whether caused by trauma or degeneration, we realize the impact a spinal injury can have on the quality of one’s life and are committed to providing the most innovative, minimally invasive medical technology and care to relieve back pain and restore function.

Chiropractic Manipulation. Common for spine conditions, manual manipulation is used to increase range of motion, reduce nerve irritability and improve function.
 
In November 2017, we engaged a medical consulting group to advise us on current regenerative medicine therapy protocols and to organize a clinical trial towards an investigational new drug application (IND) with the FDA, while pursuing a voluntary Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation. This process is defined under Section 3033 of the 21st Century Cures Act. We intend to pursue a trial utilizing autologous cellular structures to alleviate symptoms of debilitating neurological conditions and diseases.
 
The medical consulting group has assisted us in conducting research, establishing patient engagement tools and developing clinical strategies to achieve the RMAT. We have not yet engaged with the FDA and we anticipate our first communication with the FDA to occur during the second or third quarter of 2019 as an INTERACT (Initial Targeted Engagement for Regulatory Advice on CBER products) meeting. Following the INTERACT meeting, an amount of work (which cannot be quantified as of yet) will be performed to prepare for a pre-Investigational New Drug meeting and gain more precise feedback from the FDA before completing an IND submission. Another round of work will be performed to complete the IND application. Finally, the FDA Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies will notify us of the IND application result no later than 60 days after receipt of the IND submission and RMAT request.
 
No assurance can be given that the FDA will find that our trial meets the criteria for RMAT designation. We believe that a RMAT designation may be helpful in differentiating our services and gaining a collaborative connection with the FDA. The failure to earn the RMAT designation will result in unfulfilled research expenses but should not negatively affect our operations. We expect the cost to pursue the RMAT designation will be between $100,000 and $300,000 and take 18 to 30 months of time from the original engagement with our medical consultant.
 
Our Growth and Expansion Strategy
 
We have developed a comprehensive approach and well-defined model for new clinic openings ranging from site selection to staffing. Our original clinic in Paducah, Kentucky, which opened in August 2000, has shown consistent growth in patient visits, and is profitable. We will continue to apply this extensive experience and knowledge to new clinic openings as well as acquisitions. Our six recently opened clinics, combined with our August 2018 acquisition of four physical therapy clinics, are expected to provide us with significant revenue growth as these sites mature. In 2018, we also made investments in our corporate infrastructure and life science product development, which we believe will position us well to support our planned expansion.
 
We have plans to open additional IMAC Regeneration Centers in the states in which we currently operate, as well as in other strategic locations throughout the United States, building on our familiarity with the demographic market and our reputation in the area to attract new patients and endorsements. Our strategic partnerships with regional and national sports celebrities have enabled us to increase our visibility in our markets and become known for providing innovative regenerative-based therapies. We continue to seek opportunities to work with more athletes to draw awareness to our services. In addition, we have enlisted a wide range of medical and alternative medicine professionals to continue providing innovative outpatient treatments to our patients without major surgery or prescription pain medication.
 
The key elements of our strategy that we believe will continue to propel our growth and expansion are:
 
Open New Outpatient Locations and Facilities. We are in the process of identifying strategic new locations at which to lease and develop new IMAC Regeneration Centers. We anticipate initial expansion in the Midwest and southern United States, including in Illinois, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas within the next 12 months. By branching into states adjacent to existing centers, we will expand our regional market familiarity, with our outpatient clinics and focus our marketing efforts. We believe our strong regional operations will provide brand awareness and allow us to leverage our established administrative infrastructure and will provide a foundation to support our expansion.
 
Expand Our Service Offerings to Employers and Self-Insured Health Plans. We have received inquiries from employers researching conservative treatment options for their employees. The inquiries primarily focus on minimizing employee time away from work related to injuries or occupational hazards and the cost of aggressive orthopedic treatments and threat of opioid abuse for employees enrolled in an employer health plan. We intend to create simple conservative treatment protocols for employers seeking to reduce employee downtime, prescription narcotic usage and surgical expenditures within their health plan.
 
Continue to Obtain Endorsements from Well-Known Sports Celebrities. We continue to attract celebrity sports endorsers for each market in which we operate and plan to expand. By collaborating and co-branding with well-known sports figures, patients become more familiar with our brand and associate our company with physical fitness and well-being. Working with sports celebrities that are well-known in our markets and personally recommend our treatments helps establish credibility with patients in those markets.
 
Accelerate Research and Development of New Regenerative Products. Our recent investment in BioFirma LLC was executed in order to research and develop regenerative medicine products and supplies. We intend to fund this research with the goal of identifying innovative treatments to deliver within IMAC Regeneration Centers, as well as producing approved products for distribution into the broader medical community.

Expand Our Advertising and Marketing. We intend to increase our advertising and marketing efforts and reach throughout our primary service areas in order to grow patient volume at our existing facilities and spur interest in newer locations. Our current marketing efforts include a combination of local television, internet and event advertising. We will introduce employer marketing initiatives with help from our celebrity endorsers. While we welcome patients that are referred to us by other healthcare providers, we believe that direct marketing will generate more new patients for our outpatient clinics than relying solely on antiquated medical referral practices.
 
Offer State-of-the-Art Orthopedic Treatments. Our regenerative medicine techniques are used to prevent arthritis, treat meniscus tears, defeat muscle deterioration and address other damaged tissue conditions. We will continue offering innovative therapies and recently approved medical technologies, including alternative medicine treatments, and will adapt our treatment offerings as new treatments are developed and come to market. By bringing together a diverse array of medical specialists, we are able to treat more health conditions and attract a larger base of patients.
 
Advertising and Marketing
 
Our corporate advertising and marketing efforts focus on increasing our brand awareness and communicating our commitment to “success without major surgery,” along with the many other competitive advantages our company offers. Our marketing strategy is to offer an innovative and recently approved medical technologies for movement and orthopedic therapies that appeal to a wide range of potential patients, continually elevate awareness of our brand and generate demand for our outpatient medical services. We rely on a number of channels in this area, including digital advertising, email marketing, social media and affiliate marketing, as well as through strategic partnerships with well-known sports celebrities to build our endorsements and draw patients to our IMAC Regeneration Centers. Our celebrity endorsers appear in our press marketing and social media marketing efforts and help generate interest in our brand and services. We maintain our website at www.imacregeneration.com. We intend to hire additional sales and marketing personnel and increase our spending on sales, marketing and promotion in connection with the continued expansion of our outpatient locations. Advertising and marketing expense was $859,191 and $119,867 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on active individuals who seek to maintain, restore and maximize their health and wellness. A majority of our customers are located within 25 miles of one of our outpatient medical clinics. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue, respectively.
 
Competition and Our Competitive Advantages
 
The outpatient physical therapy industry is highly competitive, with thousands of clinics across the country. While some of our competitors offer regenerative medical treatments as an effective treatment for degenerative health conditions, we believe that few companies have the multi-disciplinary approach of combining physical therapy and medical professionals working together to generate optimal regenerative health outcomes. Our internal survey results conducted randomly with more than 120 patients during 2016 and 2017 reported that 91% of our patients experienced improvement in their health after treatments at our outpatient clinics. One of our major competitive advantages is the offering of more broadly affordable regenerative treatments.
 
Competitive factors affecting our business include quality of care, cost, treatment outcomes, convenience of location, and relationships with, and ability to meet the needs of, referral and insurance payor sources. Our clinics compete, directly or indirectly, with many types of healthcare providers including the physical therapy departments of hospitals, private therapy clinics, physician-owned therapy clinics, and chiropractors. We may face more intense competition if consolidation of the therapy industry continues.
 
We believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competition and have been able to grow our business as a result of the following competitive strengths:
 
Our Minimally Invasive Approach to Traditional Orthopedic Care. We pay particular attention to rehabilitating our patients’ musculoskeletal system to reduce pain and enhance mobility without major surgery or anesthesia. By combining physical therapy and regenerative medicine, we are able to treat a variety of physical conditions by using a patient’s own body to help heal itself.
 
Strong Regional Presence. We own six and manage five clinics in three states, providing us significant leverage for implementation of our marketing strategies and utilization of our staff. We believe we offer a broader platform of regenerative therapies than our regional competitors.
 
We Do Not Prescribe Addictive Opioids. We do not use or offer opioid-based prescriptions as part of our treatment options in order to help our patients avoid the dangers of opioid abuse and addiction. We focus on preventing the potential for addiction through our regenerative-based therapies that help alleviate chronic pain.
 
We Employ a Regenerative Medicine Scientist. Few medical provides employ scientists. Our regenerative medicine scientist works at our BioFirma office in Miami, Florida and provides direction to our medical professionals as to the availability of regenerative medicine advancements in the marketplace. Collaborative work among our medical professionals and our regenerative medicine scientist through regular meetings, in person visits and telephonic communication yields broad discussions on the potential to develop proprietary techniques or services using such advancements.
 
Utilizing Diverse Medical Specialists for Customized Care. Our treatment protocols are customized by a team of medical doctors, nurse practitioners, chiropractors and physical therapists and are designed to heal damaged tissue without major surgery or prescription pain medication. This team approach delivers comprehensive service while avoiding the higher costs of major reconstructive surgery by medical specialists.

Protection of Proprietary Information
 
We own various U.S. federal trademark registrations and applications, and unregistered trademarks, including the registered mark “IMAC Regeneration Center.” We rely on trademark laws in the United States, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary information and brand. We cannot assure you that existing trademark laws or contractual rights will be adequate for protecting our intellectual property and proprietary information. Protection of confidential information, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights in the markets in which we operate and compete is highly uncertain and may involve complex legal questions. We cannot completely prevent the unauthorized use or infringement of our confidential information or intellectual property rights as such prevention is inherently difficult. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our confidential information and intellectual property protection.
 
BioFirma, LLC, our 70%-owned subsidiary, has applied for a trademark on the product name NeoCyte. BioFirma has determined not to pursue a patent on this product at its current stage of development, nor considers the success of its future product development to be dependent on obtaining a patent.
 
We are not aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our rights in our trademarks. We do not expect to need any additional intellectual property rights to carry out our growth and expansion strategy.
 
For years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not incur any material time or labor for the development of the technology we use in our operations.
 
Government Regulation
 
Numerous federal, state and local regulations regulate healthcare services and those who provide them. Some states into which we may expand have laws requiring facilities employing health professionals and providing health-related services to be licensed and, in some cases, to obtain a certificate of need (that is, demonstrating to a state regulatory authority the need for, and financial feasibility of, new facilities or the commencement of new healthcare services). None of the states in which we currently operate require a certificate of need for the operation of our physical therapy business functions. Our healthcare professionals and/or medical clinics, however, are required to be licensed, as determined by the state in which they provide services. Failure to obtain or maintain any required certificates, approvals or licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Regulations Controlling Fraud and Abuse. Various federal and state laws regulate financial relationships involving providers of healthcare services. These laws include Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S. C. § 1320a-7b(b)) (the “Fraud and Abuse Law”), under which civil and criminal penalties can be imposed upon persons who, among other things, offer, solicit, pay or receive remuneration in return for (i) the referral of patients for the rendering of any item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by a Federal health care program (including Medicare and Medicaid); or (ii) purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, ordering any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by a Federal health care program (including Medicare and Medicaid). We believe that our business procedures and business arrangements are in compliance with these provisions. However, the provisions are broadly written and the full extent of their specific application to specific facts and arrangements to which we are a party is uncertain and difficult to predict. In addition, several states have enacted state laws similar to the Fraud and Abuse Law, which may be more restrictive than the federal Fraud and Abuse Law.
 
Stark Law. Provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. §1395nn) (the “Stark Law”) prohibit referrals by a physician of “designated health services” which are payable, in whole or in part, by Medicare or Medicaid, to an entity in which the physician or the physician’s immediate family member has an investment interest or other financial relationship, subject to several exceptions. Unlike the Fraud and Abuse Law, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute. Proof of intent to violate the Stark Law is not required. Physical therapy services are among the “designated health services.” Further, the Stark Law has application to our management contracts with individual physicians and physician groups, as well as, any other financial relationship between us and referring physicians, including medical advisor arrangements and any financial transaction resulting from a clinic acquisition. The Stark Law also prohibits billing for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. Several states have enacted laws similar to the Stark Law. These state laws may cover all (not just Medicare and Medicaid) patients. As with the Fraud and Abuse Law, we consider the Stark Law in planning our outpatient clinics, establishing contractual and other arrangements with physicians, marketing and other activities, and believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the Stark Law. If we violate the Stark Law or any similar state laws, our financial results and operations could be adversely affected. Penalties for violations include denial of payment for the services, significant civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 
HIPAA. In an effort to further combat healthcare fraud and protect patient confidentially, Congress included several anti-fraud measures in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). HIPAA created a source of funding for fraud control to coordinate federal, state and local healthcare law enforcement programs, conduct investigations, provide guidance to the healthcare industry concerning fraudulent healthcare practices, and establish a national data bank to receive and report final adverse actions. HIPAA also criminalized certain forms of health fraud against all public and private payers. Additionally, HIPAA mandates the adoption of standards regarding the exchange of healthcare information in an effort to ensure the privacy and electronic security of patient information and standards relating to the privacy of health information. Sanctions for failing to comply with HIPAA include criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In February of 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) was signed into law. Title XIII of ARRA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), provided for substantial Medicare and Medicaid incentives for providers to adopt electronic health records (“EHRs”) and grants for the development of health information exchange (“HIE”). Recognizing that HIE and EHR systems will not be implemented unless the public can be assured that the privacy and security of patient information in such systems is protected, HITECH also significantly expanded the scope of the privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Most notable are the mandatory breach notification requirements and a heightened enforcement scheme that includes increased penalties, and which now apply to business associates as well as to covered entities. In addition to HIPAA, a number of states have adopted laws and/or regulations applicable in the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information that can be more stringent than comparable provisions under HIPAA.

We believe that our operations comply with applicable standards for privacy and security of protected healthcare information. We cannot predict what negative effect, if any, HIPAA/HITECH or any applicable state law or regulation will have on our business.
 
Cybersecurity. We are a medical provider and comply with HIPAA and data sensitivity requirements as regulated by local and federal authorities. Our patient data is hosted, managed and secured with an approved Electronic Medical Record vendor. Cybersecurity is of paramount importance and our executive officers have implemented routine cyber breach insurance policies to protect our company from potential predatory initiatives to access patient and company data. See “Risk Factors – Our reputation and relationships with patients would be harmed if our patients’ data, particularly personally identifying data, were to be subject to a cyber-attack or otherwise by unauthorized persons.”
 
FDA Drug Approval Process
 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDAs”), warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. As a result of these regulations, pharmaceutical product development and approval are very expensive and time consuming.
 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. For dermatology products, Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine metabolism, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials with statistically significant results to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of an effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 
After completion of the required activities, including clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States.
 
The FDA also may refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with the FDA’s good clinical practice requirements. Additionally, the FDA typically inspects the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured, and may inspect the sponsor company and investigator sites that participated in the clinical trials. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective for the stated indication.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction following FDA review of a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”), to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA generally uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 
Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA filed under section 505(b)(1) of the FDC Act. An alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA (“505(b)(2) NDA”), which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application.
 
505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant.
 
Biologics
 
Biological products used for the prevention, treatment or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), via a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs and BLA supplements, including review timelines, are very similar to those for NDAs and NDA supplements, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as other drugs.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 
Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data.
 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity, patent or non-patent, for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of our programs.
Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies (RMAT) Designation
 
The FDA has established a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act. The RMAT designation program is intended to fulfill the Cures Act requirement that the FDA facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug that meets the following criteria: (1) it qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Like breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. RMAT-designated products that receive accelerated approval may, as appropriate, fulfill their post-approval requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence (such as electronic health records); through the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or via post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to approval of the therapy.
 
Other Regulatory Factors. Political, economic and regulatory influences are fundamentally changing the healthcare industry in the United States. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems. Potential alternative approaches could include mandated basic healthcare benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, and price controls. Legislative debate is expected to continue in the future and market forces are expected to demand only modest increases or reduced costs. For instance, managed care entities are demanding lower reimbursement rates from healthcare providers and, in some cases, are requiring or encouraging providers to accept capitated payments that may not allow providers to cover their full costs or realize traditional levels of profitability. We cannot reasonably predict what impact the adoption of federal or state healthcare reform measures or future private sector reform may have on our business.
 
In recent years, federal and state governments have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering behavior that violates the federal civil and criminal laws regarding false claims and fraudulent billing and coding practices. Such laws require providers to adhere to complex reimbursement requirements regarding proper billing and coding in order to be compensated for their services by government payers. Our compliance program requires adherence to applicable law and promotes reimbursement education and training; however, a determination that our clinics’ billing and coding practices are false or fraudulent could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
As a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental inspections, reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. Managed care payers may also reserve the right to conduct audits. An adverse inspection, review, audit or investigation could result in refunding amounts we have been paid; fines penalties and/or revocation of billing privileges for the affected clinics; exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or one or more managed care payer network; or damage to our reputation.
 
We and our outpatient medical clinics are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting entities and individuals from knowingly and willfully making claims to Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs and third-party payers that contain false or fraudulent information. The federal False Claims Act encourages private individuals to file suits on behalf of the government against healthcare providers such as us. As such suits are generally filed under seal with a court to allow the government adequate time to investigate and determine whether it will intervene in the action, the implicated healthcare providers often are unaware of the suit until the government has made its determination and the seal is lifted. Violations or alleged violations of such laws, and any related lawsuits, could result in (i) exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, or (ii) significant financial or criminal sanctions, resulting in the possibility of substantial financial penalties for small billing errors that are replicated in a large number of claims, as each individual claim could be deemed a separate violation. In addition, many states also have enacted similar statutes, which may include criminal penalties, substantial fines, and treble damages.
 
Employees
 
As of April 16, 2019, we employed 124 individuals, of which 105 were full-time employees. As of that date, none of our employees were governed by collective bargaining agreements or were members of a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be very good.

11

In the states in which our current outpatient clinics are located, persons performing designated medical or physical therapy services are required to be licensed by the state. Based on standard employee screening systems in place, all persons currently employed by us who are required to be licensed are licensed. We are not aware of any federal licensing requirements applicable to our employees.
 
Medical and Scientific Advisory Board
 
We intend to establish a Medical and Scientific Advisory Board under the direction of our Chief Scientific Officer comprised of physicians, other healthcare professionals, scientific researchers and university professors with experience in the areas of regenerative medicine. The Advisory Board is expected to meet periodically with our Board of Directors and management to discuss matters relating to our orthopedic therapies, range of medical treatments and strategic direction. Members of the Advisory board will be reimbursed by us for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in serving on the Advisory Board. We do not expect any Advisory Board members will have a conflict of interest between their obligation to us and their obligations to other companies or organizations.

2018 Private Placement
 
In the first six months of 2018, we received gross proceeds of $1,530,000 from a private placement of our 4% convertible promissory notes. The $1,530,000 and an additional $200,000 in existing equity and payments to investors (plus accrued interest) is convertible into 445,559 shares of our common stock, pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement with 23 accredited investors. The principal amount of the promissory notes was convertible into shares of common stock automatically upon the closing our initial public offering, which was completed in February 2019. The conversion price of the promissory notes was an amount reflecting a 20% discount to the initial public offering price of $5.00 per share.
 
On June 1, 2018, we entered into a note payable to the Edward S. Bredniak Revocable Trust in the amount of up to $2,000,000. An existing note payable with this entity with an outstanding balance of $379,675.60 was combined into the new note payable. The note carries an interest rate of 10% per annum and all outstanding balances are due and payable 13 months after the closing our initial public offering, which was completed in February 2019. The proceeds of this note are being used to satisfy ongoing working capital needs, expenses related to the preparation for our initial public offering, equipment and construction costs related to new clinic locations and potential business combination and transaction expenses.
 
Initial Public Offering
 
The registration statement for our initial public offering (File No. 333-227385) was declared effective on February 12, 2019. On February 15, 2019, we completed our initial public offering of 850,000 units, with each unit consisting one share of our common stock and two warrants each to purchase one share of our common stock, at a combined initial public offering price of $5.125 per unit. The exercise price of the warrants is $5.00 per warrant. The units immediately and automatically separated upon issuance, and the common stock and warrants trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbols “IMAC” and “IMACW,” respectively.
 
We received aggregate gross proceeds of $4,356,250 from our initial public offering, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other related expenses. Proceeds from the offering are being used for financing the costs of leasing, developing and acquiring new clinic locations, funding research and new product development activities, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.
 
In addition, upon the closing of our initial public offering, we issued unit purchase options to Dawson James Securities, Inc., as representative of the several underwriters, and its affiliates entitling them to purchase a number of our securities equal to 4% of the securities sold in the initial public offering. The unit purchase options have an exercise price equal to 120% of the public offering price of the units (or $6.15 per share and two warrants) and may be exercised on a cashless basis. The unit purchase options are not redeemable by us.
 
Corporate Information and Incorporation
 
The first IMAC Regeneration Center was organized in August 2000 as a Kentucky professional service corporation. That center was the forerunner to our current business and remains our flagship location. Matthew C. Wallis, DC and Jason Brame, DC, together with Jeffrey S. Ervin, became the founding members of IMAC Holdings, LLC, a Kentucky limited liability company organized in March 2015, to expand our management team to support our clinical expansion while meeting the requirements of state healthcare practice guidelines and ownership laws.
 
The following chart reflects the corporate structure of our key operating units:
