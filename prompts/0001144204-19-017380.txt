Historical background 
 
Target Group Inc. (formerly known as Chess Supersite Corporation) (“Target Group” or “the Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 2, 2013, under our original name of River Run Acquisition Corporation. On May 5, 2014, we issued 500,000 shares of common stock to Rubin Schindermann and 500,000 shares of Common Stock to Alexander Starr. With the issuance of these shares and the redemption of 19,500,000 shares of common stock issued to our original officers, directors and shareholders, we effected a change of control. Mr. Schindermann and Mr. Starr became our new officers and directors. They accepted the resignations of our original founding officers and directors. Effective May 13, 2014, the Company changed its name to Chess Supersite Corporation.
 
On July 23, 2014, we acquired certain assets (“Acquisition”) of Chess Supersite, Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of Ontario, Canada (“Chess Canada”). The Acquisition was consummated pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock to Chess Canada.

Cannabis Business-Canada
 
We are now engaged in the cultivation, processing and distribution of curated cannabis products for the adult-use medical and recreational cannabis market in Canada and, where legalized by state legislation, in the United States. We believe that there is a shift in the public’s perception of cannabis from a state of prohibition to a state of legalization. In October 2018, Canada became the first major industrialized nation to legalize adult-use cannabis at the national federal level. Cannabis is still heavily regulated. However, the medical use of cannabis is now permitted in up to 29 countries and many more countries have reformed, or are considering reforming, their cannabis uses laws to include the recreational use of cannabis.
 
In the 2016 publication by Deloitte, Insights and Opportunities Recreational Marijuana, the project size of the Canadian adult-use market ranged from CDN$4.9 billion to CDN$8.7 billion annually. Ion the 2018 publication by Deloitte, A Society in Transition, an Industry Ready to Boom, the projected size of the Canadian adult-use market in 2019 ranged from CDN$1.8 billion to CDN$4.3 billion. The Canadian medical cannabis industry experienced substantial growth since 2014. Health Canada projects the Canadian cannabis market will reach CDN$1.3 billion in annual value by 2024.
