Products and Markets
 
Microsource
 
Microsource’s primary business is the design of custom Microwave Integrated Components as well as the production of MIC components using chip and wire assembly methods. Microsource offers a line of tunable, synthesized Band Reject Filters (“BRF”) for solving interference problems in RADAR/EW applications. Self-protection systems onboard high performance military aircraft often require RADAR filters to block electromagnetic interference generated by other onboard electronic systems, particularly the aircraft’s main RADAR. Our high-speed, tunable notch filters can quickly block interference from both continuous wave and wide bandwidth emissions. Using proprietary driver and phase lock technology, these filters offer tuning speeds that are up to ten times faster than traditional filter designs. We design these filters specifically for each application.
 
While our RADAR filter technology may be used in a variety of operational applications and as components in microwave instruments and devices, Microsource’s two largest customers are prime contractors for whom we develop and manufacture RADAR filters used in fighter aircrafts. Microsource serves the aftermarket for operational hardware associated with the United States Government’s RADAR Modernization Program for prior generation fighter aircraft (i.e., the F/A-18E, F-15D and F-16 jets) to extend their useful lives. These RADAR filters are designed to withstand the rigors of operating under extreme conditions. They must be able to operate while exposed to the shock, vibration, high altitudes and temperature extremes experienced during jet flight without any cooling or heating from the aircraft.
 
Our customers require that Microsource be certified to the stringent AS9100D aerospace quality standard. Microsource routinely maintains a top rating from its customers and over the years has received a “Supplier of the Year” award, as well as multiple “Gold Supplier” awards from one of our prime customers. We received our most recent customer award in April of 2019 for delivering consistent product quality and on-time shipments during 2018.
 
Microsource’s revenues have grown as prime contractors began upgrading additional aircraft. Initially Microsource supplied filters for one fighter jet, the F/A-18E. During our 2014 fiscal year, the prime contractor added a second aircraft, the F-15. Additionally, during our 2017 fiscal year, a second prime contractor added a third aircraft, the F-16. As a result, Microsource’s revenue has climbed to over $9 million in fiscal 2019, which ended March 30, 2019. Microsource is a sole-source supplier of filters for these three fighter jets and we expect that the business will continue to be a significant source of our future revenue.
 
Giga-tronics Division
 
Our Giga-tronics Division designs, manufactures and markets a family of functional test products for the RADAR/EW segment of the defense electronics market. Our RADAR/EW test products are used in a laboratory setting to evaluate and improve the performance of RADAR/EW systems. Giga-tronics Division customers include major prime defense contractors, the armed services (primarily in the U.S.) and research institutes.
 
Our goal is to be the leading supplier of solutions for evaluating RADAR and EW systems and we believe our Advanced Signal Generation and Analysis (“ASGA”) functional test platform, which we have been developing since 2012, will allow us to accomplish this goal. The same digital technology that has revolutionized commercial communications and automotive electronics is now being applied to advanced RADAR and EW systems. This shift in technology limits the effectiveness of traditional test solutions, which are unable to properly stimulate and actively interact with the RADAR and EW systems being tested. The Giga-tronics ASGA platform, however, has control capabilities and real-time behavior built into the fabric of its architecture. This architecture enables test solutions with real time responses and closed loop behavior that we believe is unavailable from any competitor.
 
Technology Shift in RADAR Technology
 
Historically, U.S. defense electronic systems have embodied the most advanced capabilities available. Major investments in integrated circuits, computing technology and signal processing algorithms, made by the U.S. Defense Department during the 1960s, through the 1980s, gave the U.S. its edge in defensive capability. However, these technologies slowly found their way into consumer products and services, such as desktop computers, music players, smartphones and the world-wide-web. The rapid acceleration and global proliferation of these technologies by commercial companies has allowed U.S. allies and potential adversaries alike to take a significant leap forward in RADAR and EW technology.

The democratization of these advanced technologies has permitted potential adversaries to “catch-up” and in many cases surpass U.S. military dominance in the air and at sea. The U.S. Defense Department recognizes these threats and has requested that Congress divert substantial resources from other programs to fund development of the next generation of RADAR and EW systems. These new systems may employ machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies that will require new approaches for test and evaluation. We believe the market for these new test technologies will remain robust even through typical business cycles.
 
Traditional open loop test techniques will also no longer be adequate to exercise the new cognitive systems through all their modes nor will they be able to interact in a closed loop manner to evaluate machine learning algorithms in real-time. We believe that prime contractors and government test facilities will require hardware-in-the-loop (“HWIL”) testing. HWIL testing calls for building a realistic simulation of the environment the new devices will experience when deployed. This means the new test solutions must stimulate the system under test (SUT) with high-fidelity signals and then modify its stimulation in real-time in response to the evolving behavior of the SUT. We believe our ASGA platform is the first to offer this closed-loop test functionality. Traditional test solutions that use synthesizers, modulators and spectrum analyzers are poorly suited to the task and this shift has provided a market opportunity for Giga-tronics. We believe, therefore, that competitors seeking to develop competing closed-loop test functionality face significant barriers because developing close-loop test systems requires a completely new investment from the ground up.
 
Giga-tronics’ Solution
 
Giga-tronics took the approach to develop a HWIL test platform similar to a RADAR or EW system in order to be prepared for the new challenges, but with the added difficult requirement of being broadband with real-time control of Frequency, Phase, and Amplitude. Giga-tronics limited its investment to the microwave portion of a RADAR or EW system’s architecture and has leveraged third party hardware partners to acquire the digital portion of the test solutions. Instead of building a traditional synthesizer, Giga-tronics developed a broad-band up-converter. Instead of building a spectrum analyzer, Giga-tronics invented a down-converter which uses a similar internal control structure as the up-converter. Consequently, we believe that Giga-tronics is the only solution provider able to offer a real-time closed loop RADAR emulator.
 
We developed our ASGA test systems to address three primary goals:
 

1. | Our ASGA solution was designed specifically for HWIL testing and offers a real-time, dynamic, closed loop test solution that simulates theses adaptive/cognitive RADAR/EW devices for RADAR design and testing purposes.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Our solution, which combines our ASGA platform with digital processing hardware and firmware, provides a test solution that may be customized with relative ease compared to traditional test systems.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Our ASGA solution is scalable, allowing us to build test systems with multiple channels that scale well both in terms of size and costs compared to traditional systems.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We developed our ASGA solution in three phases. First, building on our microwave RADAR component expertise, we developed a microwave up-converter, a down-converter, and a power amplifier. By using identical architecture and components as in the up-converter, for the down-converter, superior Radio Frequency (“RF”) performance is achieved, including:
 

• | phase stability and coherency,
--+-------------------------------


• | agile frequency switching,
--+---------------------------


• | real-time commanding of Frequency, Phase, and Amplitude, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | uniquely enabling a closed loop solution.
--+------------------------------------------

 
Second, we provided a microwave sub-system which includes individual calibrated transmit channels called the Advanced Signal Generator (ASG) and individual calibrated receive channels called the Advanced Signal Analyzer (ASA). A System Reference Module (SRM100A) shared between the ASG and ASA modules along with an industry standard AXIe chassis completes the platform. The platform’s architecture facilitates building test systems with reduced size, weight and cost compared with traditional solutions, especially when the test system is required to have multiple transmitters and receivers.

Third, we developed complete custom test solutions. Some examples of test solutions integrated by Giga-tronics are our Real-Time Threat Emulation System (TEmS) and the Multi-Ship RADAR Signal Generator sold to the US Navy at its Naval Air Station in Pt. Mugu, California.
 
By architecting a RADAR/EW test solution similarly to the way a RADAR system is architected, we have developed a disruptive product test platform which addresses the new adaptive/cognitive RADAR/EW test requirements.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Components
 
Substantially all the components required by Giga-tronics to make its assemblies are available from more than one source. We occasionally use sole source arrangements to obtain leading-edge technology or favorable pricing or supply terms, but not in any material volume. In our opinion, the loss of any sole source arrangement we have would not be materially adverse to our operations. Some suppliers are also competitors of Giga-tronics. In the event a competitor-supplier chooses not to sell its products to us, production delays could occur as we seek new suppliers or re-design components to our products.
 
Although extended delays in receipt of components from our suppliers could result in longer product delivery schedules for us, we believe that our protection against this possibility stems from our practices of dealing with well-established suppliers and maintaining good relationships with such suppliers.
 
Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Our competitive position is largely dependent upon our ability to provide performance specifications for our instruments and systems that (a) effectively and reliably meet customers’ needs and (b) selectively surpass competitors’ specifications in competing products. Patents may occasionally provide some short-term protection of proprietary designs. However, because of the rapid progress of technological development in our industry, such protection is often, although not always, short-lived. Therefore, although we occasionally pursue patent coverage, we place major emphasis on the development of new products with superior performance specifications and the upgrading of existing products toward this same end.
 
Our products are primarily based on our own designs, which are derived from our own engineering abilities. If our new product engineering efforts fall behind, our competitive position weakens. Conversely, effective product development greatly enhances our competitive status.
 
We have maintained four non-provisional patents related to our legacy 2500B parametric signal generator product line, which was not among the legacy product lines that have been sold to date. These patents describe advanced synthesis techniques and potentially can be extended for use with the Giga-tronics ASGA system and to a number of Microsource synthesizer components. Additionally, we filed a provisional U.S. patent relating to the ASGA system in June of 2016 and subsequently filed a non-provisional application in June of 2017. The patent application describes the internal design of the ASG and ASA along with the architecture of how all the components work together to facilitate building multi-channel test systems with reduced size, weight and cost as compared to present solutions. The application for the non-provisional patent is currently pending before the U.S. patent office.
 
We are not dependent on trademarks, licenses or franchises. We utilize certain software licenses in certain functional aspects for some of our products. Such licenses are readily available, non-exclusive and are obtained at either no cost or for a relatively small fee.
 
In September 2015, we entered into a software development agreement with a major aerospace and defense company whereby the aerospace company developed and licensed its simulation software to us. The simulation software (also called Open Loop Simulator or OLS technology), which is owned by the aerospace company and licensed to us, allows our ASGA system to coordinate with various third-party hardware elements to generate the signals for testing RADAR/EW equipment. We license the OLS software as a bundled or integrated solution with our TEmS product. We paid over $1.2 million in connection with the development of this software and, in addition, we incur a license fee of over $20,000 per system sold that incorporate this software.

Seasonal Nature of Business 
 
Our business is not seasonal.
 
Working Capital Practices
 
We generally strive to maintain adequate levels of inventory and we generally sell to customers on 30-day payment terms in the U.S. and generally allow more time for overseas payments. Typically, we receive payment terms of 30 days from our suppliers. We believe that these practices are consistent with typical industry practices.
Importance of Limited Number of Customers
 
We are a supplier of RADAR filters for fighter jet aircrafts and RADAR/EW testing solutions to various United States (U.S.) government defense agencies, as well as to their prime contractors. Management anticipates sales to U.S. government agencies and their prime contractors will remain a significant portion of all of our sale in fiscal 2020. U.S. and international defense-related agencies accounted for 98% of net sales in fiscal 2019 and 93% of net sales in fiscal 2018. Commercial business accounted for the remaining 2% of net sales in fiscal 2019 and 7% of net sales in fiscal 2018.
 
At the Giga-tronics Division, U.S. defense agencies and their prime contractors accounted for 90% and 10% of net sales in fiscal 2019 and 76% and 24% of net sales in fiscal 2018, respectively. Microsource reported 100% and 99% of net sales to prime contractors of U.S. defense agencies in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
 
During fiscal 2019, the Boeing Company accounted for 57% of our consolidated revenues and was included in the Microsource reporting segment. A second customer, Lockheed Martin accounted for 26% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2019 and was also included in the Microsource reporting segment.
 
During fiscal 2018, the Boeing Company accounted for 29% of our consolidated revenues and was included in the Microsource reporting segment. A second customer, CSRA LLC (CSRA acted as prime contractor for the United States Navy) accounted for 17% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2018 and was included in the Giga-tronics Division reporting segment.
 
We could experience a material adverse effect on our financial stability if there was a significant loss of either our defense or commercial customers.
 
Both Microsource and our Giga-tronics Division products are largely dependent on U.S. defense spending and budgets and are subject to expansion and contraction between fiscal year periods. Revenues from Microsource products and services often times span several years with deliveries varying between both interim and annual fiscal year periods. Additionally, the Giga-tronics Division’s ASGA system is a relatively new product platform with fewer targeted customers and significantly longer sales cycles and greater average selling prices when compared to its prior general-purpose test & measurement equipment product lines. We therefore expect that a major customer in one year may not be a major customer in the following year. Accordingly, our net sales and earnings may vary significantly from one period to the next and will decline if we are unable to find new customers or increase our business with other existing customers to replace declining net sales from the previous year’s major customers.
 
Backlog of Orders
 
On March 30, 2019, our backlog of unfilled orders was approximately $6.7 million compared to approximately $11.2 million at March 31, 2018. As of March 30, 2019, there were approximately $2.2 million of orders scheduled for shipment beyond one year, compared to $3.8 million at March 31, 2018. Orders for our products include program orders from prime contractors with extended delivery dates. Accordingly, the backlog of orders may vary substantially from year to year and the backlog entering any single fiscal quarter may not be indicative of sales for any period. In addition, the Company now recognizes revenue for certain contracts as it incurs costs, as opposed to when units are delivered. This change in fiscal 2019 has resulted in a decrease in backlog as of March 30, 2019 as compared to the legacy method for those contracts in the prior years.
 
Backlog includes only those customer orders for which binding agreement exists, a delivery schedule has been agreed upon between us and our customer and, in the case of U.S. government orders, for which funding has been appropriated.

Competition
 
The Company primarily competes in two different products markets: Microsource’s RADAR filters and Giga-tronics RADAR/EW test systems.
 
Microsource is a sole source supplier serving the aftermarket for operational hardware associated with the U.S. Government’s RADAR Modernization Program (RMP) for certain prior generation fighter jet aircrafts (F/A-18E, F-15D and F-16 jets) to extend their useful lives. Our Microsource division supplies RADAR filters specifically designed for military aircrafts to solve an interference problem created when newer, more powerful RADARs are installed on older aircrafts. Over the years, the prime contractors responsible for integrating the new RADARs have flight qualified our filters at considerable expense. Only a few other companies possess the technical know-how to design and manufacture filters of this nature, such as Teledyne and Micro-Lambda Wireless, but we believe the expense of developing and requalifying a new component for these aircraft is prohibitive to the point where the prime contractor would only undertake such an effort if major issues were to arise such as, significant technical deficiencies or if Microsource were unable to deliver products on time.
 
Microsource has received multiply supplier of the year awards including in April 2019 “The Gold Supplier” award from Boeing, so we believe our sole source position is secure.
 
The Giga-tronics Division serves the defense electronics market with a microwave test platform used in the evaluation of military RADAR/EW systems. These applications represent niche segments within the broader test equipment market. While the niche market segments of RADAR/EW are large enough to be meaningful to Giga-tronics, we believe they are too small to attract larger competitors, such as Agilent/Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz and National Instruments who, to our knowledge, do not approach these markets with new dedicated solutions.
 
We have developed a unique HWIL approach to address the RADAR/EW test requirements that are adaptive/cognitive. Testing these new RADAR and jamming (i.e. interference) signals is best solved by a real time, closed loop, dynamic simulation system. We believe our Giga-tronics RADAR/EW solutions present a paradigm shift providing a closed loop test capability that is currently unavailable elsewhere. Our competitors often have greater resources in research, development and manufacturing and substantially broader product lines and channels. To compete, we place strong emphasis on maintaining a high degree of technical competence as it relates to the development of new microwave products, are highly selective in establishing technological objectives and focus sales and marketing activities in the selected niche areas that are weakly served or underserved by our competitors. Competitors that make alternative equipment to the Giga-tronics Advanced Signal Generation and Analysis (ASGA) system include ELCOM (a division of Frequency Electronics Inc.), COMSTRON (a division of Cobham Plc) and EWST (a division of Ultra Electronics Plc). Compared to Giga-tronics, these competitors are of comparable size or have small product divisions with more limited product lines. Two larger companies, Northrop Grumman/Amherst and Textron/AAI sell open loop test equipment that competes with the Giga-tronics ASGA solutions, albeit at a much higher selling price. We do not believe that either of these suppliers are in a position to offer an adaptive closed loop testing system due to the analog nature of their systems’ architectures. Compared to our ASGA system, the test systems from Northrup Grumman and Textron have long delivery schedules, represent expensive capital investments to the customers and typically are shared among a large number of users generally limiting access to their testing capabilities. Giga-tronics’ ASGA solution can complement these larger test systems by addressing the new closed loop test requirements for the next generation RADAR/EW devices and by offering smaller, lower cost and more flexible testing solutions that can be delivered more quickly, which greatly increases a user’s access to systems test capability and reduces the risk of program failure.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Microsource and the Giga-tronics Division sell their products primarily direct to U.S. defense agencies and their prime defense contractors. While the Company primarily relies on its internal sales teams to identify leads and complete sales, it may engage independent sales representatives who are perceived to have expertise with targeted markets or customers.  The Company changed its sales approach and sales team in fiscal 2019 and we believe that we are beginning to see the benefits of these changes with the recent $4.0 million purchase order for our ASGA product platform. 
Product Development
 
Products of the type manufactured by Giga-tronics historically have had relatively long product life cycles. However, the electronics industry is subject to rapid technological changes at the component level. Our future success is dependent on our ability to steadily incorporate new functionality and advancements in component technologies into our new products. In fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, product development expenses totaled approximately $1.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively.
 
Our product development activities have historically been funded internally, through product line sales, or through outside equity investment and debt financing. Product development activities are expensed as incurred.
 
We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development. There can be no assurance that future technologies, processes or product developments will not render our current product offerings obsolete or that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to existing products that satisfy customer needs in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance. Failure to do so could adversely affect our business.

Manufacturing
 
The Company assembles and tests Microsource and Giga-tronics Division products at its Dublin facility. Microsource develops and manufactures RADAR filters used in fighter jet aircrafts. Our Giga-tronics Division manufactures a family of functional test products and integrates those test products along with third party hardware and software to create full test solutions for the RADAR/EW segment of the defense electronics market.
Environment
 
To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with all Federal, state and local laws and regulations involving the protection of the environment.
 
Employees
 
As of March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, we employed 39 and 43 individuals on a full-time basis, respectively. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Information about Foreign Operations
 
We sell to our international customers through a network of foreign technical sales representative organizations. All transactions between us and our international customers are in U.S. dollars.
