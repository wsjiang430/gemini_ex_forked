ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview

Cosmo Ventures Inc. (“Cosmo Ventures” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 3, 2013. We are an early stage company that plans to commence operations as an online retailer offering discounted overstocked inventory items. We intend to launch a web-based platform that will give our potential customers the ability to purchase our discounted products. Cosmo Ventures Inc. will procure merchandise purchased from the surplus inventories of manufacturers and retailers throughout India. 

Although the sale of discounted overstock products in an online marketplace is not entirely new, we anticipate that this medium will continue to grow. We believe that by providing a simple, yet effective, website platform, Cosmo Ventures will become a sought after marketplace for our e-consumers. Most cellular phones are equipped to handle text messages, emails, and mobile websites that contain information on our products. Having the ability to instantly contact potential customers both locally and nationwide is one of the major benefits of this marketing strategy. Cosmo Ventures can send instant coupons, promotional messages, and much more online to our opt-in subscribers.

We hope to realize our full plan of operations by raising additional funds through the additional sale of our Company stock. We will design a full marketing strategy to gain brand awareness, and ultimately obtain a large opt-in subscriber base.

We do not intend to carry a surplus inventory nor does our business require a storage facility. We intended to offer the public access to a variety of retailers and manufacturer products under one website. Our customers will purchase products that will be shipped directly from our future partnered suppliers, shipping cost will be an additional charge passed on to the consumer. Majority of our expenses will be incurred on marketing, employees, web and mobile development and maintenance. Our intention is to generate revenue from our future suppliers as we will offer them our marketing services to clear their overstock or retail items. We intend to charge our suppliers a fee based on the advertising package they choose, which will allow them to advertise a certain number or products per month on our website. We intend to establish a negotiated base rate on each item with our clients, once we list the items they will be sold at a price Cosmo has formulated and Cosmo is entitled to the additional profits, if any, on the items sold.

Once we secure additional funding through the sale of common stock we will rent a small office space in a location convenient to our business needs and suppliers. We have not secured an office location and will be contracting out to our web developer, and sales representative as their primary focus is field work. We will try to work within our budget to execute our business plan with our primary focus on web/mobile development before we secure a physical office location.

Our products will be sold in US dollar (USD) and our suppliers will be paid in Indian rupee’s (INR). Currency conversion will be a risk in which we may lose all our profits, as the market is unpredictable and fluctuates on a daily basis. Generally speaking the US dollar is more profitable than the Indian rupee and we hope to capitalize more on our profits with the exchange rate by using forward contracts with our future suppliers. A forward contract will allow us to agree on an exchange rate which is fixed at the time the contract is entered in to, and buy or sell currency at an agreed future date. Our vendors may not agree to these terms and we may lose additional money in foreign exchange fluctuations that will adversely affect our business. We have not yet established any relationships with suppliers for our business.

Industry Analysis/Competition

Market/Competition Analysis 

The Company’s challenge will be the increasing competition to attract customers to the website. We believe that too often, sales are lost because of complex websites that are far from intuitive. We intend to operate in a very competitive market and on popular search engines such as Google, Firefox Mozilla, and similar sites. Through advertising on popular search engines, our potential customers begin their search for online merchandise through general searches rather than through the established platforms of our competitors. We intend to spend large sums on acquiring search engine promotions. The only way to overcome the search engine filtering by customers is to build a strong brand so that when customers look for value, they know that Cosmo Ventures provides it and start their search directly from our website. We believe in order to be successful, an online web retailer must be a low cost operator, own a strong brand, attract high consumer traffic, offering quality merchandise and great prices with superior customer service.

The market for selling over stock items online is a relatively new, yet growing industry. We expect to compete with these other service providers principally on the bases of the quality of services we intend to offer customers and in our Company’s ability to acquire and retain personnel to market and sell our proposed services. Our Company will also compete on the bases of service price. Our principal competitors include BIDZ.com, Overstock.com, Amazon and Bluefly (all of which offer services similar to our proposed services). Numerous other second tier resellers are entering into the marketplace, consisting of independent marketing consultants who are reselling and not operating their own web and mobile platform.

We anticipate that most, if not all, of our competitors will initially have greater name and brand recognition and access to greater amounts of capital and established relationships with a larger base of current and potential customers. Because of their size and bargaining power, our competitors may be able to purchase equipment, supplies and services at lower prices than us in the initial stages of our development. As a result, our operations may be significantly and negatively impacted by our larger, more established competitors. Once we commence our operations, if we are not able to generate enough revenue by attracting new and existing businesses and/or by enticing users to opt into our services, we may be forced to cease operations.

The industry has minimal and low cost barriers to entry and therefore it is a very competitive market. We will face many large and small competitors in the e-commerce retail business, including eBay, Amazon, Buy.com, Shop.com, and other similar websites.

Easy entry does not necessarily mean that a new entrant can build a web presence, traffic, and customer base. The Cosmo Ventures business model consists of selling the overstock of other wholesale retailers from India in North America. Merchandise we intend to offer on our site will be competitively priced to benefit our potential customers. We believe an online business model is better positioned to succeed if it employs: brand/traffic, heaviest discounter reputation, low cost operations, and customer satisfaction.

We anticipate Overstock.com and Amazon (‘Competitors’) to be our biggest competition. Although we will be a smaller independent online, retailer one of our goals will be to attract our Competitor’s clients to our business. These two highly branded companies are well established with a worldwide presence. Our effort to compete with them shows the need for such companies, and higher online consumer purchases. Our point of difference from our competition is our Indian manufactured merchandise, which we believe will be enough to turn over some loyal customers who seek a bargain over brand.

Marketing Strategy

We have begun initial market research and anticipate conducting in depth market research to develop a strategy which in our opinion could launch our Company and provide us with rapid growth if executed properly.

We plan to focus on three key factors when marketing our services to local businesses:

Timing – With the ever-expanding market of mobile (and smartphone) users now is the time to make the most out of mobile website and application. We believe the competition is small at this point, and businesses can create a presence before it gets cluttered.

Integration – Mobile phone users are doing more and more on their phones, especially with the rise in smartphone sales. If a business is at all serious about a comprehensive and integrated marketing strategy for their company, mobile has to be a part of it.

Consumers – Businesses can put their products and services in front of their target market of consumers quickly and easily. We intend to use mobile marketing as a strategy for impulse consumer purchases.

We intend to market our business online with emails, door to door sales visits, and cold calling to build relationships and attract retailers. We intend to offer our first 100 customers unlimited online advertising as a sign-up incentive. Our sales representatives will bear the responsibility of field recruitment which we anticipate to bring in the bulk of our suppliers.

To obtain first time users, we plan to mail out flyers, run banner advertisements, and send out mass emails to direct web traffic to our web or mobile site. Our marketing efforts need to be consistent to drive a high volume of viewers to our webpage. We anticipate our conversion of first time browsers to purchasers will be 1 in every 75 viewers based on our products and prices. Our focus must remain on featured deals of the week and gorilla marketing to establish brand awareness.

We also intend to have a strong presence in social media, such as Facebook, twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn. The Company is also considering developing a App that will make it easier for consumers to access and purchase our overstock products.

Patent and Trademarks

We do no currently own any domestic or foreign patents relating to our proposed products.

Employees

As of March 31, 2019, other than its President, Mr. Ashok Kumar, the Company has no other employees.
