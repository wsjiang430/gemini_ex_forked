     ITEM 1.BUSINESS
     Overview and History
     We are a value-priced retailer of urban fashion apparel and accessories for the entire family.  Our merchandise offerings are designed to appeal to the fashion preferences of value-conscious consumers, particularly African-Americans. We believe that we provide merchandise at compelling values. Our goal is to provide merchandise at discounts to department and specialty stores’ regular prices of 20% to 70%. Our stores average approximately 11,000 square feet of selling space and are typically located in neighborhood shopping centers that are convenient to low and moderate income customers.  As of February 2, 2019, we operated 562 stores in both urban and rural markets in 32 states.
     Our predecessor, Allied Department Stores, was founded in 1946 and grew into a chain of family apparel stores operating in the Southeast. In 1999, the Company, then consisting of 85 stores, was acquired by a private equity firm. Following this acquisition, management implemented several strategies to focus on the growing urban market and improve our operating and financial performance. After the successful implementation of these strategies and the successful growth of our chain from 85 stores to 212 stores, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock on May 18, 2005.
     We are a Delaware corporation, and our executive offices are located at 104 Coleman Boulevard, Savannah, Georgia 31408 and our telephone number is (912) 236-1561. Our Internet address is http://www.cititrends.com. The reference to our web site address in this Report does not constitute the incorporation by reference of the information contained at the web site into this Report. We make available, free of charge through publication on our web site, copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed such materials with, or furnished such materials to, the SEC. In addition, you may read and print any materials we file with the SEC on the SEC’s web site at http://www.sec.gov.
     Company Strengths and Strategies
     Our goal is to be the leading value-priced retailer of urban fashion apparel and accessories. We believe the following business strengths differentiate us from our competitors and are important to our success:

 
  3

 

     Focus on Urban Fashion Mix. We focus our merchandise on urban fashions, which we believe appeal to our core customers. We do not attempt to dictate trends, but rather devote considerable effort to identifying emerging trends and ensuring that our apparel assortment is considered timely and fashionable in the urban market. Our merchandising staff tests new emerging merchandise trends before reordering and actively manages the mix of fashion and branded products in the stores to keep our offering fresh and minimize markdowns.
     Superior Value Proposition. As a value-priced retailer, we seek to offer top quality, fashionable merchandise at compelling prices in relation to department and specialty stores. We also offer products under our proprietary brands such as “Citi Steps” and “Red Ape.” These private brands enable us to expand our product selection, offer fashion merchandise at lower prices and enhance our product offerings.
     Merchandise Mix that Appeals to the Entire Family. We merchandise our stores to create a destination environment capable of meeting the fashion needs of the entire value-conscious family. Each store offers a wide variety of products for men and women, as well as children. Our stores feature sportswear, dresses, outerwear, footwear, intimate apparel, accessories, scrubs, beauty and home. We believe that the breadth of our merchandise distinguishes our stores from many competitors that offer urban apparel primarily for women, and reduces our exposure to fashion trends and demand cycles in any single category.
     Strong and Flexible Sourcing Relationships. We maintain strong sourcing relationships with a large group of suppliers. We have purchased merchandise from approximately 1,700 vendors in the past 12 months. Purchasing is controlled by a 50 member buying team located in one of our three buying offices - New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and our Savannah, Georgia headquarters. We purchase merchandise through planned programs with vendors at reduced prices and opportunistically through close-outs, with the majority of our merchandise purchased for the current season and a lesser quantity held for sale in future seasons. To foster vendor relationships, we pay vendors promptly and do not ask for typical retail concessions, such as promotional and markdown allowances.
     Attractive Fashion Presentation and Store Environment. We seek to provide a fashion-focused shopping environment that is similar to a specialty apparel retailer, rather than a typical off-price store. Products are prominently displayed by style, rather than by size, on dedicated, four-way fixtures featuring multiple sizes and styles.  The remaining merchandise is arranged on hanging racks.  The stores are carpeted and well-lit, with most featuring a sound system that plays urban adult and urban contemporary music throughout the store. 
     Cost-Effective Store Locations. We locate stores in high traffic strip shopping centers that are convenient to low and moderate income neighborhoods. We generally utilize previously occupied store sites which enables us to obtain attractive rents. Similarly, advertising expenses are low as we do not rely on promotion-driven sales but rather seek to build our reputation for value through everyday low prices. At the same time, from an investment perspective, we seek to design stores that are inviting and easy to shop, while limiting startup and fixturing costs.
     Product Merchandising and Pricing
     Products. Our merchandising strategy is to offer fashionable urban apparel and accessories at attractive prices for the entire value-conscious family. We seek to maintain a diverse assortment of first quality, in-season merchandise that appeals to the distinctive tastes and preferences of our core customers. Approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 were represented by nationally recognized brands. We also offer a wide variety of products from less recognized brands and a lesser amount representing private label products under our proprietary brands.
     Our merchandise includes apparel, accessories and home. Within apparel, we offer fashion sportswear for men, women and children, including offerings for newborns, infants, toddlers, boys and girls. Accessories include handbags, jewelry, footwear, belts, intimate apparel, scrubs and sleepwear.  Home includes functional bedroom, bathroom and kitchen products, as well as beauty and toys.
     The following table sets forth the merchandise assortment by classification as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016.
    
 | Percentage of Net Sales | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Accessories | 32 | % | 32 | % | 31 | %
Children’s | 23 | % | 23 | % | 23 | %
Ladies’ | 22 | % | 23 | % | 24 | %
Men’s | 17 | % | 17 | % | 17 | %
Home | 6 | % | 5 | % | 5 | %

 Pricing. We purchase our merchandise at attractive prices and mark prices up less than department or specialty stores. We seek to provide nationally recognized brands at prices that are 20% to 70% below regular retail prices available in department stores and specialty stores.  Further, we consider the price-to-value relationships of our non-branded products to be exceptionally strong. Both branded and non-branded offerings validate our value and fashion positioning to our customers. We review each department in our stores at least monthly for possible markdowns based on sales rates and fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of inventory and to accelerate the flow of current merchandise.  In late 2019, we plan to implement a Markdown Optimization System, which is expected to improve our ability to determine optimal price reductions and timing, minimize end-of-season inventory and provide the ability to execute markdowns at the store level.
     Sourcing and Allocation
     The merchandising department oversees the sourcing, planning and allocation of merchandise to our stores, which allows us to utilize volume purchase discounts and maintain control over our inventory. We source our merchandise from approximately 1,700 vendors, consisting of domestic manufacturers and importers. Our merchandising department consists of a buying team of 50 merchants and a planning and allocation team, which is comprised of over 30 associates.
     The buyers on our buying team have, on average, 15 years of experience in the retail business and have developed long-standing relationships with many of our vendors, including those controlling the distribution of branded apparel. Our buyers, who are based in New York, Los Angeles and Savannah, travel regularly to the major United States apparel markets, visiting major manufacturers and attending national and regional trade shows, including urban-focused trade shows.
     Our buyers purchase merchandise in styles, sizes and quantities to meet inventory levels developed by the planning staff. The buying staff utilizes several purchasing techniques that enable us to offer to customers branded and non-branded fashion merchandise at everyday low prices. The majority of the nationally recognized branded products we sell are purchased in-season, and we generally purchase later in the merchandising buying cycle than department and specialty stores. This allows us to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demands for specific merchandise and manufacturers’ supply of that merchandise. We also purchase merchandise from some vendors in advance of the selling season at reduced prices and purchase merchandise on an opportunistic basis near the end of the selling season, which we then store in our distribution centers for sale three to nine months later. Where possible, we seek to purchase items based on style or color in limited quantities on a test basis with the right to reorder as needed. Finally, we purchase private brand merchandise that we source to our specifications.
     We allocate merchandise across our store base according to sales and merchandise plans that are created by our planning and allocation teams. The merchandising staff utilizes a centralized management system to monitor merchandise purchasing, planning and allocation in order to maximize inventory turnover, identify and respond to changing product demands and determine the timing of markdowns to our merchandise. The recent addition of a store-level planning system assists our team in their efforts to allocate merchandise to individual stores based on local customer preferences.  The buyers also regularly review the age and condition of the merchandise and manage both the reordering and clearance processes. In addition, the merchandising team communicates with regional, district and store managers to ascertain regional and store-level conditions and to better ensure that our product mix meets our consumers’ demands in terms of quality, fashion, price and overall value.
     We accept payment from our customers for merchandise at time of sale. Payments are made to us by cash, check, Visa™, MasterCard™, American Express™, or Discover™. We do not extend credit terms to our customers; however, we do offer a layaway service.
     Seasonality
     The nature of our business is seasonal. Historically, sales in the first and fourth quarters have been higher than sales achieved in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. Expenses and, to a greater extent, operating income, vary by quarter. Results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year. Furthermore, the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods.     Store Operations
     Store Format. The average selling space of our 562 stores is approximately 11,000 square feet, which allows us the space and flexibility to departmentalize our stores and provide directed traffic patterns. We arrange most of our stores in a racetrack format with ladies’ sportswear in the center of each store and complementary categories adjacent to those items. Men’s and boy’s apparel and footwear are displayed on one side of the store, while dresses, ladies’ footwear and accessories are displayed on the other side. Merchandise for

infants, toddlers, boys and girls, as well as home goods, are displayed along the back of the store. Impulse items, such as jewelry and sunglasses, are featured near the checkout area. Products from nationally recognized brands and other current fashion styles are prominently displayed on four-way racks at the front of each department. The remaining merchandise is displayed on hanging racks and occasionally on table displays. Large hanging signs identify each category location. The unobstructed floor plan allows the customer to see virtually all of the different product areas from the store entrance and provides us the flexibility to easily expand and contract departments in response to customer demand, seasonality and merchandise availability. Virtually all of our inventory is displayed on the selling floor.
     Store Management. Store operations are managed by our Senior Vice President of Store Operations, four regional vice presidents and 51 district managers, each of whom manages eight to fifteen stores. The typical store is staffed with a store manager, two or three assistant managers and seven to eight part-time sales associates, all of whom rotate work days on a shift basis. Store managers and assistant store managers participate in a bonus program based on achieving predetermined levels of sales and inventory shrinkage. District managers participate in bonus programs based on achieving targeted levels of sales, profits, inventory shrinkage and payroll costs. Regional Vice Presidents participate in a bonus program based partly on a roll-up of the district managers’ bonuses and partly on the Company’s profit performance in relation to budget. Sales associates are compensated on an hourly basis with incentives. Moreover, we recognize individual performance through internal promotions and provide opportunities for advancement.
     We place significant emphasis on loss prevention in order to control inventory shrinkage. Initiatives include electronic tags on many of our products, training and education of store personnel on loss prevention issues, digital video camera systems, alarm systems and motion detectors in the stores. We also visually monitor the stores throughout the day using sophisticated camera systems, capture extensive point-of-sale data and maintain systems that monitor returns, voids and employee sales, and produce trend and exception reports to assist in identifying shrinkage issues. We have a centralized loss prevention team that focuses exclusively on implementation of these initiatives and specifically on stores that have experienced above average levels of shrinkage. We also maintain an independent, third party administered, toll-free line for reporting shrinkage concerns and any other employee concerns.
     Employee Training. Our employees are critical to achieving our goals, and we strive to hire employees with high energy levels and motivation. We have well-established store operating policies and procedures and an extensive 30-day in-store training program for new store managers and assistant managers. Sales associates also participate in a 14-day customer service and store procedures training program, which is designed to enable them to assist customers in a friendly, helpful manner.
     Layaway Program. We offer a layaway program that allows customers to purchase merchandise by initially paying a 20% deposit and a $2 service charge, although at various times, we have reduced the deposit requirement to 10% and waived the service charge in connection with promotional events. The customer then makes additional payments every two weeks and has 60 days within which to complete the purchase. If the purchase is not completed, the customer receives a Citi Trends gift card for amounts paid less a re-stocking and layaway service fee.
     Site Selection. Cost-effective store locations are an important part of our store profitability model. Accordingly, we look for second and third use store locations that offer attractive rents, but also meet our demographic and economic criteria. We have a dedicated real estate management team responsible for new store site selection. In selecting a location, we target both urban and rural markets. Demographic criteria used in site selection include concentrations of our core consumers. In addition, we require convenient site accessibility, as well as strong co-tenants, such as food stores, dollar stores and rent-to-own stores.
     Shortly after we sign a new store lease and complete the necessary leasehold improvements to the building, we prepare the store over a three to four week period by installing fixtures, signs, dressing rooms, checkout counters and cash register systems and merchandising the initial inventory.
     Advertising and Marketing
     Our marketing goals are to build the “Citi Trends” brand, promote customers’ association of the “Citi Trends” brand with value, quality, fashion and everyday low prices, and drive traffic into our stores. We generally focus our advertising efforts during the first quarter (Spring/Easter), back-to-school and Christmas through the use of hip-hop radio stations, social media and influencer marketing.  In addition, we promote fashion trends and exciting deals in our window signage and through in-store announcements.  In 2011, we started a Facebook page which has grown to nearly 600,000 followers.

 Distribution
     All merchandise sold in our stores is shipped directly from our distribution centers in Darlington, South Carolina and Roland, Oklahoma, utilizing various express package distributors. Our stores receive multiple shipments of merchandise from our distribution centers each week. The Darlington distribution center has 550,000 square feet of space, while the Roland distribution center has 565,000 square feet of space.
     We have engaged a consulting firm to help us identify more efficient and less costly distribution alternatives.  Likely opportunities include implementing a transportation management system; leveraging the consultant’s relationships with transportation service providers; expanding the number of in-bound trucking options; and evaluating the current out-bound to store model.  This project has begun and is expected to continue into 2020.  Benefits from these efforts are expected to begin in the second quarter of 2019 and continue to grow throughout the life of the project.
     Information Technology and Systems
     We have information systems in place to support our core business functions, using a combination of industry-standard third party products and internally developed applications.  These systems support purchase order management, price and markdown management, merchandise planning and allocation, general ledger, accounts payable, sales audit, loss prevention and supply chain functions.  We continue to evaluate and implement new technologies to enhance the execution of our merchandising strategies, improve our operating efficiencies and maintain financial control.  
     In 2018, we completed the rollout of our store-level planning system which allows for improved allocations at each level of the merchandise hierarchy.  In addition, we launched a new retail analytics solution which provides transaction based reporting to assist with loss prevention activities.
     Our 2019 projects include: 

· | Markdown Optimization System – expected to determine optimal price reductions and timing, minimize end-of-season inventory, and provide the ability to execute markdowns at the store level
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transportation Management System – expected to optimize in-bound and out-bound shipments resulting in transportation cost savings
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Warehouse Packing System – expected to improve merchandise packing efficiency, leading to an expected reduction in payroll costs
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Point-of-Sale System replacement – initiation of a project to replace our existing point-of-sale environment which is expected to improve operational and transactional processes, establish an enterprise return management system to reduce return fraud, and provide the foundation for future business initiatives.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The security of our information technology systems is critical to us.  We use commercially available security systems to protect Company, employee, customer and vendor information, and we employ a cybersecurity program to address ongoing security threats.  Our program includes, but is not limited to, routine penetration and vulnerability testing, network segmentation, strong encryption protocols, virus and malware protection, email security scanning, simulation training, vendor assessments, and ongoing monitoring and patching activities.  Within our stores, we use external chip-accepting pin pad devices which employ point-to-point encryption technology for the protection of our customer’s payment information.  We do not retain encrypted, hashed, or tokenized payment information within our internal systems.  In addition, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry’s Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) to which we attest compliance annually.
     We believe that our information systems, with upgrades and updates over time, are adequate to support our operations for the foreseeable future.
     Growth Strategy
     Drive Comparable Store Sales Growth. We have a number of strategies in place that are focused on continuing to increase our comparable store sales, including the following:
· | Continued push toward lines of business that have proven to be consistent sales drivers over extended periods of time, including, among other things, accessories and home merchandise,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improvement of our fashion assortments within apparel to meet the demands of our unique customer base,

      Increase Store Base. We believe that our store potential for the existing concept is up to 800 stores.  This concept, which has historically done well in predominantly African-American markets, has proven to be portable across much of the country.  In fact, of the twenty Citi Trends stores with the highest level of profit, sixteen are located in different cities.  Also, only six of our stores are not profitable on a four-wall basis.
     After opening nineteen new stores in fiscal 2018, we plan to open approximately twenty new stores in fiscal 2019, including our first test stores in markets that are predominantly Hispanic.  We already serve the Hispanic consumer in many of our stores, although not at the same level as the African-American consumer.  We currently have 36 stores with at least 40% Hispanic population within three miles.  These stores, on average, have sales that are approximately 9% higher than our average store, while attaining profit levels that are virtually identical to the average store.  As a result, we have a sampling of existing stores that we can use as guides in determining how to appropriately merchandise stores in Hispanic markets.
     Competition
     The markets we serve are highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in the retail business are fashion, assortment, pricing and presentation. We believe we have a competitive advantage in our offering of fashionable merchandise at everyday low prices. We compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national off-price retailers, mass merchants, smaller specialty retailers and dollar stores. The off-price retail companies with which we compete include TJX Companies, Inc. (“TJX Companies”), Ross Stores, Inc. (“Ross Stores”), The Cato Corporation (“Cato”), and Burlington Stores, Inc. (“Burlington”).  In particular, Ross Stores’ “dd’s DISCOUNTS” stores, and Cato’s “It’s Fashion Metro” stores target lower and moderate income consumers. We believe our strategy of appealing to African-American consumers and offering urban apparel products allows us to compete successfully with these retailers. We also believe we offer a more inviting store format than the traditional off-price retailers, including our use of carpeted floors and more prominently displayed brands. In addition, we compete with a group of smaller specialty retailers that sell only women’s products, such as Rainbow, as well as value-oriented retailers, such as Forman Mills and Variety Wholesalers. Our mass merchant competitors include Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart. These chains do not focus on fashion apparel and, within their apparel offering, lack the urban focus that we believe differentiates our offering and appeals to our core customers. Similarly, while some of the dollar store chains offer apparel, they typically offer a more limited selection focused on basic apparel needs. As a result, we believe there is significant demand for a value-priced retailer that addresses the market of low and moderate income consumers generally and, particularly, African-American and other consumers who seek value-priced, urban fashion apparel, accessories and home goods. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report for additional information regarding competition in our markets.     Intellectual Property
     We regard our trademarks and service marks as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts. We have registered “Citi Trends” as a trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register for retail department store services. We have also registered the following trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register for various apparel: “Citi Steps,” “Citi Trends Fashion for Less,” “Lil Ms Hollywood,” “Red Ape,” and “Vintage Harlem.” Our policy is to pursue registration of our marks and to oppose vigorously infringement of our marks.     Employees
     As of February 2, 2019, we had approximately 2,800 full-time and approximately 2,700 part-time employees. Of these employees, approximately 4,700 are employed in our stores and the remainder are employed in our distribution centers, buying offices and corporate office. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, and none of our employees are represented by a labor union.
