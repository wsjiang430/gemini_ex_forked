 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  INTRODUCTION 
  Shoal Games Ltd. (TSXV : SGW) (www.shoalgames.com) is the parent company of a group of companies, which creates software products focused on the children's digital entertainment and advertising technology markets.  The Company is managed by an experienced team of executives who have a long history in games, enterprise software, mobile software, advertising technology and Internet products.  
  Shoal Games has been focused on consumer products with the Rooplay Edtech platform for children and families.  Rooplay is a subscription games system with no ads, no in-app purchases, no long downloads, no instant messaging, and no outbound links of any form.  These characteristics make the product a unique platform of game content that is entirely safe for children.  Rooplay mixes entertainment with education so that long player sessions are created in a safe environment so that children have fun and are challenged in new ways with every session.
  On March 4, 2019 the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Kidoz Ltd. ("Kidoz") (www.kidoz.net), a privately held Israeli company engaged in childrens' digital content distribution and monetization.  The Acquisition enables the global reach of Kidoz's content discovery network to be efficiently combined with Shoal Games' Rooplay subscription OTT platform, to create a unique player in the high growth digital kids market.  The combined company is positioned to grow through exclusive ownership of content which the Kidoz network will make accessible to tens of millions of kids each month, utilizing our proprietary OTT subscription platform and a kid-safe monetization platform to attract top kids advertisers.
  With more than 6.8 billion mobile phone subscriptions in place globally the demand for mobile content and monetization systems is enormous.  Rooplay and Kidoz fill particular needs in the market with consumers, publishers, and advertisers all demanding safety and engagement from the digital kids' content.  
  Shoal Games management believes that through the development of the Rooplay and Kidoz platforms, and the integration of EdTech content into our global network that it can create a unique and defensible position in the market.  Rooplay generates revenue for the Company from consumer subscriptions which customers pay to unlock the Rooplay game catalog.  Kidoz generates revenue through the sale of advertising to brands and the delivery of ads through its global content network.  Kidoz also generates licensing revenue to OEM manufacturers who wish to install the Kidoz safe operating system on their hardware products.  Shoal Games management believes that the development of a platform system that optimizes the strengths of both Rooplay and Kidoz will create multiple sustainable revenue streams for the Company.

  Development of the Business
  The focus of Shoal Games is the development and expansion of the Rooplay edugame platform and the Kidoz content discovery network.  It is management's objective to integrate the global distribution capabilities of the Kidoz network with the monetization capacity of the Rooplay content platform to unlock large recurring revenue opportunities.
  Shoal Games Domain Names
  Shoal Games owns the domain names Rooplay.com, Shoalgames.com, Shoalgames.net, Shoalmedia.com, Garfieldsbingo.com, Trophybingo.com, Trophybingo.ca and Kidoz.net and many other smaller domains.  
  BUSINESS OVERVIEW
  Shoal Games management believes the global reach of the Kidoz's content discover network should be efficiently combined with Shoal Games' Rooplay subscription OTT platform to create a unique company in the high growth digital kids market.  The combined company is positioned to grow through exclusive ownership of Rooplay content which the Kidoz network will make accessible to tens of millions of kids each month.
 Product Strategy
  Rooplay is a Netflix of games for children and families.  Kidoz is a leading monetization and discovery system reaching millions of kids and families every month.  Shoal Games' product strategy is to align the synergies of these two systems to bring safe and highly monetizing content to families in every region of the world. 
 Marketing & Distribution Strategy
  Shoal Games pursues both business-to-consumer strategies and a business-to-business strategies with Rooplay and Kidoz.  With the Company's direct to consumer strategy, new users of Rooplay are created via paid performance marketing, search engine marketing, word-of-mouth, and from placements in the Kidoz network.  The Company's business-to-business strategy involves selling advertising to premium brands (Disney, Lego, Crayola, ect) and distributing these ads across the Kidoz network.  Shoal Games intends to link these two strategies to create a global content and monetization system that is a market leader. 
 Pricing Strategy
  Rooplay subscriptions offer a free trial to all users and then a monthly recurring subscription fee is charged directly to customers.  The Kidoz network is a unique discovery platform in the market and commands high prices in top tier markets.  The Company is tasked with growing revenues on the network from other regions in the world that currently do not generate significant revenue for the company despite providing considerable traffic on the network.

  Growth Strategy
  The combination of distribution power and content ownership is one of the most effective business strategies in media and entertainment.  With a focused approach targeted solely on the kids market, Shoal Games intends to grow organically by building a leadership position within the kids digital industry for quality content, global reach, revenue potential and by accretive acquisitions.
 International Strategy
  While English speaking markets are the number one opportunity for revenues in the short term, they are also the focus of the majority of the competition.  Shoal Games is developing an integrated content strategy that will enable international growth opportunities in the largest non-English regions of the world.

  Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Kidoz Ltd. ("Kidoz"), an Israel-based industry-leader in the global kids' content distribution and monetization marketplace.

  Trophy Bingo & Garfield's Bingo
  The Company has completed the social bingo games Trophy Bingo and Garfield's Bingo which are available on Apple's iOS, Google's Android and Amazon Android systems.  Revenue is generated in the games via in-app purchases and advertising.  Shoal Games management continues to support Trophy Bingo and Garfield's bingo to grow revenues and provide cash to the Company. 
 OPERATIONS 
  Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had eight full-time employees, not including temporary personnel, consultants, and independent contractors. Since 2006 it has been, and continues to be, the Company's objective to control its costs by retaining consultants, as needed, to provide special expertise in developing internal strategic, marketing, accounting and technical services. None of our employees or consultants are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relationship with our employees and consultants is good.
  We are substantially dependent upon the continued services and performance of J. M. Williams, Chief Executive Officer; T. M. Williams, Executive Chairman and Eldad Ben Tora Chief Executive Officer of Kidoz Ltd.  The loss of the services of these key individuals would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not carry any key man life insurance on any individuals.
  Seasonality
  We do not believe that seasonality has an effect on our product demand or our revenue realization.
  Competition
  Rooplay competes with systems such as ABCMouse, Homer, Lingokids, and other learning products that are based on subscription.  Rooplay differs in that it is not only an educational system, but an entertainment system with hundreds of games both for fun and learning.  ABCMouse raised US$150 million at a valuation of more than US$1Billion.  The Company views the success of ABCMouse as proof of the size of the market and is developing Rooplay to be a superior and differentiated product. 
  Kidoz competes with other advertising technology providers that offer safe, COPPA compliant, products.  These companies include Super Awesome and Google's Admob.  Kidoz offers a highly customized and targeted offering to advertisers that management believes will enable the Company to grow and succeed in the market.
  Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
  The Company is in the business of developing and marketing Rooplay, Kidoz, Garfield's Bingo, and Trophy Bingo. To the best of our knowledge, no federal, state or local environmental laws are applicable to our business.
