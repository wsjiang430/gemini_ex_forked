Overview 
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel cancer immunotherapy products designed to harness the power of a patient’s own immune system to eradicate cancer cells. Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte, or TIL, therapy is a platform technology that has already been studied for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and metastatic cervical cancer and other solid tumors by the National Cancer Institute, or NCI. Our lead product candidate, lifileucel for metastatic melanoma, previously known as LN-144, is an autologous adoptive cell therapy utilizing TIL, which are T cells derived from patients’ tumors. We are also developing a second product candidate, an autologous adoptive cell therapy utilizing TIL for the treatment of cancers other than metastatic melanoma, which is known as LN-145. We are investigating the effectiveness and safety of TIL therapy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, cervical cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer through company sponsored trials, as well as for other oncology indications in investigator-sponsored trials. Our sponsored clinical trials and our investigator-sponsor clinical trials are described in more detail below.
 
We have an on-going Phase 2 clinical trial, C-144-01, of our lead product candidate, lifileucel, for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. This multicenter trial is enrolling patients with melanoma whose disease has progressed following treatment with at least one systemic therapy, including a PD-1 inhibitor and if BRAF mutated, a BRAF, or BRAF/MEK inhibitor (National Clinical Trial identification number NCT02360579). The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lifileucel. The C-144-01 trial uses our proprietary Generation 2, or Gen 2, manufacturing process. We completed and closed Cohort 2 in this trial in 2018, and a new single-arm registrational cohort, Cohort 4, of this trial began enrollment in early 2019.
 
In addition to our ongoing trial in metastatic melanoma, we have initiated clinical trials of LN-145, TIL therapy in cervical, head and neck, and other cancers. C-145-04 is an ongoing Phase 2, multicenter trial that will assess the safety and efficacy of LN-145 for the treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic or persistent cervical cancer (NCT03108495). C-145-03 is an ongoing Phase 2, multicenter trial that will enroll up to 47 patients and will assess the safety and efficacy of LN-145 for the treatment of patients with recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (NCT03083873).
 
We are investigating the potential of our TIL therapies in earlier lines of treatment. IOV-COM-202 is a Phase 2, multicenter trial that is composed of three cohorts to enroll up to a total of 36 patients. In Cohort 1, we intend to enroll advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients who have not received prior immunotherapy including checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy. The patients will receive lifileucel in combination with pembrolizumab. In Cohort 2, we intend to enroll advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients who are also naïve to prior immunotherapy including anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy. The patients will receive LN-145 in combination with pembrolizumab. In Cohort 3, we intend to enroll non-small cell lung cancer patients who have previously received systemic therapy which could include checkpoint inhibitors. This trial is open for patient enrollment (NCT03645928).
 
We are also investigating TIL therapy in non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, in combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy. We have initiated a trial, IOV-LUN-201, in anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 naïve patients for the treatment of patients with a combination of LN-145 and durvalumab (NCT03419559). This trial was initiated in the first half of 2018 and is a collaboration with MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca. In addition to this trial, we have financially sponsored an investigator-sponsored trial in NSCLC in collaboration with the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, or Moffitt, Stand Up To Cancer, and others evaluating the combination of TIL therapy and nivolumab (NCT03215810). Patients who are treatment naïve to prior anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 therapy with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC are being enrolled in this trial. Patients receive the TIL product if they do not respond to treatment with nivolumab. The TIL product is manufactured by Moffitt for this trial. Patient dosing began in the fourth quarter of 2017, and preliminary results from the Moffitt trial were presented at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in September 2018.
 
As part of our collaboration program with the MD Anderson Cancer Center, or MDACC, two new Phase 2 trials were initiated in 2018. The first trial, 2017-0672 (NCT03449108), is intended to allow for investigation of LN-145 manufactured by us using our Gen 2 manufacturing process to treat patients with soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma and platinum resistant ovarian cancer. A second trial under the collaboration with MDACC is now active as well (NCT03610490). This trial will use TIL manufactured by MDACC using urelumab as part of the manufacturing process. Both trials are sponsored by MDACC.
 
Our current product candidate pipeline and selected investigator-sponsored proof-of-concept studies are summarized in the graph below:

For the two investigator-sponsored trials listed in our pipeline graph above, MDACC is the sponsor. For one of the studies, NCT03610490, MDACC uses its own manufacturing process, referred to here as MDACC TIL. The data obtained using this manufacturing process may not be representative of our data.
 
2018 Developments
 
In 2018, we reported several significant events, including the following:
 
Clinical
 
· | Enrollment in Cohort 2 of our global Phase 2 lifileucel metastatic melanoma clinical trial, C-144-01, reached full enrollment in late 2018 and was therefore closed for further enrollment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We presented new data from Cohort 2 of the C-144-01 clinical trial in a poster and as an oral presentation at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, or SITC, 33rd Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. on November 7-11, 2018. The presentation included interim analysis of 47 consecutively dosed patients with an objective response rate, or ORR, of 38%, with a median duration of response, or DOR, as of the date of the data extract, of 6.4 months and range of 1.3+ to 14+ months. The ORR includes one complete response and 17 partial responses. Patients in Cohort 2 had a mean of 3.3 prior systemic therapies and all the patients had received anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The most common treatment emergent adverse events observed in Cohort 2 to date include chills, febrile neutropenia, anemia, decreased platelet count, pyrexia, and hypophosphataemia. Two grade 5 events were reported, one not related to TIL therapy and one possibly related to TIL therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We continued patient dosing in our C-145-04 clinical trial for cervical cancer. We dosed our first patient in Europe in this trial. This design is based on a Simon’s two-stage design. The first stage has been completed and enrollment in the trial continues with target enrollment of 47. The preliminary data from the trial for 15 patients was an ORR of 27% with a DOR ranging from 2.4 to 2.5+ months. Patients in the trial had a median of five prior therapies. The safety findings from this trial remain consistent with previous reports. The most common treatment emergent adverse events observed to date include chills, pyrexia, anemia, hypotension, platelet count decrease, and vomiting. The protocol for this trial has been amended to limit the number of prior therapies to no more than three and to exclude patients who have been treated with prior immunotherapy, and to use Gen 2 TIL manufacturing. We anticipate providing an update on this trial in 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In our C-145-03 clinical trial for head and neck cancer, to date, preliminary data for 13 patients was an ORR of 31%, with 4 partial responses, with the DOR ranging from 2.8 to 7.6 months. Patients in the trial had a median of three prior therapies. The safety findings from this trial are also consistent with previous reports. The protocol for this trial has been amended to use Gen 2 TIL manufacturing. The most common treatment emergent adverse events observed to date include chills, hypotension, pyrexia, hyponatremia, and anemia.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We amended the protocol for our clinical trial in NSCLC in collaboration with MedImmune, IOV-LUN-201, to eliminate the TIL monotherapy cohort. Patients will now be enrolled for treatment with LN-145 and durvalumab. There are currently nine sites active for this trial.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our clinical trial in PD-1 naïve melanoma and head and neck patients with TIL therapy in combination with pembrolizumab, and LN-145 as monotherapy in NSCLC patients, IOV-COM-202, was opened to enrollment with two sites active.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As of the end of 2018, we have expanded to over 90 clinical sites for our five company-sponsored studies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory
 
· | We received Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation for lifileucel for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We held an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA during which the FDA acknowledged that a single-arm cohort as part of the C-144-01 clinical trial could be supportive of initial registration of lifileucel and that conduct of a randomized Phase 3 trial in the patient population being enrolled may not be feasible. We began patient enrollment in a new cohort, Cohort 4, of our C-144-01 clinical trial in early 2019. This will be a single-arm cohort for registration in metastatic melanoma in a patient population that is post PD-1 blocking antibody and, if BRAF mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor or BRAF inhibitor with MEK inhibitor. We expect to fully enroll the necessary patients into this cohort by late 2019 or early 2020. Cohort 4 is expected to enroll 75 patients. The primary endpoint is ORR as determined by Blinded Independent Review Committee, or BIRC. This protocol was submitted and approved by the FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research
 
· | Under a collaboration with the Ohio State University, we have developed a product candidate called peripheral blood lymphocytes, or PBLs. A clinical program to administer PBLs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients is expected to begin in 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We presented preclinical data from our PD-1 selected TIL therapy, one of our next-generation TIL products, at SITC in November 2018.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Under a research collaboration with Roswell Park Cancer Institute, or RPCI, we performed preclinical studies of TIL therapy in bladder cancer. An investigator-sponsored clinical trial of TIL in bladder cancer patients at RPCI is expected to begin in 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We announced a preclinical research collaboration with Cellectis S.A., or Cellectis, to investigate transcription activator-like effector nucleases, or TALEN, for genetic editing in conjunction with TIL therapy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We announced a preclinical research collaboration with Phio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Phio, to investigate self-delivering ribonucleic acid interference methods for altering genetic expression in conjunction with TIL therapy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing
 
· | We announced a new three-year manufacturing services agreement, or MSA, with MaSTherCell S.A, or MaSTherCell. MaSTherCell will manufacture TIL therapies for our European late-stage clinical trials in its commercial-ready current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, manufacturing suites. The MSA increases our capacity for manufacturing TIL therapies in Europe.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We announced that we intend to begin building our own commercial manufacturing facility in the U.S. in 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Corporate
 
· | In January 2018 we closed an underwritten public offering of 15,000,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $11.50 per share, before underwriting discounts. The shares sold included 1,956,521 shares issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriter of its option to purchase additional shares at the public offering price, less the underwriting discount. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, were $162.0 million.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In October 2018, we closed an underwritten public offering of 25,300,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.97 per share, before underwriting discounts. The shares sold included 3,300,000 shares issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriter of its option to purchase additional shares at the public offering price, less the underwriting discount. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, were $236.7 million.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We obtained two U.S. patents, U.S Patent Nos. 10,130,659 and 10,166,257, covering therapeutic methods based upon our proprietary Gen 2 TIL manufacturing process.

Corporate Strategy
 
Our goal is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of TIL-based immunotherapies to treat solid tumors. We are developing a portfolio of TIL-based product candidates with the potential to meaningfully improve survival and quality of life for cancer patients. Key elements of our strategy include:
 
Expedite clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of our lead product candidate lifileucel for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.
 
Based on results of TIL therapy from trials sponsored by the NCI and our own clinical trials in metastatic melanoma, we are focused on expediting the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our lead product candidate, lifileucel, for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. We filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, with the FDA in December 2014 to initiate a company-sponsored Phase 2 single-arm, multicenter clinical trial of lifileucel in patients with metastatic melanoma. We began enrollment of this trial in the second half of 2015 and expanded it into three cohorts in 2017. In 2019 we will expand into an additional cohort, Cohort 4, which will serve as the basis for registration. Cohort 1 evaluated our first-generation TIL manufacturing process, Cohort 2 evaluated our second-generation, Gen 2, TIL manufacturing process and Cohort 3 evaluated retreatment of certain patients with a second dose of TIL. We announced initial data from the first two arms of this trial at the ASCO and SITC Annual Meetings in 2017 and presented updated data from Cohort 2 in November 2018 at SITC. Patient enrollment in Cohort 4 began in early 2019.

We held an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in September 2018. In addition we received an RMAT designation for lifileucel. Based on the meeting and subsequent dialog with the FDA we submitted and the FDA has approved the protocol for Cohort 4 of the C-144-01 trial. We began patient enrollment in Cohort 4 in early 2019. We expect to fully enroll the expected 75 patients into this cohort by late 2019 or early 2020. The primary endpoint is ORR as determined by BIRC.
 
Continue to improve our TIL manufacturing process and develop new TIL manufacturing technology to become the preferred provider of TIL therapy in the U.S. and the rest of the world.
 
We believe that we are the only company in the United States to have a centralized TIL manufacturing process and location. In 2018, we utilized our second generation TIL manufacturing process, known as Gen 2, which reduced TIL manufacturing time from 5-6 weeks to 22 days, allowing for a more commercially-viable product candidate. Gen 2 also produces a cryopreserved product for ease of administration and handling. The Gen 2 manufacturing process was utilized in completed Cohort 2 of our ongoing C-144-01 trial and will be used for Cohort 4 of this trial and has also been selected for use in most of our other ongoing TIL clinical development. We have included Gen 2 as the manufacturing process for registration for our discussions with the FDA and eventually the anticipated Biologics License Application, or BLA, filing for lifileucel. Our strategy is to establish our Gen 2 process as a commercial manufacturing process for TIL therapies, including lifileucel.
 
Collaborate with governmental, academic and corporate partners to improve and develop TIL and PBL therapies for new indications or for use in combination with other therapies, and to evaluate new manufacturing methods.
 
In addition to our own research and process development efforts, we seek to collaborate with government, academic research institutions, and corporate partners to improve TIL manufacturing and to develop TIL therapies for new indications. For example, in 2018, we announced new collaborations with RPCI, Cellectis, and Phio, as described in the following sections, and continued our collaborations with Moffitt, MDACC, and the Ohio State University, to evaluate several new solid tumor and hematologic indications for TIL and PBL therapy in clinical and preclinical studies as well as, in some cases, new TIL manufacturing approaches. In August 2016, we expanded our Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the NCI for another 5-year term. This collaboration with the NCI is directed at research on unmodified TIL therapy and also addresses human papilloma virus, or HPV-associated cancers (cervical and head and neck), lung, bladder, and breast cancer. A description of these collaborations and related agreements is provided in the following sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Continue to establish manufacturing capacity for TIL products.
 
We continue to invest in improving the process and efficiency of manufacturing our product candidates in the United States and Europe for TIL manufacturing. Currently we use several contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to supply our TIL-based products for our clinical trials under various MSAs. CMOs limit the amount of upfront capital investment.
 
We intend to begin construction of our own manufacturing facility in 2019, in order to provide for better margins and rapid implementation of innovative changes for TIL therapies that we may develop or commercialize. We intend to carefully manage our cost structure, and reduce the long-term cost of manufacturing our products, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our manufacturing costs to commercially attractive levels.
 
In October 2018, we entered into a three-year MSA and related statement of work with MaSTherCell S.A., a subsidiary of Orgenesis Inc., a cell therapy-dedicated Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization. Pursuant to the MSA, MaSTherCell agreed to provide manufacturing and other services for use in our European clinical trials.
 
In 2017, we entered into a three-year MSA and related statements of work with PharmaCell B.V., or PharmaCell, a contract manufacturing services company based in the Netherlands, to manufacture our autologous cell therapy products for use in our European clinical trials. PharmaCell was subsequently acquired by Lonza Group Ltd., or Lonza. Lonza manufactures TIL products for our European clinical trials in its clinical and commercial facility in Geleen, the Netherlands.
 
Also in 2017, we entered into a two-year MSA and related statements of work with Moffitt, to manufacture our autologous cell therapy products for use in clinical trials.
 
In 2016, we entered into a three-year MSA and related statements of work with WuXi AppTec, Inc., or WuXi, in order to increase our TIL manufacturing capacity in facilities with both clinical and commercial capability. We have extended the term of the MSA and related statements of work until May 2020. We intend to use WuXi as the initial manufacturer for commercial production of lifileucel.
 
Iovance-Sponsored Clinical Trials
 
We currently have five ongoing Phase 2 clinical studies. The ongoing studies include C-144-01, of our lead product candidate, lifileucel, for the treatment of metastatic melanoma; C-145-04, of our product candidate LN-145 for recurrent, metastatic or persistent cervical cancer; and C-145-03, of our product candidate LN-145, for recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. During 2018, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial, IOV-COM-202, a basket trial that will treat checkpoint naïve patients with TIL in combination with pembro for metastatic melanoma and head and neck cancer. The trial also includes a cohort that will treat relapsed and refractory NSCLC patients with TIL alone. Additional information about our clinical trials is presented as follows:

Lifileucel for Metastatic Melanoma
 
We are developing lifileucel to treat metastatic melanoma. Melanoma is a common type of skin cancer, accounting for approximately 91,000 patients diagnosed and 9,320 deaths each year in the United States according to the NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program, or SEER program, as of 2018. Our ongoing Phase 2 trial, C-144-01, is a prospective, registrational, four-cohort interventional study evaluating lifileucel in metastatic melanoma patients who have progressed after prior anti-PD-1 therapy and if BRAF mutant, after BRAF or BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy. Patients enrolled in this trial to date have failed several prior treatment regimens.
 
Patients with metastatic melanoma who have failed at least one treatment under the current standards of care have an unfavorable prognosis with very few curative treatment options. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, has updated its recommendations for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Initial therapy can include checkpoint inhibitors either alone or in combination (ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab), targeted therapies for patients with BRAF mutations (dabrafenib/trametinib, vemurafenib/cobimetinib combinations or single agents) or participating in a clinical trial. For patients not responding or progressing and who have an adequate clinical status, agents selected from the previous list or of a different therapeutic class can be used as well as high dose IL-2. NCCN experts also recommend participating in a clinical trial at any stage of disease. Patients who do not respond to the current second-line therapies have very few treatment options and typically have a very poor prognosis, with limited median survival measured in months. According to estimates from Decision Resource Group’s Disease Landscape and Forecast for Malignant Melanoma report, in the United States in 2018, approximately 4,950 melanoma patients are on their 3rd or 4th line of therapy and approximately 6,282 melanoma patients are on their 2nd line of therapy.
 
We are using our Gen 2 manufacturing process for all ongoing Phase 2 trials, and as a result, Cohort 1 of C-144-01, using our first generation or Gen 1 manufacturing process, was closed to enrollment in 2017 and subsequent patients were enrolled in Cohort 2. The planned enrollment in C-144-01 was reached in late 2018 and Cohort 2 is closed to enrollment. Cohort 3 is a retreatment cohort. In November 2018, we reported preliminary data from Cohort 2 of C-144-01 for 47 patients, who demonstrated an ORR of 38% with an initial DOR of 6.4 months and a range of 1.3+ to 14+ months. ORR was determined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1, or RECIST 1.1, as reported by each investigator. The ORR includes one complete response and 17 partial responses, one of which is unconfirmed because of the patient not having reached the follow-on assessment as of the end of 2018. Patients in the study had a mean of 3.3 prior systemic therapies and all the patients had received anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The safety findings for C-144-01 remain consistent with previous reports. The most common treatment emergent adverse events observed in this cohort to date include chills, febrile neutropenia, anemia, decreased platelet count, pyrexia, and hypophosphataemia. Two grade 5 treatment emergent adverse events have been observed to date. As additional patients are enrolled in the C-144-01 study, the safety profile of lifileucel may change.
 
We held an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, in September 2018 to discuss the C-144-01 study. In its written minutes to the meeting, the FDA acknowledged that conduct of a randomized Phase 3 study may not be feasible in its intended population of advanced melanoma patients, who have been treated with at least one systemic therapy including an anti-PD-1 antibody and if BRAF mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor or BRAF inhibitor with MEK inhibitor, and that a randomized study is not required for the registration of lifileucel. The FDA further acknowledged that a single-arm cohort of the C-144-01 trial may be acceptable for registration in this indication. A new cohort, Cohort 4, of 75 patients will be enrolled in C-144-01 with a prospective definition of the primary endpoint of ORR to be read out by a BIRC, to support registration of lifileucel. The FDA recommended that we validate a potency assay prior to starting Cohort 4, which we have done. We began enrolling patients in Cohort 4 in early 2019 in the United States and in Europe and expect it to be fully enrolled by late 2019 or early 2020. A BLA submission to the FDA including Cohort 4 results is expected in the second half of 2020.
 
LN-145 for Cervical Cancer
 
We are developing LN-145 to treat cervical cancer. According to estimates from the SEER program, approximately 13,000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer, and approximately 4,000 cervical cancer-related deaths occurred in the United States in 2018.
 
In August 2017, we enrolled our first patient in our ongoing Phase 2 trial, C-145-04, for the treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic or persistent cervical cancer who have failed one prior therapy. The trial met the initial efficacy threshold for the first stage of the Simon’s two stage design and continued to enroll patients to reach the full target sample size of 47 patients. The study is enrolling patients in the United States and Europe. Preliminary data for 15 patients yielded an ORR of 27%. While the median DOR was not reached at the time of that data report, the range of available data was from 2.4 to 2.5+ months. Patients in the study had a median of five prior therapies. The safety findings from this study remained consistent with previous reports. The most common treatment emergent adverse events observed to date included chills, pyrexia, anemia, hypotension, platelet count decrease, and vomiting. The protocol for this study has been amended to limit the number of prior therapies to 1-3 and to exclude patients who have been treated with prior immunotherapy, and to exclusively use Gen 2 TIL manufacturing process. We anticipate providing an update on this study at a medical conference in 2019. As additional patients are enrolled in the C-145-04 study, the safety profile of LN-145 may change.

LN-145 for Head and Neck Cancer
 
According to estimates from the SEER program, approximately 65,000 people were diagnosed with head- and neck-related cancers, and approximately 14,000 head- and neck- related cancer deaths occurred in the United States in 2018.
 
We are developing LN-145 to treat head and neck cancers. In June 2017, we enrolled our first patient in our ongoing Phase 2 trial, C-145-03, for the treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who have failed one prior therapy. The trial has met the initial efficacy threshold for the first stage of the Simon’s two stage design and will continue to enroll patients to the full target sample size of 47 patients. The trial is enrolling patients in the United States. We have amended the protocol so that newly enrolled patients will be treated using LN-145 produced from the Gen 2 manufacturing process. To date, preliminary data for 13 patients has yielded an ORR of 31%, with 4 partial responses, with the DOR ranging from 2.8 to 7.6 months. Patients in the study had a median of three prior therapies. The safety findings from this study are also consistent with previous reports. The protocol for this study has been amended to use Gen 2 TIL manufacturing. The most common treatment emergent adverse events observed to date include chills, hypotension, pyrexia, hyponatremia, and anemia. As additional patients are enrolled in the C-145-03 study, the safety profile of LN-145 may change.
 
LN-145 for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
 
We are developing LN-145 to treat NSCLC. According to estimates from the SEER program, approximately 234,000 people were diagnosed with lung and bronchus cancers, and approximately 154,000 deaths occurred related to these cancers in the United States in 2018.
 
Under our collaboration with MedImmune, we have initiated a two-cohort Phase 2 trial, IOV-LUN-201, in combination with durvalumab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced metastatic NSCLC. Patients in this study will be naïve to PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy. The study is expected to begin enrollment in 2019. The study will use Gen 2 TIL manufacturing process.
 
Investigator-Sponsored Clinical Trials
 
TIL in Other Solid Tumor Indications
 
We are collaborating with MDACC on clinical trials to evaluate TIL therapy in sarcomas, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. These trials, NCT03610490 and NCT03449108, began enrolling patients in 2018. Patients in these trials will be treated with LN-145 or TIL manufactured by MDACC.
 
We are collaborating with RPCI on a clinical trial to evaluate TIL therapy in bladder cancer. This trial is expected to begin enrolling patients in 2019. Patients in this trial will be treated with LN-145.
 
TIL in Combination with Other Immunotherapy Drugs
 
Checkpoint inhibitors are a class of immunotherapy drugs that seek to overcome one of cancer’s main defenses against an immune system attack. PD-1 is a checkpoint protein found on immune cells called T cells. It normally acts as a type of “off switch” that helps prevent T cells from attacking other cells in the body. It does this by attaching to PD-L1, a protein found on both normal and cancerous cells, which may then shut down an attack by a T cell. Some cancer cells have large amounts of PD-L1 expressed on their surfaces, which helps them evade T cell attack.
 
We are collaborating with Moffitt in study NCT03215810, which is currently enrolling patients to evaluate TIL therapy in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab in NSCLC. An additional clinical trial, NCT03374839, is being conducted by Moffitt to evaluate TIL therapy in combination with nivolumab in metastatic melanoma. We have also previously collaborated with Moffitt on a clinical trial, NCT01701674, to evaluate TIL therapy in combination with the CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab.
 
Under our CRADA, we are collaborating with the NCI in study NCT02621021 to evaluate TIL therapy in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in a 170-patient clinical trial in patients with advanced melanoma. This study is currently enrolling.
 
TIL Therapy Background
 
Immune system
 
The immune system recognizes danger signals and responds to threats at a cellular level. The most significant components of the cellular aspect of the adaptive immune response are T cells, or T lymphocytes, so called because they mature in the thymus and are distinguished from B cells which mature in the bone marrow. T cells can be distinguished from other white blood cells by T cell receptors present on their cell surface. These receptors contribute to tumor surveillance by helping T cells recognize infected cells as well as cancerous cells. T cells are involved in both sensing and killing infected or cancerous cells, as well as coordinating the activation of other cells in an immune response.
 
Cancer immunotherapy
 
Despite the progress that has been made over the past several decades, effective treatment of cancer, especially solid tumors, continues to be challenging. Some reasons solid tumors are so difficult to treat are: (i) in many solid tumors, multiple genes (as many as hundreds or thousands of genes) are mutated, and solid tumors are heterogeneous, (ii) it is not always clear which particular mutations are critical, and (iii) tumors can adapt and find a way to evade treatments that target a single mutation. In addition, the tumor can suppress the patient’s natural immune response. When T cells with cancer-specific receptors are absent, present in low numbers, of poor quality, or rendered inactive by suppressive mechanisms employed by tumor tissue, the cancer can grow and spread to various organs. In addition, standard of care treatments for cancer can be deleterious to T cells' ability to kill cancer.

We believe that adoptive cell therapy, with the use of human cells as therapeutic entities to reengage the immune system, may be a significant advancement in the treatment of cancer. These one-time cellular therapies may avoid the long-term side effects associated with current treatments and have the potential to be effective. We believe TIL therapy, in particular, has the potential to treat solid tumors by increasing the effectiveness and number of a patient's cancer-specific T cells. TIL therapy is polyclonal, and we believe that it is capable of targeting multiple tumor antigens on cancer cells. Furthermore, the non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy administered prior to TIL infusion is capable of suppressing the hostile tumor microenvironment, which we believe will enhance the efficacy of TIL therapy.
 
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
 
Adoptive cell therapy with TIL involves the following steps:
 

1. | Excision: After a surgical resection of a lesion, a patient’s TIL are removed from the tumor
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Extraction: Tumor is fragmented and placed in media for TIL to leave the tumor
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Expansion: TIL expanded exponentially ex vivo to yield 109 – 1011 TIL
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Preparation and Infusion: Patient receives non-myeloablative lymphodepletion to eliminate potentially suppressive tumor microenvironment and maximize engraftment and potential potency of TIL therapy; patient is infused with their expanded TIL and up to 6 doses of IL-2 to promote activation, proliferation and anti-tumor cytolytic activity of TIL
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Currently, our Gen 2 manufacturing process takes 22 days from receipt of the patient’s tumor at the manufacturing facility until shipping of the final TIL product to the institution for infusion of the TIL back into the patient. We currently treat patients with a single infusion of TIL, although our protocols allow for evaluation of more than one administration of TIL. After infusion, TIL can potentially infiltrate the tumor microenvironment to eliminate large numbers of cancer cells. TIL can also further proliferate in the body. TIL therapy can potentially overcome several mechanisms of tumor escape to which endogenous T cells may be susceptible due to the hostile tumor microenvironment.
 
Historical clinical results with TIL in metastatic melanoma 
 
To date, hundreds of metastatic melanoma patients have already been treated with TIL therapy produced locally using different manufacturing methods at different academic institutions and hospitals in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Israel. At NCI, clinical responses have been relatively consistent in several trials: over 50% of the melanoma patients treated with TIL have an objective response (i.e. tumor regression of 30% or more, as defined by RECIST criteria) and approximately 22-24% of patients have a complete response (tumor regression of 100%) with no evidence of disease remaining after only one administration. Most patients who have had a complete response remained in response in 3-7 years of follow up. Furthermore, patients can respond to TIL therapy regardless of their prior therapies.

In September 2015, Dr. Rosenberg, a recognized pioneer in immuno-oncology and adoptive cell therapy using TIL, presented updated findings from a Phase 2 clinical trial of TIL therapy in metastatic melanoma at the American Association for Cancer Research Inaugural International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference. Data was presented from a 101 patient, Phase 2 clinical trial conducted at the NCI. In the trial, patients with advanced metastatic melanoma were equally divided in two groups. Both groups were treated according to a standard TIL protocol using nonmyeloablative, or NMA, chemotherapy, with the second group also receiving total body irradiation. 54% of the patients treated with TIL therapy achieved an objective response. An objective response occurs when there is a complete remission or a partial remission of the tumor. Out of the 101 patients, 24, or 24%, had experienced a complete remission and 23 of the 24, or 96%, showed ongoing durability of this response at 30 to 47 months following treatment, at the time of publication. Median follow-up time was approximately 40.9 months. Overall survival, or OS, was approximately 80% at 12 months, and median OS had not yet been achieved. Median progression-free survival was approximately 8-10 months. This observation was also presented by Dr. Stephanie Goff at the 2016 ASCO meeting and published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in June 2016. At the ASCO 2018 meeting, Dr. Goff presented updated findings from the study. Patients that had prior anti PD-1 treatment had an ORR of 20-25%.

Clinical results with TIL in other solid tumor indications
 
Under our CRADA with the NCI, we are providing research, development and clinical funding for the development of unmodified TIL therapy for a variety of solid tumor indications, including HPV-associated cancers (cervical, head and neck), bladder, breast, and lung cancers. The NCI has an ongoing clinical trial involving TIL therapy to treat advanced HPV-positive cervical cancer. Data from this trial was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in April 2015 and in Science in April 2017 and was updated at the ASCO meeting in 2018. Out of 18 cervical cancer patients treated with HPV-TIL, two experienced complete remissions reported as ongoing at 53 and 67 months. Another three patients experienced a three-month partial response. Additionally, the NCI has ongoing trials to treat patients using TIL with colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma and lung cancer. Depending on results from the research and development and clinical trials conducted at the NCI under our CRADA, we may pursue the development and regulatory approval of TIL therapy for additional indications.
Safety
 
We continue to enroll patients in our ongoing TIL programs and we closely monitor our studies to learn about all safety events occurring, as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of these events may be associated with TIL therapy. To date, however, the largest set of data for TIL therapy was generated by the NCI as part of their multiple clinical studies. Per publications from the NCI, toxicities or adverse events during TIL therapy have been mostly associated with either the lymphodepletion regimen or the high-dose IL-2 therapy given after TIL infusion as described by Goff et al. in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in June 2016. The standard approach to the administration of high-dose IL-2 is to continue dosing until patients can no longer tolerate treatment. Our trials, however, have limited administration of IL-2 to up to 6 doses.

Next Generation TIL Product Strategies
 
We are developing next generation TIL products using owned and licensed intellectual property rights, in some cases in combination with collaborators such as Phio Pharmaceuticals and Cellectis, as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These products include both genetically-modified TIL and PD-1 selected TIL therapies. We are also developing PBL therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Process Development, Manufacturing, and Manufacturing Agreements
 
Our first generation TIL manufacturing process was based on the NCI’s original manufacturing and processing of TIL, which we modified so that it could be reproduced in a cGMP environment. This first-generation process expanded the number of TIL over a 5 to 6 week period and produced a non-cryopreserved product for administration to the patient. Our Gen 2 TIL manufacturing process, which was developed by our internal research and process development team, shortens the manufacturing process while allowing for a cryopreserved product. The Gen 2 process is currently in use in all of our trials in which we manufacture TIL products, including lifileucel and LN-145. We have selected Gen 2 for product registration and ongoing and future TIL clinical development, although we continue to develop new TIL manufacturing processes.
 
The Gen 2 manufacturing process begins with the collection of the patient’s tumor, which is then sent to a central manufacturing facility, where the T cells are isolated. These cells are stimulated to proliferate, then propagated in cell culture flasks until sufficient cells are available for infusion back into the patient. The TIL is then washed and put in media suitable for cryopreservation and infusion. The final product is shipped back to the clinical center where it can be administered to the patient. The following diagram illustrates our Gen 2 TIL manufacturing process.
 

We have entered into MSAs with WuXi, Moffitt, MaSTherCell, and PharmaCell, which was acquired by Lonza, pursuant to which they have agreed to manufacture, package, ship and handle quality assurance and quality control of certain clinical trials for our TIL products working closely with our employees. We have two suites for clinical manufacturing at WuXi, and one of those suites is also available to manufacture TIL for commercial use. Cell processing activities will be conducted at all companies under cGMP, using qualified equipment and materials. We believe that all materials and components utilized in the production of the final TIL product are readily available from qualified suppliers. We expect to rely on these CMOs, to meet anticipated clinical trial and if approved, commercial demands. In the future, we may rely on them or other third parties, or our own manufacturing capabilities for the manufacturing and processing of TIL-based product candidates for our clinical trials.
 
To meet projected needs for commercial sale quantities, we intend to build our own commercial manufacturing facility to supply and process products. Developing our own manufacturing capabilities may be costlier than we anticipate or result in significant delays. If we are unable to develop our own manufacturing capabilities, we may need to rely on CMOs, including both current and alternate suppliers, to ensure sufficient capacity is available for commercial purposes.

WuXi AppTec
 
In November 2016, the Company entered into a three-year manufacturing and services agreement, or MSA, with WuXi pursuant to which WuXi agreed to provide manufacturing and other services. Under the agreement, the Company entered into two statements of work for two cGMP manufacturing suites to be established and operated by WuXi for the Company, one of the suites is expected to be capable of being used for the commercial manufacture of our products. The statements of work for each facility include a fixed component to reserve a dedicated suite and a variable component, mainly labor and materials used during the manufacturing process. The Company and WuXi have extended the terms of the related statements of work until May 2020.


Personalized Patient Product Management
 
In September 2017, we entered into a partnership with TrakCel Ltd. to build a scheduling and logistics software tool that automates the supply chain for our TIL therapy products. The TrakCel software will electronically link us with our clinical sites, CMOs and couriers to schedule and track TIL therapies for each patient. The TrakCel software is also intended to help manage capacity utilization and throughput and will provide efficiencies in the delivery of TIL treatment.
 
The TrakCel software is also designed to ensure chain of identity for each patient’s product. Because our product candidates are specifically manufactured for each individual patient, we will be required to maintain a chain of identity with respect to the patient’s tumor as it moves from the patient to the manufacturing facility, through the manufacturing process, and back to the patient.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
During 2015, we received an orphan-drug designation for lifileucel in the United States to treat malignant melanoma stages IIB-IV. If approved, this designation provides seven years of market exclusivity in the United States, subject to certain limited exceptions. However, the orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
 
During 2018, we received an orphan drug designation from the FDA for L-145 for the treatment of cervical cancer with a tumor size of greater than 2 cm in diameter.
 
Fast Track Designation
 
In August 2017, we announced that the FDA had granted Fast Track designation for lifileucel for the treatment of advanced melanoma. The FDA’s Fast Track process is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Fast Track designation allows more frequent meetings and communications with the FDA to discuss the drug’s development plans and review process. The Fast Track designation also allows for the possibility a rolling review of a BLA by FDA.
Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation
 
In October 2018, we announced that the FDA had granted RMAT designation for lifileucel for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. The RMAT designation is based on data provided to the FDA from our C-144-01 study. RMAT designation is granted for regenerative medicine drugs and allows for increased access to FDA during development. Under this designation, surrogate endpoints can be used to receive approval for a product, accelerated approval may be granted, and a rolling review of a BLA may be permitted by FDA.
Commercialization Plan
 
We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities. We have limited personnel dedicated to commercialization. As we make progress towards registration of lifileucel, we plan to build sales and commercialization capabilities in support of commercialization of our products.
 
We have not yet decided on a commercial strategy for our TIL products. Our commercial strategy for markets outside the U.S. may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sales force or the establishment of our own commercial infrastructure. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval for one of our product candidates.
 
As additional product candidates advance through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. Clinical data, size of the development programs, size of the target market, size of a commercial infrastructure, intellectual property protection and manufacturing needs may all influence our U.S., Europe and rest-of-world strategies.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual property is of importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also plan to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, available regulatory exclusivities and patent term extensions where available. To achieve this objective, a strategic focus for us has been to develop our own intellectual property, while also identifying and licensing patents that provide protection and serve as an optimal platform to enhance our intellectual property and technology base.
 
We have engaged in the development of our own patent portfolio based on internal research and development activities in 2018. As a result, we now own a number of pending patent applications and granted patents in the fields of TIL therapy, marrow infiltrating lymphocyte or MIL therapy, PBL therapy, TIL, MIL, and PBL manufacturing processes, and TIL, MIL, and PBL expansion methods. Our patent portfolio includes two recently-granted U.S. patents related to our Gen 2 TIL manufacturing process. We expect to further develop our own patent portfolio as a strategic focus in 2019.

Research, Development and License Agreements
 
Currently, preclinical research and development is conducted primarily at our own internal research and development laboratory in Tampa, Florida, and additionally with the NCI, Moffitt, and MDACC, as described below. We also have preclinical collaborations with MDACC, RPCI, and Ohio State University. We sponsor our own clinical trials and also collaborate on investigator-sponsored clinical trials with the NCI, Moffitt, MDACC, and RPCI.
 
In addition, we hold exclusive, co-exclusive, and non-exclusive licenses to certain patent and other intellectual property rights with the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, an agency of the United States Public Health Service within the Department of Health and Human Services, Moffitt, MDACC, and PolyBioCept as described below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute
 
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement 
 
In August 2011, we signed a five-year CRADA with the NCI to work with Dr. Steven Rosenberg on developing adoptive cell immunotherapies that are designed to destroy metastatic melanoma cells using a patient’s tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.
 
In January 2015, we executed an amendment to the CRADA to include four new indications. As amended, in addition to metastatic melanoma, the CRADA included the development of TIL therapy for the treatment of patients with bladder, lung, triple-negative breast, and HPV-associated cancers.
 
In August 2016, the NCI and we entered into a second amendment to the CRADA. The principal changes effected by the second amendment included (i) extending the term of the CRADA by another five years to August 2021, and (ii) modifying the focus on the development of unmodified TIL as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with FDA-licensed products and commercially available reagents routinely used for adoptive cell therapy. The parties will continue the development of improved methods for the generation and selection of unmodified TIL with anti-tumor reactivity in metastatic melanoma, bladder, lung, breast, and HPV-associated cancers.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the CRADA, as amended, we are required to make quarterly payments of $0.5 million to the NCI for support of research activities. To the extent we license patent rights relating to TIL-based product candidates under this agreement, we will be responsible for all patent-related expenses and fees, past and future, relating to the TIL-based product candidate. In addition, we may be required to supply certain test articles, including TIL, grown and processed under cGMP conditions, suitable for use in clinical trials, where we hold the investigational new drug application for such clinical trial. The extended CRADA has a five-year term expiring in August 2021. Either party may unilaterally terminate the CRADA for any reason or for no reason at any time by providing written notice at least 60 days before the desired termination date.
 
Patent License Agreement Related to the Development and Manufacture of TIL
 
Effective October 5, 2011, we entered into a Patent License Agreement (“the Patent License Agreement”) with the NIH, which Patent License Agreement was subsequently amended on February 9, 2015 and October 2, 2015. Pursuant to the Patent License Agreement as amended, the NIH granted us licenses, including exclusive, co-exclusive, and non-exclusive licenses, to certain technologies relating to unmodified autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocyte adoptive cell therapy products for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, lung, breast, bladder and HPV-positive cancers. Unless terminated sooner, the license shall remain in effect until the last licensed patent right expires. The Patent License Agreement requires the Company to pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales (which percentage is in the mid-single digits), a percentage of revenues from sublicensing arrangements, and lump sum benchmark royalty payments on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones for each of the various indications and other direct costs incurred by the NIH pursuant to the agreement.
 
Exclusive Patent License Agreement Related to TIL Selection
 
On February 10, 2015, we entered into an Exclusive Patent License Agreement (the “Exclusive Patent License Agreement”) with the NIH under which we received an exclusive license to the NIH’s rights to patent-pending technologies related to methods for improving adoptive cell therapy through potentially more potent and efficient production of TIL from melanoma tumors by selecting for T-cell populations that express various inhibitory receptors. Unless terminated sooner, the license shall remain in effect until the last licensed patent right expires. Under the Exclusive Patent License Agreement, the Company agreed to pay customary royalties based on a percentage of net sales of a licensed product (which percentage is in the mid-single digits), a percentage of revenues from sublicensing arrangements, and lump sum benchmark payments upon the successful completion of clinical studies involving licensed technologies, the receipt of the first FDA approval or foreign equivalent for a licensed product or process resulting from the licensed technologies, the first commercial sale of a licensed product or process in the United States, and the first commercial sale of a licensed product or process in any foreign country.

H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center
 
Research Collaboration and Clinical Grant Agreements with Moffitt 
 
In December 2016, we entered into a new three-year sponsored research agreement, or SRA, with Moffitt. The SRA covers research aimed at better understanding TIL products and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of TIL.
 
We have entered into three clinical grant agreements with Moffitt involving investigator-sponsored trials. In June 2017, we entered into a clinical grant agreement with Moffitt to evaluate TIL therapy in a clinical trial that combines TIL with nivolumab in NSCLC. Dosing in this clinical trial began in late 2017. This Phase 1 study (NCT03215810) is designed to enroll up to 18 patients with advanced NSCLC. Initial results were reported at the 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer in September 2018. Under this clinical grant agreement, we obtained a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to any new Moffitt inventions made in the performance of the agreement. In December 2016, we entered into a clinical grant agreement with Moffitt under which we provide support for an ongoing clinical trial at Moffitt that combines TIL therapy with nivolumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. In July 2014, we entered into a clinical grant agreement with Moffitt under which we provided support for a clinical trial at Moffitt that combines TIL therapy with ipilimumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. Under all three clinical grant agreements with Moffit, we have non-exclusive rights to clinical data arising from the respective clinical trials.
 
Exclusive License Agreement with Moffitt
 
We entered into a license agreement with Moffitt, or the “First Moffitt License”, effective as of June 28, 2014, under which we received a world-wide license to Moffitt’s rights to patent-pending technologies related to methods for improving TIL for adoptive cell therapy using toll-like receptor agonists. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the license extends until the earlier of the expiration of the last issued patent related to the licensed technology or 20 years after the effective date of the license agreement.
 
Pursuant to the First Moffitt License, we paid an upfront licensing fee in the amount of $0.1 million. A patent issuance fee will also be payable under the First Moffitt License, upon the issuance of the first U.S. patent covering the subject technology. In addition, we agreed to pay milestone license fees upon completion of specified milestones, customary royalties based on a specified percentage of net sales (which percentage is in the low single digits) and sublicensing payments, as applicable, and annual minimum royalties beginning with the first sale of products based on the licensed technologies, which minimum royalties will be credited against the percentage royalty payments otherwise payable in that year. We will also be responsible for all costs associated with the preparation, filing, maintenance and prosecution of the patent applications and patents covered by the First Moffitt License related to the treatment of any cancers in the United States, Europe and Japan and in other countries designated by us in agreement with Moffitt.
 
PolyBioCept and Karolinska University Hospital
 
PolyBioCept Exclusive and Co-Exclusive License Agreement
 
On September 14, 2016, we entered into an exclusive and co-exclusive license Agreement, or the PolyBioCept Agreement, with PolyBioCept. PolyBioCept has filed two patent applications with claims related to a cytokine cocktail for use in expansion of lymphocytes, one of which has been abandoned. Under the PolyBioCept Agreement, we received the exclusive right and license to PolyBioCept’s intellectual property to develop, manufacture, market and genetically engineer TIL produced by expansion, selection and enrichment using a proprietary cytokine cocktail. We also received a co-exclusive license (with PolyBioCept) to develop, manufacture and market genetically engineered TIL under the same intellectual property. The licenses are for the use in all cancers and are worldwide in scope, with the exception that the uses in melanoma are not included for certain countries of the former Soviet Union. 
 
We paid PolyBioCept a total of $2.5 million as an upfront exclusive license payment. We will also have to make additional milestone payments to PolyBioCept under the PolyBioCept Agreement if, and when, (i) certain product development milestones are achieved, (ii) certain regulatory approvals have been obtained from the FDA and/or the European Medicines Agency, and (iii) certain product sales targets are achieved. The milestone payments will be payable both in cash (U.S. dollars) and in shares of our common stock. If all the foregoing product development, regulatory approval and sales milestone payments are met, we will have to pay PolyBioCept an additional $8.7 million and will have to issue to PolyBioCept a total 2,219,376 shares of unregistered common stock. In addition to these potential payments, we reimbursed PolyBioCept $0.2 million in expenses related to the transfer of know-how and paid PolyBioCept $0.1 million as a clinical trials management fee. The PolyBioCept Agreement has an initial term of 30 years and may be extended for additional five-year periods.
 
Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institute Agreements
 
In connection with the execution of the PolyBioCept Agreement, we also (i) entered into a clinical trials agreement with the Karolinska University Hospital to conduct clinical trials in glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer at the Karolinska University Hospital, and (ii) agreed to enter into a sponsored research agreement with the Karolinska Institute for the research of the cytokine cocktail in additional indications. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid Karolinska University Hospital $1.6 million to conduct these clinical trials. As of April 9, 2018, we terminated the clinical trials agreement with the Karolinska University Hospital. In June 2018, we received a refund of $1.6 million from Karolinska University Hospital, which resulted in a reversal of prior period expenses and a credit of $0.4 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.

M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
 
In April 2017, we entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement, or SAA, with MDACC under which we and MDACC agreed to conduct clinical and preclinical research studies. We agreed in the SAA to provide total funding not to exceed approximately $14.2 million for the performance of the multi-year studies under the SAA. In return, we will acquire all rights to inventions resulting from the studies and have been granted a non-exclusive, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and perpetual license to specified background intellectual property of MDACC reasonably necessary to exploit, including the commercialization thereof. We have also been granted certain rights in clinical data generated by MDACC outside of the clinical trials to be performed under the SAA. The SAA’s term shall continue in effect until the later of the fourth anniversary of the SAA or the completion or termination of the research and receipt of all deliverables due to us from M.D. Anderson thereunder. In May 2017, the Company made a prepayment of $1.4 million under this agreement.
Roswell Park Cancer Institute
 
In November 2018, we entered into an SAA with RPCI to conduct a clinical research study of TIL therapy in bladder cancer. The trial is being conducted and sponsored by RPCI and will use LN-145 manufactured by us. We plan to initiate dosing in this study in 2019. Previously, in July 2018, we entered into a Research Collaboration Agreement with Roswell Park Cancer Institute for a pre-clinical collaboration to explore the potential for TIL therapy in bladder and other cancers.
 
MedImmune
 
In December 2015, we entered into a collaboration agreement, which we refer to as the MedImmune Agreement, with MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca, to conduct clinical and preclinical research in immuno-oncology. Under the terms of the MedImmune Agreement, we will fund and conduct at least one clinical trial combining MedImmune's PD-L1 inhibitor, durvalumab, which will be supplied by MedImmune, with TIL product manufactured by us. In December 2017, under the MedImmune Agreement, we announced a Phase 2 multicenter clinical trial in NSCLC, IOV-LUN-201, to be sponsored by us. The protocol for this trial was amended in 2018 to enroll 12 anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 naïve NSCLC patients for treatment with durvalumab first, and if they fail to respond, for treatment with LN-145. This clinical trial is expected to begin enrolling patients in 2019.
 
Ohio State University
 
In September 2017, we entered into a preclinical research collaboration with the Ohio State University focused on TIL, MIL and PBL technologies. The collaboration focuses on hematologic malignancies in areas of poor prognostic cancer with high unmet need, which include AML and CLL.
Cellectis and Phio
 
In June 2018, we entered into a preclinical research collaboration with Cellectis S.A., or Cellectis, to investigate transcription activator-like effector nucleases, or TALEN, for genetic editing in conjunction with TIL therapy. In May 2018, we entered into a preclinical research collaboration with Phio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Phio, to investigate self-delivering ribonucleic acid interference methods for altering genetic expression in conjunction with TIL therapy.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries put significant resources in developing novel and proprietary therapies for the treatment of cancer. We compete with multiple entities who have developed and are developing immuno-oncology therapies, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, as well as companies developing novel targeted therapies for cancer. Universities and public and private research institutions in the U.S. and Europe are also potential competitors. For example, a Phase 3 study comparing TIL to standard ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma is currently being conducted in Europe by the Netherlands Cancer Institute, the Copenhagen University Hospital at Herlev, and the University of Manchester. While these universities and public and private research institutions primarily have educational objectives, they may develop proprietary technologies that lead to other FDA-approved therapies or that secure patent protection. We anticipate that we will face possibly increasing competition as new drugs and therapies enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
 
Due to the promising clinical therapeutic effect of their therapies in clinical exploratory trials, we anticipate substantial direct competition from other organizations developing advanced T-cell therapies targeting patients who have received prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. In particular, we expect to compete with other new therapies for our lead indications developed by companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Nektar Therapeutics, Idera Pharmaceuticals, Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Dynavax Technologies, Oncosec Medical, Immetacyte, WindMIL Therapeutics, and others. We also may compete with therapies based on genetically engineered T cells rendered reactive against tumor-associated antigens prior to their administration to patients. Genetically engineered T cells are being pursued by several companies, including Adaptimmune, Celgene (in collaboration with bluebird bio as well as through Celgene’s subsidiary Juno Therapeutics), Gilead Sciences, Novartis and others. To date, these technologies have been primarily applicable to hematologic malignancies, but their application in solid tumor indications may create competition with us.

Competition for late stage melanoma patients may come, if approved, from several compounds currently under development. NKTR-214, a pegylated version of IL-2, a CD122 agonist, under development by Nektar, in combination with nivolumab has reported 20 out of 38 stage 4 treatment naïve melanoma patients reported a partial or complete response. NKTR-214 activates cancer-fighting T cells and natural killer cells directly in the tumor, and it boosts PD-1 expression. At least two companies are combining novel agents, such as TLR9 agonists, with checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma indications. Idera Pharmaceuticals reported preliminary results from an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of the TLR9 agonist IMO-2125 in combination with ipilimumab indicating an ORR of 29% in 34 melanoma patients who had previously received anti-PD-1 therapy. Dynavax reported preliminary results from an ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial of the TLR9 agonist SD-101 in combination with pembrolizumab indicating an ORR of 21% in 29 patients who had received prior anti-PD-1 therapy.
 
While other types of cancer immunotherapies may potentially be used in combination with TIL, such as checkpoint inhibitors, to enhance efficacy, we also expect substantial direct competition from other types of immunotherapies. We face competition from immunotherapy treatments offered by companies such as Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, and Roche. Immunotherapy is also being pursued by several biotechnology companies as well as by large-cap pharmaceutical companies. We cannot predict whether other types of immunotherapies may be enhanced and show greater efficacy. As a result, we may have direct and substantial competition from such immunotherapies in the future.
 
Many potential competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect.
 
We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 
Government Regulations
 
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with our third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval and post-approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
Biologic products are regulated by the FDA under a combination of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and Public Health Services Act, or PHSA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in significant regulatory actions. Such actions may include refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, provision of corrective information, imposition of post-market requirements including the need for additional testing, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, FDA debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment from receiving government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, and adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences.

The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation, as well as manufacturing development and formulation studies; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 
· | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site or centrally, before the trial is begun; 
· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose; 
· | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA, after completion of pivotal clinical trial(s); 
· | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
· | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical sites to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs; and
· | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States, which must be updated periodically when changes are made. 

 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a new product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 
Human immunotherapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of immunotherapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA.
 
Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial or centrally must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, its informed consent form and any subject communications, before the clinical trial begins at that site, and upon amendment of the trial, and must monitor the study until completed. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits and whether the planned human subject protections are adequate. Informed consent must be received from each study subject prior to participation in a clinical study. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must also be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events or other significant safety information is found.
 
Regulatory authorities, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, that the trial is not being conducted in accordance with regulatory or IRB requirements, or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Sponsors may also discontinue studies or development programs for many reasons, including changing business objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, which provides recommendations and assessments for whether or not a study should move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. Following a review by a DSMB, the study may be halted if there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or on other grounds, such as failure to demonstrate efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. For instance, we are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in enforcement actions and adverse publicity.

For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. Although these are the typical phases for progression, and characteristics of the phases of a clinical development program, certain expedited programs allow for variations that could support a marketing application based on surrogate endpoints, intermediate clinical endpoints, or single-arm as opposed to comparative or placebo-controlled studies.
 

· | Phase 1 - The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Phase 2 - The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
· | Phase 3 - The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled studies to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Typically, two Phase 3 studies are required by the FDA for product approval.
· | Phase 4 - In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. 

 
Additional types of data may also help to support a BLA, such as real-world evidence and patient experience data. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and Phase 4 testing, if applicable, may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life and manufacturing processes must be validated.
 
The manufacture of investigational biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational biologics and active ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the importing country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FFDCA. Additional United States and foreign laws and regulations may also be applicable to the handling, import, export, and transportation of biological materials, including tissue samples.
 
During the development of a new therapeutic, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach an agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of product approval and an efficacy claim, as well as preclinical carcinogenicity trials and stability studies. An SPA may only be modified with the agreement of the FDA and the trial sponsor, or if the director of the FDA reviewing division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product was identified after the testing began. An SPA is intended to provide assurance that, in the case of clinical trials, if the agreed upon clinical trial protocol is followed, the clinical trial endpoints are achieved, and there is a favorable risk-benefit profile, the data may serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of a BLA. However, SPA agreements are not a guarantee of approval of a product candidate or any permissible claims about the product candidate. In particular, SPAs are not binding on the FDA if, among other reasons, previously unrecognized public health concerns arise during the performance of the clinical trial, other new scientific concerns regarding the product candidate’s safety or efficacy arise, or if the sponsoring company fails to comply with the agreed upon clinical trial protocol.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration, must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Also, under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, beginning in 2020, sponsors submitting applications for product candidates intended for the treatment of adult cancer which are directed at molecular targets that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of pediatric cancer must submit, with the application, reports from molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigations designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data, using appropriate formulations, to inform potential pediatric labeling. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Orphan products are also exempt from PREA requirements.

The FDA also may require submission of REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. An assessment of the REMS must also be conducted at set intervals. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the risks.
 
BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual program fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 
Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA has sixty days to determine whether it will accept the application for filing. The FDA accepts applications for filing if it determines that the application is substantially complete to permit a substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
 
The FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to a serious or life-threatening indication and, if approved, the product would provide a significant improvement in safety and efficacy, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing, which is referred to as Priority Review. The review process is often significantly extended if the FDA requests additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. There are numerous FDA personnel assigned to review different aspects of a BLA, and uncertainties can be presented by their ability to exercise judgment and discretion during the review process. The development and provision of additional data and information requested by FDA during review of a BLA may be time consuming and expensive.
 
The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a novel biologic, the FDA must either refer that biologic to an external advisory committee or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why the FDA did not refer the product candidate to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, which review, evaluate, and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP.
 
If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing, clinical studies, application modifications, or information in a complete response letter, or CRL. A CRL indicates that the review cycle for the application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either: resubmit the BLA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than an applicant interprets the same data.
 
If the FDA finds that a BLA is approvable, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. However, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety and efficacy after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may also not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing.

If compliance with the pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards are not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace, the FDA may also withdraw the product approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling, or FDA notification may be required.
 
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a Fast Track designation, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. Fast Track-designated products are also eligible for more frequent FDA interactions. A Fast Track-designated product candidate may also qualify for Rriority Review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority Review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for Priority Review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority Review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 
Under the Accelerated Approval Program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. To qualify for Accelerated Approval, the product must be intended to treat a serious condition and must generally provide a meaningful advantage over available therapies. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. If this trial is not conducted, if it fails to verify the benefit, if other evidence demonstrates that the product is not safe, pure or potent, or if the applicant disseminates false or misleading promotional material, the FDA may withdraw approval of the application on an expedited basis. Sponsors of products under the Accelerated Approval Pathway must further submit promotional materials to the FDA before dissemination.
 
In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established the new Breakthrough Therapy Designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a Breakthrough Therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a Breakthrough Therapy at the time of or any time after the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. If the FDA designates a Breakthrough Therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough Therapy designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis.
 
Recently, through the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, Congress also established another expedited program, called a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation. The Cures Act directs the FDA to facilitate an efficient development program for and expedite review of RMATs. To qualify for this program, the product must be a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or a combination of such products, and not a product solely regulated as a human cell and tissue product. The product must be intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that the product has the potential to address an unmet need for such disease or condition. Advantages of the RMAT designation include all the benefits of the Fast Track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with the FDA. These early interactions may be used to discuss potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints to support accelerated approval.
 
In August 2017, we announced that the FDA had granted Fast Track designation for lifileucel, for advanced metastatic melanoma. The Fast Track designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. In October 2018, we announced that lifileucel had received the RMAT designation for metastatic melanoma.
 
Orphan Drugs
 
During 2015, we received an orphan drug designation for lifileucel in the United States to treat malignant melanoma stages IIB-IV. We plan to seek orphan drug designation for some or all our other product candidates in specific orphan indications in which there is a medically plausible basis for the use of such products.

During 2018, we received an orphan-drug designation from the FDA for LN-145 for the treatment of cervical cancer with a tumor size of great than 2cm in diameter.
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan drug designation if there is a product already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same product as the already approved product. This hypothesis for clinical superiority must be demonstrated to obtain orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic, as sameness is defined in FDA’s regulations, for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research, opportunities for certain research grant funding, and a waiver of the BLA application fees. The tax credit, however, was recently limited through Congress’s tax reform efforts. Despite these benefits, the orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
 
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. The FDA may also approve a product deemed to be the same as an approved orphan product for the same orphan indication, despite periods of exclusivity, if the new product is demonstrated to be clinically superior to the former product.
 
Market and Data Exclusivity and Biosimilars
 
While the FDA may eventually license products, as further described below, that are biosimilar to any of our product candidates that are approved, our products may receive periods of regulatory exclusivity, in addition to orphan drug exclusivity for those products with orphan drug designations, providing additional protection from certain forms of competition. For instance, our products may receive 12 years of reference product exclusivity that begins running at the time of first licensure. During this time, the FDA may not make an approval of a biosimilar product effective and may not accept a biosimilar application for four years from the date of licensure. However, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the exclusivity period. The PHSA also includes provisions to protect reference products that have patent protection. The biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may, but are not required to, exchange certain patent and product information for the purpose of determining whether there should be a legal patent challenge. Based on the outcome of negotiations surrounding the exchanged information, the reference product sponsor may bring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings against the biosimilar product sponsor. The biosimilar applicant may also be able to bring an action for declaratory judgment concerning the patent.
 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Accordingly, if we receive FDA licensure, we may face competition from biosimilar products. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires a high similarity to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical trial, absent a waiver by the FDA. There must be no difference between the reference product and a biosimilar in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 
Pediatric Exclusivity and Patent Term Extension
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA, whatever regulatory periods of exclusivity that already cover the product are extended by six months.

If approved, biologics may also be eligible for periods of U.S. patent term restoration. If granted, patent term restoration extends the patent life of a single unexpired patent that has not previously been extended, for a maximum of five years. The total patent life of the product with the extension also cannot exceed fourteen years from the product’s approval date. Subject to the prior limitations, the period of the extension is calculated by adding half of the time from the effective date of an IND to the initial submission of a marketing application, and all the time between the submission of the marketing application and its approval. This period may also be reduced by any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence. Whether any of our product candidates will be eligible for patent term restoration is currently unknown. Even if any of our product candidates are found to be eligible for patent term protection, the applicable authorities may subsequently determine that we are not eligible for such restoration periods.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product and deviations, annual reporting and monitoring and providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, certain electronic records and signatures, fulfilling post-marketing study and REMS commitments, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label use, if they deem such use to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Recent court decisions have impacted FDA’s enforcement activity regarding off-label promotion in light of First Amendment considerations; however, there are still significant risks in this area, in part due to the potential for False Claims Act exposure.
 
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies that list their products, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, withdrawal of approval, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
The Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, imposes obligations on manufacturers of prescription biopharmaceutical products for commercial distribution, regulating the distribution of the products at the federal level, and sets certain standards for federal or state registration and compliance of entities in the supply chain, including manufacturers and repackagers, wholesale distributors, third-party logistics providers, and dispensers. The DSCSA preempts previously enacted state laws and the pedigree requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA. Trading partners within the drug supply chain must now ensure certain product tracing requirements are met that they are doing business with other authorized trading partners; and they are required to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statements. Further, the DSCSA limits the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products and imposes requirements to ensure overall accountability and security in the drug supply chain. As of November 27, 2018, product identifier information, an aspect of the product tracing scheme, is required.
 
As previously mentioned, the FDA may also require Phase 4 testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 
Additional Biologic Requirements
 
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.

After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA, together with a release protocol showing the results of all the manufacturer's tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer.
 
In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. After approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
Our sales, promotion, medical education and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States, and in addition to the FDA, these entities may include the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the False Claims Act, or FCA, the Veterans Health Care Act, physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional state laws similar to the foregoing.
 
The federal AKS prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs, in whole or in part. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The federal AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the federal AKS was amended by the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which is collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. On January 31, 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a proposed rule aimed at eliminating certain AKS safe harbor protections for drug rebates.
 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
The FCA imposes liability on persons who, among other things, knowingly present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by the federal government knowingly making or using, or causing to be made or used a false statement or record material to a claim to the federal government, or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The civil FCA has been or can be used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price and Average Manufacturer Price, improper promotion of uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug’s label, false statements associated with government grants, and allegations of misrepresentations with respect to services rendered, as well as claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. FCA claims may be based on noncompliance with regulatory requirements under an implied certification theory if material to the government’s decision to buy or pay for a drug. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil FCA. Civil FCA liability may also be imposed for Medicare or Medicaid overpayments caused by understated rebate amounts that are not refunded within 60 days of discovering the overpayment, even if the overpayment was not caused by a false or fraudulent act. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the government or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. If the government intervenes in a qui tam action, and prevails, the qui tam plaintiff will share in the proceeds from damages and fines or settlement funds. If the government declines to intervene, the qui tam plaintiff may pursue the case alone. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The government may further prosecute conduct under the criminal FCA, which prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing the claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent. Unlike the civil FCA, conviction requires proof of intent to submit a false claim.

Additionally, the FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making, offering or authorizing improper payments or other items of value, directly or indirectly, to foreign officials, political parties, or candidates for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
 
Payment or reimbursement of prescription drugs by Medicaid or Medicare requires manufacturers of the drugs to submit pricing information to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. The Medicaid Drug Rebate statute requires manufacturers to calculate and report price points, which are used to determine Medicaid rebate payments shared between the states and the federal government and Medicaid payment rates for the drug. For drugs paid under Medicare Part B, manufacturers must also calculate and report their Average Sales Price or ASP, which is used to determine the Medicare Part B payment rate for the drug. Drugs that are approved under a Biologic License Application, or BLA, or an NDA, including 505(b)(2) drugs, are subject to an additional inflation penalty which can substantially increase rebate payments. In addition, for BLA and NDA drugs, the Veterans Health Care Act, or VHCA, requires manufacturers to calculate and report to the Veterans Administration, or VA, a different price called the Non-Federal Average Manufacturing Price, which is used to determine the maximum price that can be charged to certain federal agencies, referred to as the Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP. Like the Medicaid rebate amount, the FCP includes an inflation penalty. A Department of Defense regulation requires manufacturers to provide this discount on drugs dispensed by retail pharmacies when paid by the TRICARE Program. All these price reporting requirements create risk of submitting false information to the government, and potential FCA liability.
 
The VHCA also requires manufacturers of covered drugs participating in the Medicaid program to enter into Federal Supply Schedule contracts with the VA through which their covered drugs must be sold to certain federal agencies at FCP and to report pricing information. This necessitates compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations and subjects us to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions. In addition, the VHCA requires manufacturers participating in Medicaid to agree to provide different mandatory discounts to certain Public Health Service grantees and other safety net hospitals and clinics.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters. The ACA amended the intent requirement of certain of these criminal statutes under HIPAA so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation.
 
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of, or provide services to, a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.
 
Even for entities that are not deemed “covered entities” or “business associates” under HIPAA, according to the United States Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 USC § 45(a). The FTC expects a company's data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC's guidance for appropriately securing consumers' personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.
 
Payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers, and other financial interests, have been the subject of a range of federal and state laws. The federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, was created under the ACA. The Sunshine Act, among other things, imposes reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, other healthcare providers, and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an additional aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures,” for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Beginning in 2021, the reporting and transparency requirements for physicians will extend to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level healthcare professionals, requiring the reporting of payments and transfers made in that same calendar year. Additionally, certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.

Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and in some cases may apply regardless of payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report pricing and marketing information, including, among other things, information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information and the use of prescriber-identifiable data in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil, administrative, and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, injunctions, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs at the federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third party payors decide which drugs they will pay for on behalf of their beneficiaries and establish reimbursement levels for health care. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, with a recent focus on prioritization of “equivalent,” less expensive alternatives when available. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved, especially for product candidates such as ours, which are used in the inpatient setting, usually resulting in no separate reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. There are additional pressures on pricing as a result of other, peripheral policies impacting reimbursement across both government and private payors. Non-health specific policies may impart downstream impacts on private insurance reimbursement decision-making. In consideration of these numerous factors, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
 
Medicare is a federally-funded program managed by CMS through local contractors that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled. Medicare Part A covers inpatient hospitalization and Medicare Part B covers outpatient medical services. Medicare coverage of drugs and biological products and payment rates to providers are established by federal law and regulations. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of low income patients who are otherwise uninsured and is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and requires rebates on outpatient drugs and biological products, including those administered by physicians if the cost is billed separately. Each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program, including supplemental rebate programs that prioritize coverage for drugs on the state Preferred Drug List. Government laws and regulations also establish price controls on prescription drugs purchased by government agencies that provide health care and certain federally funded hospital outpatient departments and clinics. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such products and services. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. In addition, government programs like Medicaid include substantial penalties for increasing commercial prices over the rate of inflation which can affect realization and return on investment. Further, some stakeholders have recently questioned whether the market price of prescription drugs may be inflated by virtue of the built-in cost imparted by the government rebate model, often negotiated indirectly in exchange for a coverage determination or formulary placement where relevant.
 
In the United States, the European Union, and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and private third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Manufacturers frequently must rebate a portion of the prescription price to the third-party payors as a condition of coverage, which can greatly reduce realization on the sale. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. They may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication, or they may control costs, particularly for new expensive therapies, by requiring prior authorization or imposing other restrictions before covering certain products, or they may condition payment based on achieving performance metrics. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage.

Achieving favorable CMS coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product, because Medicare and Medicaid can represent a sizeable share of the market and because private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will likely put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement, and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, competition within therapeutic classes, availability of generic equivalents, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid, and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies, and pricing in general. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, and other third-party payors.
 
As a result of the above, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to ensure acceptance and use of our products and product candidates or enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Legislative and regulatory proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major federal and state legislative initiatives.
 
In addition, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013, which will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In 2017, CMS promulgated a rule reducing Medicare Part B reimbursement to hospitals for drugs purchased under the 340B program by 30%. Although hospital trade associations filed a lawsuit challenging the regulation, the final rule is now in effect. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
 
Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.
 
The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest and states have begun to take action to increase transparency in drug pricing through mandatory reporting requirements. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably.

Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
In the EU, member states require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial. Under the EU regulatory systems, marketing authorization applications may be submitted under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. It is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes. Because our products are produced in that way, we would be subject to the centralized process. Under the centralized procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency. Once granted by the European Commission, a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states, as well as the European Economic Area countries. By law, a company can only start to market a medicine once it has received a marketing authorization.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 88 employees, 67 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 21 of whom were engaged in general and administrative support activities. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key scientific, technical and senior management personnel.
