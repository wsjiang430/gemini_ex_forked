Merger 
 
Effective April 30, 2018, the Company completed its merger with First West Virginia Bancorp (“FWVB”), the holding company for Progressive Bank, N.A. (“PB”), a national association. Through the merger, the Company anticipates future revenue and earnings growth from an expanded menu of financial services expanding the Company’s business footprint into the Ohio Valley. The merger added eight branches and expanded the Company’s reach into West Virginia with seven branches and one branch in Eastern Ohio. In connection with the merger, the Company issued approximately 1,317,647 shares of common stock and paid cash consideration of $9.8 million. The merger value is approximately $51.3 million.
 
The merger was accounted for as an acquisition in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting as detailed in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, Business Combinations. The acquisition method of accounting requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the date of acquisition. This process is heavily reliant on measuring and estimating the fair values of all the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity. To the extent we do not have the requisite expertise to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we engaged third-party valuation specialists to assist us in determining such values.
 
Market Area
 
The Company’s southwestern Pennsylvania market area consists of Greene, Allegheny, Washington, Fayette and Westmoreland Counties in southwestern Pennsylvania. Our branches located in Allegheny, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland Counties are in the southern suburban area of metropolitan Pittsburgh. Our acquired branches from the FWVB merger extend the Company’s market area into West Virginia with seven branch locations in Brooke, Marshall, Ohio, Upshur and Wetzel Counties; and one branch location in Belmont County in Ohio. The area has been impacted by the energy industry through the extraction of untapped natural gas reserves in the Marcellus Shale Formation. The Marcellus Shale Formation extends throughout much of the Appalachian Basin and most of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Eastern Ohio and is located near high-demand markets along the east coast. The proximity to these markets makes it an attractive target for energy development and has resulted in significant job creation through the development of gas wells and transportation of gas. Greene County is a significantly more rural county compared to the counties in which we have our other branches.
 
Based on data published by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry, the estimated populations of Allegheny, Greene, Washington, Fayette and Westmoreland Counties are approximately 1.2 million, 38,000, 208,000, 134,000 and 355,000, respectively. The December 2018 unemployment rates for Allegheny, Greene, Washington, Fayette and Westmoreland Counties were 3.7%, 4.3%, 3.8%, 5.3% and 3.9%, respectively, compared to a state-wide average of 3.9%. The average annual wage as of the second quarter of 2018 (the latest data available) in Allegheny, Greene, Washington, Fayette and Westmoreland Counties were $59,000, $53,000, $53,000, $39,000, and $44,000, respectively, compared to $54,000 statewide.
 
Data for our West Virginia and Ohio branch locations was obtained from the Federal Department of Labor and Statistics. The estimated populations of Brooke, Marshall, Ohio, Upshur and Wetzel Counties in West Virginia and Belmont County in Ohio are approximately 23,000, 32,000, 43,000, 25,000, 16,000 and 69,000, respectively. The December 2018 unemployment rates for Brooke, Marshall, Ohio, Upshur and Wetzel Counties in West Virginia and Belmont County in Ohio are 5.2%, 5.0%, 3.9%, 5.2%, 5.2% and 5.1%, respectively, compared to West Virginia and Ohio state-wide averages of 4.7% and 4.4%, respectively. The average annual wage as of the second quarter of 2018 (the latest data available) in Brooke, Marshall, Ohio, Upshur and Wetzel Counties in West Virginia and Belmont County in Ohio were $42,000, $66,000, $43,000, $39,000, $35,000 and $40,000, respectively, compared to West Virginia and Ohio statewide averages of $45,000 and $49,000, respectively.
 
Competition
 
We encounter significant competition both in attracting deposits and in originating real estate and other loans. Our most direct competition for deposits historically has come from other commercial banks, savings banks, savings associations and credit unions in our market area, and we expect continued strong competition from such financial institutions in the foreseeable future. The Company faces additional competition for deposits from online financial institutions and non-depository competitors, such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms, and insurance companies. We compete for deposits by offering depositors a high level of personal service and expertise together with a wide range of financial services. Our deposit sources are primarily concentrated in the communities surrounding our banking offices located in Greene, Allegheny, Washington, Fayette and Westmoreland Counties in southwestern Pennsylvania; Brooke, Marshall, Ohio, Upshur and Wetzel Counties in West Virginia; and Belmont County in Ohio. As of June 30, 2018, our FDIC-insured deposit market share in the counties we serve out of 59 bank and thrift institutions with offices in Greene, Allegheny, Washington, Fayette and Westmoreland Counties in Pennsylvania; Brooke, Marshall, Ohio, Upshur and Wetzel Counties in West Virginia; and Belmont County in Ohio was 0.76%. Such data does not reflect deposits held by credit unions.

The competition for real estate and other loans comes principally from other commercial banks, mortgage banking companies, government-sponsored entities, savings banks and savings associations. This competition for loans has increased substantially in recent years. We compete for loans primarily through the interest rates and loan fees we charge and the efficiency and quality of services we provide to borrowers and home builders. Factors that affect competition include general and local economic conditions, current interest rate levels and the volatility of the mortgage markets.
 
Lending Activities
 
General. Historically, our principal lending activity has been the origination of residential loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties in our local market area and commercial real estate, construction, commercial and industrial, and consumer loans. At December 31, 2018, our net loans receivable totaled $903.3 million compared to $735.6 million at December 31, 2017. Our overall net loan growth was $167.7 million primarily the result of the FWVB merger and late 2017 efforts to deploy increasing deposit funds. Commercial real estate loans increased $78.1 million primarily due to a concerted effort to increase our market share with deploying FWVB acquired deposits into the lending market. Residential real estate loans increased $51.5 million and Construction loans increased $12.7 million primarily due to retaining mortgage loans as a result of rising interest rates which lead to a decline in sold mortgage loans and the origination of construction projects.

Residential Real Estate Loans. Residential real estate loans are comprised of loans secured by one- to four-family residential and, to a lesser extent, multifamily properties. Included in residential real estate loans are traditional one- to four-family mortgage loans, multifamily mortgage loans, home equity installment loans, and home equity lines of credit. We generate loans through our marketing efforts, existing customers and referrals, real estate brokers, builders and local businesses. At December 31, 2018, $325.0 million, or 35.6% of our total loan portfolio, was invested in residential loans.
 
One- to Four-Family Mortgage Loans. Historically our primary lending activity has been the origination of fixed-rate, one- to four-family, owner-occupied, residential mortgage loans with terms up to 30 years secured by property located in our market area. At December 31, 2018, one- to four-family mortgage loans totaled $216.2 million. Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are generally conforming loans, underwritten according to secondary market guidelines. We generally originate fixed-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which is generally $453,100 for single-family homes, except in certain high-cost areas in the United States. At December 31, 2018, we had 30 one- to four-family residential mortgage loans totaling $22.2 million with principal balances in excess of $453,100, commonly referred to as jumbo loans. Our fixed-rate mortgage loans amortize monthly with principal and interest due each month. These loans often remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms because borrowers may refinance or prepay loans at their option without a prepayment penalty.

When underwriting one- to four-family mortgage loans, we review and verify each loan applicant’s income and credit history. Management believes that stability of income and past credit history are integral parts in the underwriting process. Written appraisals are generally required on real estate property offered to secure an applicant’s loan. We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans to 80% of the purchase price or appraised value of the property, whichever is less. For one- to four-family real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios of over 80%, we generally require private mortgage insurance. We require fire and casualty insurance on all properties securing real estate loans. We require title insurance, or an attorney’s title opinion, as circumstances warrant.
 
Our one- to four-family mortgage loans customarily include due-on-sale clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the underlying real property serving as collateral for the loan.
 
Fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with terms of 15 years or more are originated for resale to the secondary market. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we originated $10.3 and $19.8 million of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, respectively, which were subsequently sold in the secondary mortgage market.
 
The origination of fixed-rate mortgage loans versus adjustable-rate mortgage loans is monitored on an ongoing basis and is affected significantly by the level of market interest rates, customer preference, our interest rate risk position and our competitors’ loan products. We currently do not offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans, but in the past offered them for terms ranging up to 30 years. We did acquire adjustable-rate mortgage loans in the FWVB merger. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate totaled $27.8 million at December 31, 2018. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans make our loan portfolio more interest rate sensitive. However, as the interest income earned on adjustable-rate mortgage loans varies with prevailing interest rates, such loans do not offer predictable cash flows in the same manner as long-term, fixed-rate loans. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans carry increased credit risk associated with potentially higher monthly payments by borrowers as general market interest rates increase. It is possible that during periods of rising interest rates that the risk of delinquencies and defaults on adjustable-rate mortgage loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest costs to the borrower, resulting in increased loan losses.
 
We do not offer an “interest only” mortgage loan product on one- to four-family residential properties (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer a “subprime loan” program (loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (traditionally defined as loans having less than full documentation). We may originate loans to consumers with a credit score below 660. This may be defined as subprime loans, however there are typically mitigating circumstances that according to FDIC guidance and our opinion would not designate such loans as “subprime.”
 
Home Equity Loans. At December 31, 2018, home equity loans totaled $108.8 million. Our home equity loans and lines of credit are generally secured by the borrower’s principal residence. The maximum amount of a home equity loan or line of credit is generally 85% of the appraised value of a borrower’s real estate collateral less the amount of any prior mortgages or related liabilities. Home equity loans and lines of credit are approved with both fixed and adjustable interest rates, which we determine based upon market conditions. Such loans are fully amortized over the life of the loan. Generally, the maximum term for home equity loans is 15 years.
 
Our underwriting standards for home equity loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally from any verifiable secondary income. We also consider the length of employment with the borrower’s present employer. Creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration; however, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount.
 
Home equity loans entail greater risks than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, which are secured by first lien mortgages. In such cases, collateral repossessed after a default may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of damage or depreciation in the value of the property or loss of equity to the first lien position. Further, home equity loan payments are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Finally, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans in the event of a default.

Commercial Real Estate Loans. We originate commercial real estate loans that are secured primarily by improved properties, such as retail facilities, office buildings and other non-residential buildings. At December 31, 2018, $287.1 million, or 31.5% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial real estate loans.
 
Our commercial real estate loans generally have terms of up to 15 years and have adjustable interest rates. The adjustable rate loans are typically fixed for the first five years and adjust every five years thereafter. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate loans is generally 75% to 80% of the lower of cost or appraised value of the property securing the loan.
 
We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including project-level and global cash flows and debt service coverage, credit history and management expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property, securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with Community Bank and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors considered include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the property. We generally will not lend to High Volatility Commercial Real Estate (HVCRE) projects. All commercial real estate loans are appraised by outside independent state certified general appraisers. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial real estate loan borrowers, although this requirement may be waived in limited circumstances depending upon the loan-to-value ratio and the debt-service ratio associated with the loan. Community Bank requires property and casualty insurance and flood insurance if the property is in a flood zone area.
 
We underwrite commercial real estate loan participations to the same standards as loans originated by us. In addition, we consider the financial strength and reputation of the lead lender. We require the lead lender to provide a full closing package as well as annual financial statements for the borrower and related entities so that we can conduct an annual loan review for all loan participations. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the successful operation or management of the properties securing the loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related business and real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.
 
Construction Loans. We originate construction loans to individuals to finance the construction of residential dwellings and also originate loans for the construction of commercial properties, including hotels, apartment buildings, housing developments, and owner-occupied properties used for businesses. At December 31, 2018, $48.8 million, or 5.3% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of construction loans. Our construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually 12 to 18 months. At the end of the construction phase, the loan generally converts to a permanent residential or commercial mortgage loan. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% on both residential and commercial construction. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require a pro forma appraisal of the property, as completed by an independent licensed appraiser. We also will require an inspection of the property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. We typically do not lend to developers unless they maintain a 15% cash equity position in the project.
Commercial and Industrial Loans. We originate commercial and industrial loans and lines of credit to borrowers located in our market area that are generally secured by collateral other than real estate, such as equipment, inventory, and other business assets. At December 31, 2018, $113.2 million, or 12.4% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial and industrial loans. The loans generally have terms of maturity from five to seven years with adjustable interest rates tied to the prime rate LIBOR or the weekly average of the FHLB of Pittsburgh three to ten year fixed rates. We generally obtain personal guarantees from the borrower or a third party as a condition to originating the loan. On a limited basis, we will originate unsecured business loans in those instances where the applicant’s financial strength and creditworthiness has been established. Commercial business loans generally bear higher interest rates than residential loans, but they also may involve a higher risk of default because their repayment is generally dependent on the successful operation of the borrower’s business.
 
Our underwriting standards for commercial business loans include a determination of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan from normal cash flows generated in the applicant’s business. We assess the financial strength of each applicant through the review of financial statements and tax returns provided by the applicant. The creditworthiness of an applicant is derived from a review of credit reports as well as a search of public records. We periodically review business loans following origination. We request financial statements at least annually and review them for substantial deviations or changes that might affect repayment of the loan. Our loan officers may also visit the premises of borrowers to observe the business premises, facilities, and personnel and to inspect the pledged collateral. Underwriting standards for business loans are different for each type of loan depending on the financial strength of the applicant and the value of collateral offered as security. All commercial loans are assigned a risk rating. These ratings are reviewed annually by the independent loan review professionals.

Consumer Loans. We originate consumer loans that primarily consist of indirect auto loans and, to a lesser extent, secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit. As of December 31, 2018, consumer loans totaled $122.2 million, or 13.4%, of our total loan portfolio, of which $111.5 million were indirect auto loans. Consumer loans are generally offered on a fixed-rate basis. Our underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally from any verifiable secondary income. We also consider the length of employment with the borrower’s present employer as well as the amount of time the borrower has lived in the local area. Creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration; however, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount.
 
Indirect auto loans are loans that are sold by auto dealerships to third parties, such as banks or other types of lenders. We work with various auto dealers throughout our lending area. The dealer collects information from the applicant and transmits it to us electronically for review, where we can either accept or reject applicants without ever meeting them. If the Bank approves the applicant’s request for financing, the Bank purchases the dealership-originated installment sales contract and is known as the holder in due course that is entitled to receive principal and interest payments from a borrower. As compensation for generating the loan, a portion of the rate is advanced to the dealer and accrued in a prepaid dealer reserve account. As a result, the Bank’s yield is below the interest rate because the Bank must wait for the stream of loan payments to be repaid. The Bank will receive a pro rata refund of the amount prepaid to the dealer only if the loan prepays within the first six months or if the collateral for the loan is repossessed. The Bank is responsible for pursuing repossession if the borrower defaults on payments.
 
Consumer loans entail greater risks than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, particularly consumer loans secured by rapidly depreciating assets, such as automobiles, or loans that are unsecured. In such cases, collateral repossessed after a default may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of damage, loss or depreciation. Further, consumer loan payments are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Such events would increase our risk of loss on unsecured loans. Finally, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans in the event of a default.

Loan Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The following table summarizes the scheduled repayments of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. Demand loans, loans having no stated repayment schedule or maturity, and overdraft loans are reported as being due in one year or less. Consumer loans consist primarily of indirect automobile loans whereby a portion of the rate is prepaid to the dealer and accrued in a prepaid dealer reserve account. Thus the true yield for the portfolio is significantly less than the note rate disclosed below.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 
 
Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the board of directors. In the approval process for residential loans, we assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the value of the property securing the loan. To assess the borrower’s ability to repay, we review the borrower’s income and expenses and employment and credit history. In the case of commercial real estate loans, we also review projected income, expenses and the viability of the project being financed. We generally require appraisals of all real property securing loans. Appraisals are performed by independent licensed appraisers. Community Bank’s loan approval policies and limits are also established by its board of directors. All loans originated by Community Bank are subject to its underwriting guidelines. Loan approval authorities vary based on loan size in the aggregate. Individual officer loan approval authority generally applies to loans of up to $1 million. Loans above that amount and up to $2 million may be approved by the Loan Committee. Loans between $2 million and $5 million may be approved by the Discount Committee, which includes five directors of the Bank. Loans in the aggregate over $5 million must be approved by the board of directors.
Delinquencies and Classified Assets 
 
When a borrower fails to remit a required loan payment, a courtesy notice is sent to the borrower prior to the end of their appropriate grace period stressing the importance of paying the loan current. If a payment is not paid within the appropriate grace period, then a late notice is mailed. In addition, telephone calls are made and additional letters may be sent. For loans that are secured by real estate that become 30 days delinquent, an Act 6 Notice of Intention to Foreclose will be mailed stating to the borrower that they have 30 days to cure the default. In the event that the default is not cured by the 30th day then an Act 91 Notice of Foreclosure is mailed stating to the customer that they have 33 days to cure the default for Pennsylvania mortgages. Once the loan has become 90 or more days delinquent then it is forwarded to the Bank’s attorney to pursue other remedies or to file a mortgage foreclosure complaint. In the event that all collection efforts have not succeeded, then the property will proceed to a Sheriff Sale to be sold. Collection efforts continue on all loans until it is determined by the Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, and the Collection Department Manager that the debt is uncollectable. For commercial loans, the borrower is contacted in an attempt to reestablish the loan to current payment status and ensure timely payments continue. Collection efforts continue until the loan is 60 days past due, at which time demand payment, default, and/or foreclosure procedures are initiated. We may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under certain circumstances.

Nonperforming Assets and Delinquent Loans. The Company reviews its loans on a regular basis and generally places loans on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. In addition, the Company places loans on nonaccrual status when we do not expect to receive full payment of interest or principal. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed from interest income. Loans that are 90 days or more past due may still accrue interest if they are well secured and in the process of collection. Once a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the borrower must generally demonstrate at least six consecutive months of payment performance before the loan is eligible to return to accrual status.
 
Management monitors all past due loans and nonperforming assets. Such loans are placed under close supervision, with consideration given to the need for additions to the allowance for loan losses and (if appropriate) partial or full charge-off. At December 31, 2018, we had $327,000 of loans 90 days or more past due that were still accruing interest. Nonperforming assets decreased $347,000 to $7.2 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $7.6 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in the level of nonperforming assets was primarily due to the charge-off of three commercial and industrial relationships in the first quarter of 2018. In addition, troubled debt restructured commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans had loan payoffs and loan paydowns during the current year. This was partially offset by a commercial and industrial loan that entered into a TDR transaction that termed out the line of credit with a balloon payment at the loan maturity date.
 
Management believes the volume of nonperforming assets can be partially attributed to unique borrower circumstances as well as the economy in general. We have an experienced chief credit officer, collections and credit departments that monitor the loan portfolio and seek to prevent any deterioration of asset quality.
 
Real estate acquired through foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. When real estate owned is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan, or its fair market value, less estimated selling expenses. Any further write-down of real estate owned is charged against earnings. At December 31, 2018, we owned $917,000 of property classified as real estate owned.
 
Nonperforming Assets. The following table sets forth the amounts and categories of our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. Included in nonperforming loans and assets are troubled debt restructurings, which are loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $66,000.
 
At December 31, 2018, we had no loans that were not currently classified as nonaccrual, 90 days past due or troubled debt restructurings, but where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have serious concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and that may result in disclosure as nonaccrual, 90 days past due or troubled debt restructurings.
 
Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the Company will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. The Company designates an asset as “special mention” if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants management’s close attention. The Company uses an eight point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The first four categories are considered not criticized, and are aggregated as “pass” rated. The criticized rating categories used by management generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The special mention category includes assets that are currently protected but are below average quality, resulting in an undue credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a substandard classification. Loans in the substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt, and have a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. Those loans that typically represent a specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses are placed in the doubtful category. As part of the periodic exams of Community Bank by the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the staff of such agencies reviews our classifications and determines whether such classifications are adequate. Such agencies have, in the past, and may in the future require us to classify certain assets which management has not otherwise classified or require a classification more severe than established by management. The following table shows the principal amount of special mention and classified loans at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

The total amount of special mention and classified loans decreased $10.0 million, or 23.9%, to $31.7 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $41.6 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in special mention loans was due to improved credit quality with the loan portfolio. In addition, as previously mentioned, three large originated commercial and industrial loans that had risk were charged-off in 2018. The decrease in substandard loans is primarily due to loan payoffs of originated commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loan relationships, these payoffs were by design and mitigated credit risk to the loan portfolio. In addition, a decrease in commercial and industrial loan relationships due to classified loan payoffs and paydowns.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance based on losses in the current loan portfolio, which includes an assessment of economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, loan loss experience, volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as other loan modifications, quality of the Company’s loan review system, the degree of oversight by the Company’s Board of Directors, existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations, effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements and other relevant factors. While management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making evaluations. Additions are made to the allowance through periodic provisions charged to income and recovery of principal and interest on loans previously charged-off. Losses of principal are charged directly to the allowance when a loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that the specific loss is probable. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available.

The allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due for principal and interest according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a loan’s effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, the observable market price, or, if the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the underlying collateral. When the measurement of an impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the impairment is recorded in a specific valuation allowance through a charge to the provision for loan losses. Any reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents management’s estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in the allowance for loan losses on the consolidated Statement of Condition.
 
Groups of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated for impairment based on the group’s historical loss experience adjusted for changes in trends, conditions and other relevant factors that affect repayment of the loans. Accordingly, we do not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment measurements, unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower.
 
The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical charge-off experience and expected loss given our internal risk rating process. The loan portfolio is stratified into homogeneous groups of loans that possess similar loss characteristics and an appropriate loss ratio adjusted for other qualitative factors is applied to the homogeneous pools of loans to estimate the incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The other qualitative factors considered by management include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

• | changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection practices; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments, including the condition of various market segments; 
• | changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; 
• | changes in the experience, ability and depth of management and the lending staff; 
• | changes in the trend of the volume and severity of the past due, nonaccrual, and classified loans; 
• | the existence of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; and 
• | the effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in our current portfolio.

 
Commercial real estate loans generally have higher credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, payment experience on loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the related real estate project, and this may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market and in the general economy.
 
Commercial and industrial business loans involve a greater risk of default than one- to four-residential mortgage loans of like duration because their repayment generally depends on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the sufficiency of collateral, if any.
 
This specific valuation allowance is periodically adjusted for significant changes in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows, observable market price or fair value of the collateral. The specific valuation allowance, or allowance for impaired loans, is part of the total allowance for loan losses. Cash payments received on impaired loans that are considered non-accrual are recorded as a direct reduction of the recorded investment in the loan. When the recorded investment has been fully collected, receipts are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until the previously charged-off principal is fully recovered. Subsequent amounts collected are recognized as interest income. If no charge-off exists, then once the recorded investment has been fully collected, any future amounts collected would be recognized as interest income. Impaired loans are not returned to accrual status until all amounts due, both principal and interest, are current and a sustained payment history has been demonstrated. Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) loans are generally considered impaired loans until such loans are performing in accordance with their modified terms. Once a TDR loan establishes a consistent payment history under the modified terms, then it is considered to return to accrual status. A constant payment history is generally demonstrated by payment under the modified terms for a period of least six consecutive months. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class, including commercial loans not considered impaired, as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential real estate and consumer loans. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect the Company’s estimate of probable losses. Generally, management considers all nonaccrual and TDR loans and certain renegotiated debt, when it exists, for impairment. The maximum period without payment that typically can occur before a loan is considered for impairment is 90 days. The past due status of loans receivable is determined based on contractual due dates for loan payments.

The allowance for loan losses increased $762,000, or 8.7%, to $9.6 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $8.8 million at December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs were $1.8 million during 2018 compared to $877,000 during 2017. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans ratio increased to 151.40% at December 31, 2018, compared to 121.31% at December 31, 2017. The increase was due to a decrease in nonperforming loans, mainly attributed to decreases in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial non-accrual loans, loan payoffs of TDR commercial and industrial loans and an increase in the allowance for loan losses.
 
Although we maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level that we consider to be adequate to provide for potential losses, there can be no assurance that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts or that we will not be required to make additions to the allowance for loan losses in the future. Future additions to our allowance for loan losses and changes in the related ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans are dependent upon the economy, changes in real estate values and interest rates, the view of the regulatory authorities toward adequate loan loss reserve levels, and inflation. Management will continue to periodically review the entire loan portfolio to determine the extent, if any, to which further additional loan loss provisions may be deemed necessary.
 
Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses. The following table summarizes changes in the allowance for loan losses by loan categories for each year indicated and additions to the allowance for loan losses, which have been charged to operations. Loans acquired in connection with mergers were recorded at their estimated fair value at the acquisition date and did not include a carryover of the pre-merger allowance for loan losses.

Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses. The following table sets forth the allocation of allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated. The table reflects the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans receivable. Management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the allowance by category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.

Investment Activities 
 
General. The Company’s investment policy is established by its board of directors. The policy emphasizes safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with the Company’s interest rate risk management strategy.
 
Our current investment policy permits us to invest in U.S. treasuries, federal agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, investment grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds, short-term instruments, and other securities. The investment policy also permits investments in certificates of deposit, securities purchased under an agreement to resell, bankers acceptances, commercial paper and federal funds. Our current investment policy generally does not permit investment in stripped mortgage-backed securities, short sales, derivatives, or other high-risk securities. Federal and Pennsylvania state laws generally limit our investment activities to those permissible for a national bank.
 
The accounting rules require that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent. Securities available for sale are reported at fair value, while securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. Our entire portfolio is designated as available-for-sale.
 
The portfolio consists primarily of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal bonds, and mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale. We expect the composition of our investment portfolio to continue to change based on liquidity needs associated with loan origination activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had no investment securities that were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired.
 
Under federal regulations, we are required to maintain a minimum amount of liquid assets that may be invested in specified short-term securities and certain other investments. Liquidity levels may be increased or decreased depending upon the yields on investment alternatives and upon management’s judgment as to the attractiveness of the yields then available in relation to other opportunities and its expectation of the level of yield that will be available in the future, as well as management’s projections as to the short-term demand for funds to be used in our loan originations and other activities.
 
U.S. Government and Agency Securities. At December 31, 2018, we held U.S. Government and agency securities with a fair value of $80.6 million compared to $65.9 million at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, these securities had an average expected life of 4.1 years. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments, such as mortgage-backed securities, our current investment strategy is to maintain investments in such instruments to the extent appropriate for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings, and for prepayment protection.
 
Municipal Bonds. At December 31, 2018, we held available-for-sale municipal bonds with a fair value of $44.6 million compared to $39.0 million at December 31, 2017. Nearly 75% of our municipal bonds are issued by local municipalities or school districts located in Pennsylvania. Our out of state concentration increased due to municipal bonds acquired in the FWVB merger. Municipal bonds may be general obligation of the issuer or secured by specific revenues. The majority of our municipal bonds are general obligation bonds, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the municipality, paid off with funds from taxes and other fees, and have ratings (when available) of A or above. We also invest in a limited amount of special revenue municipal bonds, which are used to fund projects that will eventually create revenue directly, such as a toll road or lease payments for a new building.
 
Mortgage-Backed Securities. We invest in mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”) securities insured or guaranteed by the United States government or government-sponsored enterprises. These securities, which consist of mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, had an amortized cost of $97.5 million and $17.1 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This was mainly due to mortgage-backed and CMO securities acquired in the FWVB merger. The fair value of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio was $97.8 million and $17.0 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018, all of the mortgage-backed and CMO securities in the investment portfolio had fixed rates of interest.
 
Mortgage-backed securities are created by pooling mortgages and issuing a security with an interest rate that is less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages. CMO’s generally are a specific class of mortgage-backed securities that are divided based on risk assessments and maturity dates. These mortgage classes are pooled into a special purpose entity, where tranches are created and sold to investors. Investors in a CMO are actually purchasing bonds issued by the entity, and then receive payments based on the income derived from the pooled mortgages. The various pools are divided into tranches are then securitized and sold to the investor. Mortgage-backed securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multifamily mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors, such as Community Bank. Some securities pools are guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements. However, mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our specific liabilities and obligations. Finally, mortgage-backed securities are assigned lower risk-weightings for purposes of calculating our risk-based capital level.

Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or acceleration of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. We periodically review current prepayment speeds to determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments.
 
Investment Securities Portfolio. The following table sets forth the composition of our investment securities portfolio at the dates indicated. Investment securities do not include FHLB of Pittsburgh and Atlantic Community Bankers’ Bank stock totaling $3.8 million, $4.3 million, and $3.7 million at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Sources of Funds 
 
General. Deposits have traditionally been the Company’s primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. The Company also uses borrowings, primarily FHLB of Pittsburgh advances, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and manage the cost of funds. In addition, funds are derived from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, loan sales, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
Deposits. Deposits are generated primarily from residents within the Company’s market area. The Company offers a selection of deposit accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate.
 
Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals.
 
The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts offered allows the Company to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on experience, the Company believes that its deposits are relatively stable. However, the ability to attract and maintain deposits and the rates paid on these deposits has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.
 
The following tables set forth the distribution of our average deposit accounts, by account type, for the years indicated.

Borrowings. Deposits are our primary source of funds for lending and investment activities. If the need arises, we may rely upon borrowings to supplement our supply of available funds and to fund deposit withdrawals. Our borrowings consist of advances from the FHLB, funds borrowed under repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased.
 
The FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for us and other member savings associations and financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our home mortgages, provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. We typically secure advances from the FHLB with one- to four-family residential mortgage, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. Advances are made pursuant to several different programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of a member institution’s stockholders’ equity or on the FHLB’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness. At December 31, 2018, we had a maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB of up to $373.4 million. At December 31, 2018, we had $20.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding, of which all were long-term borrowings.
 
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent business deposit customers whose funds, above designated target balances, are transferred into an overnight interest-earning investment account by purchasing securities from the Bank’s investment portfolio under an agreement to repurchase. We may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Short-term borrowings also consist of federal funds purchased.
 
At December 31, 2018, we also maintained a Borrower-In-Custody of Collateral agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland for advances of up to $107.9 million and multiple line of credit arrangements with various banks totaling $60.0 million. At December 31, 2018, we did not have any outstanding balances under any of these borrowing relationships.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
 General 
 
CB Financial Services, Inc., is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As such, it is registered with, subject to examination and supervision by, and otherwise required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.
 
Community Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank subject to extensive regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC. Community Bank’s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. Community Bank must file reports with the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions with other depository institutions. There are periodic examinations of the Bank by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC to review Community Bank’s compliance with various regulatory requirements. Community Bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a commercial bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress could have a material impact on the operations of Community Bank.
 
Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to CB Financial Services, Inc., and Community Bank. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on CB Financial Services, Inc. and Community Bank, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations involved.

Federal Legislation
 
The Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes to the regulatory structure for depository institutions and their holding companies. However, the Dodd-Frank Act’s changes go well beyond that and affect the lending, investments and other operations of all depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital for holding companies are restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. The legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect upon passage, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, such as Community Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks with $10 billion or less in assets are still examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also gave state attorney generals the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The legislation also increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008. The Dodd-Frank Act increased shareholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so called “golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. Further, the legislation requires that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans, directs the Federal Reserve to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage origination.
 
The Dodd Frank Act has resulted in an increased regulatory burden and compliance, operating and interest expense for the Company and Community Bank.
 
Bank Regulation
 
Business Activities. Community Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the applicable Pennsylvania law, federal law and applicable state and federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, Community Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits.
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require state banks to meet three minimum capital standards: a 1.5% tangible capital ratio, a 4% core capital to assets leverage ratio (3% for savings associations receiving the highest rating on the composite, or “CAMELS,” rating system for capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk), and an 8% risk-based capital ratio.
 
The risk-based capital standard for state banks requires the maintenance of Tier 1 (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 4% and 8%, respectively. In determining the amount of risk weighted assets, all assets, including certain off balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of 0% to 1250%, assigned by the regulations, based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Core capital is defined as common shareholders’ equity (including retained earnings), certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships. The components of supplementary capital include cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock, the allowance for loan losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Overall, the amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital. Additionally, an institution that retains credit risk in connection with an asset sale is required to maintain additional regulatory capital because of the purchaser’s recourse against the institution. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual associations where necessary.

At December 31, 2018, Community Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.
 
The FDIC and the other federal bank have revised their risk-based capital rule and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule applies to all depository institutions and top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more (such as Community Bank). Among other things, the rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4.0% to 6.0% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-in or opt-out is exercised. Community Bank elected the one-time opt-out election for the accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to be excluded from the regulatory capital calculation as of the March 31, 2015 Call Report. The rule limits a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The rule became effective for Community Bank on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in at 0.625% per year beginning January 1, 2016 and ended January 1, 2019, when the full 2.5% capital conservation buffer requirement became effective.
 
Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of capital. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2018, Community Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
 
Capital Distributions. The Pennsylvania Banking Code states, in part, that dividends may be declared and paid only out of accumulated net earnings and may not be declared or paid unless surplus is at least equal to capital. Dividends may not reduce surplus without the prior consent of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement.
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. The FDIC is required to assess the Bank’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. Failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications, such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
 
The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. Community Bank received a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent federal examination.
 
Transactions with Related Parties. A state-chartered bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution, such as Community Bank. The Company is an affiliate of Community Bank because of its control of Community Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a state chartered bank from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.

Community Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:
 

• | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Community Bank’s capital. 

 
In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Community Bank’s board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
 
Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under the Federal Prompt Corrective Action statute, the FDIC is required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized state-chartered banks under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital. An institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 8% or a leverage ratio or a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that generally is less than 4% is considered to be “undercapitalized”. An institution that has total risk-based capital less than 6%, a Tier 1 core risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3% is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.” An institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.”
 
Generally, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the “Pennsylvania Department of Banking” or “PDBS”) is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a state-chartered bank that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date that an institution is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any bank holding company of an institution that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC or the amount necessary to restore the institution to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures, such as a restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The PDBS may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
 
At December 31, 2018, Community Bank met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized.”
 
In addition, the final capital rule adopted in July 2013 revises the prompt corrective action categories to incorporate the revised minimum capital requirements of that rule.
 
Enforcement. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking maintains enforcement authority over Community Bank, including the power to issue cease and desist orders and civil money penalties and to remove directors, officers or employees. It also has the power to appoint a conservator or receiver for a bank upon insolvency, imminent insolvency, unsafe or unsound condition or certain other situations. The FDIC has primary federal enforcement responsibility over non-FRB-member state banks and has authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution-affiliated parties, including shareholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely to have an adverse effect on the bank. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or even $1 million per day in especially egregious cases. In general, regulatory enforcement actions occur with respect to situations involving unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, violations of law or regulation or breaches of fiduciary duty. Federal and Pennsylvania laws also establish criminal penalties for certain violations.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions, such as Community Bank. Deposit accounts in Community Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund.
 
Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates are based on each institution’s risk category and certain specified risk adjustments. Stronger institutions pay lower rates while riskier institutions pay higher rates. Assessments are based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity instead of total deposits, ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points.
 
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Community Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Community Bank does not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of its deposit insurance.
 
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. State-chartered banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
 
FHLB System. Community Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 12 regional FHLBs. The FHLB System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, Community Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. As of December 31, 2018, Community Bank was in compliance with this requirement. Community Bank also is able to borrow from the FHLB of Pittsburgh, which provides an additional source of liquidity for Community Bank.
 
Federal Reserve System. The FRB regulations require banks to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal, or NOW and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows for 2018: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $122.3 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $122.3 million. The first $16.0 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. Community Bank complies with the foregoing requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually and, for 2019, establish a 3% reserve ratio for aggregate transaction accounts up to $124.2 million, a 10% ratio above $124.2 million, and an exemption of $16.3 million.
Other Regulations
 
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Community Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Community Bank’s operations are also subject to federal and state laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

• | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 
• | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; 
• | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 
• | Truth in Savings Act; and 
• | Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such laws.

The operations of Community Bank also are subject to the:
 

• | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; 
• | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; 
• | The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires banks operating to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and 
• | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.

Holding Company Regulation
 
General. The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As such, the Company is registered with the Federal Reserve and is subject to regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over the Company and its non-bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary banking institution.
Capital. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to establish for all depository institution holding companies minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries.
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to issue regulations requiring that all bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
Dividends. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances, such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary depository institution becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the Company’s ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Acquisition. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, a federal statute, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a bank holding company. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock.

28
--

 

Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition.
 
Federal Securities Laws. The Company’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a result, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Emerging Growth Company Status. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” The Company qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold shareholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation. Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. The Company has not elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company. A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by nonaffiliates). In accordance with subsection (ii) above, the Company will lose its Emerging Growth Company Status effective December 31, 2019.
TAXATION
 
General. The Company and Community Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company and Community Bank.
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal and state income tax returns.
Federal Taxation. The federal income tax laws apply to the Company in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions. The Company may exclude from income 100% of dividends received from Community Bank as members of the same affiliated group of corporations. For federal income tax purposes, corporations may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding twenty taxable years, subject to certain limitations. For its 2018 fiscal year, the Company’s maximum federal income tax rate was 21%.
State Taxation. The Bank is subject to the Pennsylvania Bank and Trust Company Shares Tax, otherwise known as “shares tax.” The shares tax rate in the prior year was 0.89%. As of July 1, 2016, the Pennsylvania state legislature ratified an increase of the shares tax rate to 0.95% that became effective for tax years starting January 1, 2017. The tax is imposed on the Bank’s adjusted equity. The Company and Exchange Underwriters are subject to the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax, otherwise known as “CNI tax.” The CNI tax rate in 2018 was 9.99%. The tax is imposed on income or loss from the federal income tax return on a separate-company basis for the Company and Exchange Underwriters. The federal return income or loss is adjusted for various items treated differently by the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.
 
The FWVB merger has now exposed the Company to additional state tax filing requirements in West Virginia and Ohio. West Virginia imposes a state income tax at the rate 6.5% on the consolidated net income of the Company. The multi-state revenue generating activities will be apportioned according to state nexus rules and reported properly. The State of Ohio imposes an equity-based tax similar to the PA Shares Tax called Financial Institutions Tax (“FIT”) at a minimum tax of $1,000 or a rate of 0.8% for the first $200 million of Ohio based-equity, and then a declining rate thereafter. Based on management’s estimate, our Ohio FIT exposure will be $1,000 annually for the near future.
