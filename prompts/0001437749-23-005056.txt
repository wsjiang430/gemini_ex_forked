--------+---------

Overview 
 
LeMaitre Vascular is a global provider of medical devices and human tissue cryopreservation services largely used in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease, end-stage renal disease, and to a lesser extent cardiovascular disease. We develop, manufacture, and market vascular devices to address the needs of vascular surgeons and, to a lesser degree, other specialties such as cardiac surgeons, general surgeons and neurosurgeons. Our diversified portfolio of devices consists of brand name products that are used in arteries and veins and are well known to vascular surgeons. Our principal product offerings are sold globally, primarily in the United States, Europe, Canada and Asia Pacific. We estimate that the annual worldwide market for peripheral vascular devices exceeds $5 billion, within which we estimate that the market for our products is approximately $750 million.
 
We sell our products and services primarily through a direct sales force. As of December 31, 2022, our sales force was comprised of 131 sales representatives in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, including two export managers. Our worldwide headquarters is located in Burlington, Massachusetts, and we also have North American sales offices in Chandler, Arizona and Vaughan, Canada. Our European headquarters is located in Sulzbach, Germany, and we also have European sales offices in Milan, Italy; Madrid, Spain; and Hereford, England. Our Asia Pacific headquarters is located in Singapore, and we also have Asia-Pacific sales offices in Tokyo, Japan; Shanghai, China; Kensington, Australia; and Seoul, Korea. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 94% of our net sales were generated in territories in which we employ direct sales representatives. We also sell our products in other countries through distributors.

Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the markets for our products as well as our business. In response to COVID-19, many hospitals limited elective procedures in response to the onset of the pandemic and then periodically when infection rates have increased. Many of our devices are used in elective procedures. Additionally, our sales representatives’ access to hospitals and surgeons has periodically been restricted by hospitals or local governments. More recently, however, in many geographies we have seen restrictions eased. Since 2020, these dynamics have resulted in variable and unpredictable sales.
 
The Peripheral Vascular Disease Market 
 
Based on industry statistics, we estimate that peripheral vascular disease affects more than 200 million people worldwide and that the annual worldwide market for all peripheral vascular devices exceeds $5 billion. The disease encompasses a number of conditions in which the arteries or veins that carry blood to or from the legs, arms, or organs other than the heart become narrowed, obstructed, weakened, or otherwise compromised. In many cases peripheral vascular disease goes undetected, sometimes leading to life-threatening events including stroke, ruptured aneurysm, pulmonary embolism or death. Clinical studies have identified several factors that increase the risk of peripheral vascular disease, including smoking, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, lack of exercise, coronary artery disease, high cholesterol, and being over the age of 65. Demographic trends suggest an increase in the prevalence of peripheral vascular disease over time, driven primarily by rising levels of obesity and diabetes and an aging population. We believe that our strong brands, established sales force, suite of peripheral vascular device offerings, and broad network of vascular surgeon customers position us to capture an increasing share of this market.
 
Vascular surgeons treat peripheral vascular disease and perform vascular procedures associated with other diseases, such as end-stage renal disease. We estimate that there are more than 21,000 vascular surgeons worldwide. In contrast to other specialists, such as interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons perform both open vascular surgeries and endovascular procedures. Open vascular surgery involves opening the body, cutting vessels, and suturing. Endovascular procedures typically are minimally invasive, catheter-based procedures involving repairing vessels from within using real-time imaging. We estimate that in 2022, over 95% of our net sales were from devices used in open surgical procedures.
 
Our Business Strategies 
 
We have grown our business by using a simple three-pronged strategy: 1) pursuing a focused call point, 2) competing for sales of low-rivalry, niche products, and 3) expanding our worldwide direct sales force while acquiring and, to a lesser extent, developing complementary devices. We have used acquisitions as a primary means of further penetrating the peripheral vascular device market, and we expect to continue to pursue this strategy in the future. We currently manufacture most of our products in our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters.

• | Focused call point. We have historically directed our product offering and selling efforts towards the vascular surgeon, and estimate that in 2022 approximately 80% of our sales were from devices and cryopreserved tissue used by vascular surgeons. As vascular surgeons are typically positioned to perform both open vascular surgeries and endovascular procedures, we sell devices in both the open and endovascular markets to the same end user. More recently we have begun to explore adjacent market customers, or non-vascular surgeon customers, who can be served by our vascular device technologies, such as cardiac surgeons.

• | Low rivalry niche segments. We seek to build and maintain leading positions in niche segments, which we define as under $200 million in annual worldwide revenue. We believe that the relative lack of focus on these segments by larger competitors, as well as the differentiated features and consistent quality of our products, enable higher selling prices and market share gains. We have, however, also sought to sell complementary offerings into larger, more competitive market segments, particularly when we believe that our offerings in those segments are highly differentiated, such as the Artegraft biologic graft, Omniflow II biosynthetic graft, or RestoreFlow cadaveric tissue.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Direct sales force expansion, and the addition of complementary products through acquisitions and to a lesser extent research and development. We sell our products primarily through a direct sales force in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. We ended 2022 with 131 direct sales representatives, including two export managers. We believe that direct-to-hospital sales build closer customer relationships, allow for higher selling prices and gross margins, and are not subject to the risk of customer loss related to distributor turnover. In countries where we do not have a direct sales force, we sell our products through distributors. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 94% of our net sales were generated through our direct-to-hospital sales force, and no single hospital customer accounted for more than 2% of our net sales. We intend to further expand and diversify our product offerings and add new technology platforms, mostly through acquisitions. We believe our experience acquiring and integrating product lines and businesses is one of our competitive advantages. We continually evaluate the acquisition of additional product lines and businesses that may be complementary to our product offerings, refine our current product lines or develop new applications for our existing technologies. We also obtain regulatory approvals for our devices in new segments and geographies in order to further access the broader peripheral vascular device market and select other markets.

Acquisition History 
 
We were founded in 1983 by George D. LeMaitre, M.D., a vascular surgeon who designed and developed the LeMaitre Valvulotome. Through a combination of 24 complementary acquisitions as well as research and development, we have expanded to 16 product lines, which include 13 different product types:

2019 | Eze-Sit US | Valve cutters 
2019 | CardioCel | Biologic patches 
2020 | Artegraft | Biologic grafts 

 
We manufacture most of our devices in-house, having relocated the manufacturing operations of 19 of our 24 acquisitions to our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters. The human tissue processing and cryopreservation operations associated with RestoreFlow allografts take place in our Fox River Grove, Illinois facility. Artegraft biologic graft production takes place in our North Brunswick, New Jersey facility. On a limited basis, we use third party manufacturers and we currently purchase our CardioCel and VascuCel patches from Anteris Technologies Ltd (formerly Admedus Ltd) in Malaga, Australia. We are in the process of relocating the production of these CardioCel and VascuCel patches to our Burlington headquarters.
 
Our Products and Services 
 
We have a portfolio of 16 product lines, which include 13 different product types, most of which are used to treat vascular disease, and most of which are used in open vascular surgery and dialysis access. We also offer human vascular tissue cryopreservation services. No single product line accounted for more than 20% of our revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020.
 
Our 13 product offerings include a suite of biologic products. These offerings include the XenoSure patch (bovine pericardium), CardioCel and VascuCel patches (bovine pericardium), ProCol graft (bovine mesenteric vein), Artegraft (bovine carotid artery), Omniflow II biosynthetic graft (ovine tissue and synthetic mesh) and RestoreFlow Allograft cryopreservation services (human cadaveric tissue). These biologic offerings represented 49% of our sales in 2022, 48% of our sales in 2021, and 43% in 2020.
 
Allografts
 
Through our RestoreFlow allograft business, we provide human cadaver tissue cryopreservation services, in particular the processing and cryopreservation of veins and arteries. Our RestoreFlow allografts are cryopreserved human tissue grafts, including saphenous veins, femoral veins and arteries, aortic and iliac arteries, aortic and pulmonary valved conduits and pulmonary patches. These allografts are used in a variety of vascular reconstructions such as peripheral bypass, hemodialysis access, and aortic infections, as well as in cardiac repair and reconstruction.

Angioscopes 
 
The PeriVu Disposable Angioscope is a fiberoptic catheter used for viewing the lumen of a blood vessel. PeriVu also provides direct visualization of valves during in-situ bypass procedures.
Balloon Catheters for Embolectomy and Thrombectomy 
 
Our TufTex and Syntel lines of embolectomy catheters are used to remove blood clots from arteries. We sell single-lumen latex and latex-free embolectomy catheters, as well as dual-lumen latex and latex-free embolectomy catheters. The dual-lumen embolectomy catheters enable clot removal and simultaneous irrigation or guide-wire trackability. Our Syntel thrombectomy catheter features a silicone balloon and is designed for removing thrombi in the venous system.
Balloon Catheters for Occlusion and Perfusion 
 
Occlusion catheters temporarily occlude blood flow to allow the surgeon time and space to complete a procedure. Perfusion catheters perfuse blood and other fluids into the vasculature. Our Pruitt line of occlusion and perfusion catheters reduces vessel trauma by using internal balloon fixation rather than traditional external clamp fixation.
Bovine Grafts 
 
Our Artegraft biologic graft is a bovine carotid artery used for dialysis access in patients with or without a previously-failed synthetic graft. Its biological fibrous matrix is processed to enhance long-term patency and provide a tightly woven, cross-linked conduit that is flexible and compliant. Artegraft is also indicated for lower extremity bypass.
Vascular and Cardiac Patches 
 
Our XenoSure biologic patches are made from bovine pericardium and are used primarily for closure of vessels after surgical intervention.
 
Our VascuCel and CardioCel biologic patches are acellular, collagen bioscaffolds with optimized biocompatibility and zero aldehyde toxicity. These bovine pericardium patches are used in vessel repair as well as heart repair and reconstruction, including neonatal repairs.
Carotid Shunts 
 
Our Pruitt F3 and Flexcel carotid shunts are used to temporarily shunt blood to the brain while the surgeon removes plaque in a carotid endarterectomy surgery. Our Pruitt F3 shunt features internal balloon fixation. Our Flexcel shunt is a non-balloon shunt offered for surgeons who prefer external fixation.
Closure Systems 
 
Our AnastoClip AC and AnastoClip GC closure systems attach vessels to one another with titanium clips instead of sutures. These closure systems create an interrupted anastomosis that expands and contracts as the vessel pulses, which some surgeons believe improves the durability of the anastomosis. The AnastoClip AC and AnastoClip GC closure systems also enable dura closure in neuro applications. 
Ovine Vascular Grafts
 
Our Omniflow II biosynthetic vascular graft is a composite of cross-linked ovine collagen with a polyester mesh endoskeleton. It is indicated for lower extremity bypass and dialysis access. This device is not available in the United States.
Polyester Vascular Grafts 
 
Our AlboGraft, Wovex and Dialine II vascular grafts are collagen-impregnated polyester grafts used to bypass or replace diseased arteries. These prostheses are available in straight tube and bifurcated versions.
ePTFE Vascular Grafts
 
Our LifeSpan ePTFE vascular graft is an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft used to bypass or replace diseased arteries and to create dialysis access sites. LifeSpan is available in both regular and thin wall options with optional full or partial external spiral support. Our stepped and tapered LifeSpan grafts are designed to reduce the risk of steal syndrome and high cardiac output, complications that sometimes arise in dialysis access grafts.

Radiopaque Tape 
 
Our VascuTape radiopaque tape is a flexible, medical-grade tape with centimeter or millimeter markings printed with a proprietary radiopaque ink which is visible to the eye and an x-ray machine or fluoroscope. VascuTape is applied to the skin and provides interventionalists with a simple way to cross-reference between the inside and the outside of a patient’s body, allowing them to locate tributaries or lesions beneath the skin.
Valvulotomes 
 
Our valvulotomes cut or disrupt valves in the saphenous vein, a vein that runs from the foot to the groin, so the vein can be repurposed as an artery to carry blood past diseased arteries to the lower leg or foot. We believe our valvulotomes reduce costs for hospitals by enabling lower extremity bypass surgery to be performed with several small incisions rather than one continuous ankle-to-groin incision, thereby reducing hospital stays and the likelihood of wound complications.
Sales and Marketing 
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 131 sales representatives, including two export managers. We believe the expansion of our sales force since 1998 has been a key success factor, and it remains one of our primary long-term strategies. Approximately 94% of 2022 net sales occurred in territories in which we employ sales representatives. Outside our direct markets, we generally sell our products through country-specific distributors.
 
Our marketing efforts include direct mail, digital marketing and exhibitions at medical congresses, which we believe are important to our brand development. We believe that marketing allows us to connect with vascular surgeons who are beyond the reach of our direct sales force and also reinforces our brand recognition and product offering to current customers.
 
We also provide training to our vascular surgeons on specific procedures including in situ bypass, carotid endarterectomy and interrupted anastomosis, as well as a general surgical skills training program targeting less-experienced doctors as a way to introduce them to our product offerings.
 
Research and Development 
 
Our more recent research and development efforts have focused on cardiac allograft and next-generation powered phlebectomy projects, as well as manufacturing transfers, including the transfer of the manufacturing of VascuCel and CardioCel biologic patches and the OmniFlow II product line to Burlington. In addition, in 2022 our research and development group continued to provide support to our growing regulatory and clinical efforts. In 2022 we completed the relocation work for the OmniFlow II product line and were granted approval to market devices manufactured in Burlington in the European Union. Additionally, a significant portion of the CardioCel and VascuCel transfer to Burlington has been completed and we anticipate that we will apply for regulatory approval to market those devices in the United States and European Union in 2023.
 
We often use feedback received from independent physicians to demonstrate product functionality before commencing full-scale marketing of any product. To this end, we have initiated the Limited Market Release (LMR) of the next-generation powered phlebectomy device, PhasTIPP, in the United States. Approximately half of the necessary LMR cases have been completed and we anticipate a full launch in the United States in the first half of 2023. Separately, in 2022 we began the review and update of the manufacturing process of the Artegraft product line in an effort to apply for its European MDR CE Mark. We will prioritize the “Artegraft MDR Readiness” project within the department and expect this to consume significant resources over the next two years.
 
Our regulatory and clinical efforts have historically been focused on obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals in various geographies. In the past we have typically not conducted clinical trials as we have usually acquired product lines with regulatory approvals already established. In addition, we preferred to avoid the time, expense and risk associated with initiating clinical trials. However, increasing regulatory requirements in many geographies have resulted in the need for more clinical testing.  As such, this component of our research and development spending has increased in recent years. In 2017, we initiated clinical trials in an effort to obtain the approval of our XenoSure patch in China for cardiac and vascular indications. We have completed enrollment of the trials and submitted the cardiac license application in June, 2022. We expect to make our vascular submission to the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in 2023. In 2021 we also entered into an agreement with Anteris (formerly Admedus) to assume primary responsibility for the post-market clinical follow-up studies of our CardioCel and VascuCel products.
 
In 2017 the European Union adopted the new Medical Device Regulation (2017/745) (MDR), which replaced the European Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EC as amended by 2007/47/EC) (MDD) and which took effect as of May 26, 2021. After this date, our MDD certificates then in effect remain valid until their expiration dates, which range from August 2023 to May 2024. Our products will then be subject to the MDR, which require all of our products, regardless of classification, to obtain a new CE mark in accordance with the new, more stringent standards. Going forward, we expect a significant portion of our regulatory and clinical time and expenses to be devoted to this transition. In the first quarter of 2023, we received our first MDR CE marking for our F3 Shunt product line. See –“Government Regulation” below for more information about the status of our MDD certificates.

Manufacturing and Processing 
 
Our primary manufacturing facilities are located in Burlington, Massachusetts. We also have facilities in North Brunswick, New Jersey where Artegraft is produced, and Fox River Grove, Illinois where RestoreFlow allografts are processed.
 
Our strategy is to transfer the manufacturing of most acquired lines into our Burlington operations. In 2019, we expanded our biologic clean room, and in 2020, we began the manufacturing transfer of Omniflow II in this new clean room. In 2020, we completed the transfer of the Syntel embolectomy business we had acquired from Applied Medical. In 2019, we leased a fifth Burlington building and relocated substantially all of our administrative functions into this building so we could expand our manufacturing footprint. In 2021, we completed the construction of another biologic clean room where we will manufacture CardioCel and VascuCel. Additionally, in 2022, we expanded the footprint of our main cleanroom and raw materials warehouse by approximately 40% in an effort to accommodate increased production and the direct labor hiring surge that occurred in 2021 and 2022. We believe that this expansion will improve working efficiency for our current operations staff.
 
We manufacture certain proprietary components, assemble most of our devices ourselves, and inspect, test, and package all of our finished products. By manufacturing many of our products from raw materials, and assembling and testing as many of our subassemblies and products as practical, we believe we can maintain better quality control, ensure compliance with applicable regulatory standards and internal specifications, limit outside access to our proprietary technology, ensure adequate product supply for our customers, and make design modifications in a timely manner. We have custom-designed proprietary manufacturing and processing equipment and have developed proprietary enhancements for existing production machinery. Our products are built to stock.
 
We process and cryopreserve human tissue provided to us by qualified U.S. tissue procurement organizations. Donated human tissue is procured from deceased donors by these organizations. We have specifications relating to the physical condition and characteristics of the tissue and the donor, the medical history of the donor and certain test results of the donated tissue. We also use various supplies in connection with the processing and cryopreservation of human tissue, including certain proprietary solutions and antibiotics.
 
Our management information systems provide us with the ability to evaluate our performance, collect business intelligence, and make better strategic decisions. These systems include customer relationship management, order entry, invoicing, on-line inventory management, lot traceability, purchasing, shop floor control, shipping and distribution analysis, as well as various accounting-oriented functions. These systems enable us to track our products from order inception through manufacturing and then through delivery to our customers.
 
We purchase certain components from, and have certain product lines manufactured by, third parties. Most of our components are readily available from several supply sources, but we do rely on single- and limited-source suppliers for several of our key product components and our third-party-manufactured products, most notably the purchase of CardioCel and VascuCel devices from Anteris in Malaga, Australia. While we do have a contractual arrangement with Anteris, we do not have contractual arrangements with many of our suppliers and manufacturers, and we order our supplies and products on an as-needed basis. There are relatively few, or in some cases no, alternative, validated sources for these supplies, products and components. At any time, our suppliers could discontinue or become incapable of the manufacture or supply of these materials on acceptable terms or otherwise. We do not ordinarily carry a significant inventory of these supplies, products and components. Identifying and qualifying additional or replacement suppliers, if required, may not be accomplished quickly or at all and could involve significant additional costs. To date, we have not experienced any significant supply disruptions from existing sources of supplies, products and components, but there is no guarantee that we will not experience such disruptions in the future.
 
Our Burlington and North Brunswick manufacturing facilities have been certified to ISO 13485 quality management system standards, which enables us to satisfy certain regulatory requirements of the EU, Canada, and other foreign jurisdictions. Our Fox River Grove, Illinois facility has been accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks for the processing, storage and distribution of cardiac and vascular tissue for transplantation and licensed by certain state agencies. Our manufacturing and processing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by various regulatory authorities and Notified Bodies (described below) to ensure compliance with domestic and international regulatory requirements. See “Government Regulation” for further information.
 
Competition 
 
The segments in which our product lines compete are characterized by periodic change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. No one company competes against all of our product lines; rather, we compete with a range of companies. Notable larger competitors include Abbott, Baxter International, Inc., Artivion, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Getinge, LifeNet Health, Silk Road Medical, Terumo Medical Corporation, and W. L. Gore & Associates.

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, regulatory, marketing, sales, and personnel resources than we do. Certain of these competitors are able to manufacture at lower costs and may therefore offer comparable products at lower prices, especially commodity products such as polyester and ePTFE vascular grafts. Certain of these competitors may also have greater experience in developing and improving products, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing such products. In the case of allografts, certain competitors may have an advantage in sourcing tissue due to higher volume purchases and longer term relationships with tissue procurement organizations. Additionally, some of our competitors may obtain patent protection or regulatory approval or clearance, or achieve product commercialization before us, any of which could adversely affect our business.
 
The success of our products relies on effective service support as well as superior product technology, quality, product and service availability, reliability, ease of use, cost-effectiveness, physician familiarity, and brand recognition. While we also compete on the basis of price, our more technologically advanced products are often sold at higher prices. We believe our continued success may depend on our ability to broaden and optimize our direct sales channel, acquire complementary vascular devices, obtain regulatory and reimbursement approvals, maintain sufficient inventory, and retain skilled personnel. We also compete on the basis of procedure type. The treatment of peripheral vascular disease has experienced a shift from open vascular surgery towards minimally invasive endovascular procedures, and most of our products are used primarily in open vascular surgery. Our ability to compete effectively relies on keeping pace with product offerings in the vascular device market, as well as in the minimally invasive endovascular market.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
We believe that our success is dependent, to a certain extent, on the development and maintenance of proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of trade secret laws, patents, trademarks and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights.
 
We maintain a limited portfolio of patents in the United States, and our issued U.S. patents are set to expire from 2023 to 2031.
 
We believe that our brands have been an important factor in our success. We rely on common law and registered trademarks to protect our brands. Some of our registered trademarks are LeMaitre, Artegraft, XenoSure, Pruitt, VascuTape, Glow ‘N Tell and RestoreFlow, each of which is registered in the U.S., the European Union, or both, and in certain cases in other foreign countries.
 
We rely on trade secret protection for certain unpatented aspects of other proprietary technology. Most of our products are not protected by patents. Patent protection is not available when we acquire a commercialized product that is not patented, such as the Artegraft biologic graft we acquired in June 2020. In the past, other companies have independently developed or otherwise acquired comparable or substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, and there can be no assurance that others will not do so in the future or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. We have a policy of requiring employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship. Our confidentiality agreements also require our employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us. We also generally require our consultants to assign to us any inventions made during the course of their engagement. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for us in the event of unauthorized use, transfer, or disclosure of confidential information or inventions.
 
The laws of foreign countries generally do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws and we may experience more difficulty enforcing our proprietary rights in certain foreign jurisdictions.
 
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a description of certain risks associated with our intellectual property.
 
Government Regulation 
 
Medical devices and human tissues are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA, and, in some instances, other federal and state authorities and foreign governments.
 
United States Regulation of Medical Devices 
 
Most of our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under 21 U.S. Code Chapter 9, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA). FDA regulations govern, among other things, product development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, and import and export.

Premarket Pathways 
 
Most medical devices must receive either 510(k) clearance or Premarket Application approval (PMA approval) from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution; this is known as 510(k) clearance. Some low-risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Class II devices may be subject to special controls, such as performance standards and FDA guidelines that are not applied to class I devices. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device or to a pre-amendment class III device (i.e., one in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976) for which PMA applications have not been called, are placed in class III, which generally requires PMA approval. In all cases, a user fee is required for 510(k) submissions and PMA applications, which in the case of PMA applications can be very costly.
 
510(k) Clearance. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and performance to a “predicate device” (i.e., a previously 510(k)-cleared class I or class II device or a pre-amendment class III device for which the FDA has not yet called for PMA applications). The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months, but it can take longer. In reviewing a premarket notification, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data. Nearly all of our devices currently sold in the U.S. are marketed pursuant to 510(k) clearance, with the exception of our Artegraft biologic vascular graft.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change as specified by FDA guidelines, requires a new 510(k) clearance. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 
PMA Approval. The PMA approval pathway requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the proposed device to the FDA’s satisfaction, making this pathway much more costly, lengthy, and uncertain. A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data, as well as detailed information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR) which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures on the manufacturing process.
 
If the FDA approves a PMA, the approved indications or claims may be more limited than those originally sought. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes to be necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required if the device or its labeling or manufacturing process are modified. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.
 
Clinical Trials. A clinical trial is typically required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required to support 510(k) clearance. In some cases, one or more smaller feasibility Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) studies may precede a pivotal IDE clinical trial intended to comprehensively demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational device. All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s extensive requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients (as defined in the regulations), the FDA, prior to initiation of clinical use, must approve an IDE application showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A non-significant risk device does not require submission to the FDA of an IDE application. Both significant risk and non-significant risk investigational devices require approval from institutional review boards (IRBs) at the study centers where the device will be used. The FDA and the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. During a study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting, record keeping, and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with all reporting and record-keeping requirements. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. Prior to granting PMA approval, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the study and the clinical data supporting the PMA application for compliance with IDE requirements.
 
Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing.

Historically, our products have been introduced into the U.S. market using 510(k) clearance, and we have not used the PMA process for any products that we currently market or sell in the U.S., other than our Artegraft vascular grafts, which had PMA approval at the time we acquired the device.
 
Postmarket Regulation 
 
After a device is placed on the market, regardless of the classification or premarket pathway, significant regulatory requirements apply. These include:
 

• | annual manufacturing establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR compliance, which requires finished device manufacturers, including third-party or contract manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures in all aspects of manufacturing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved, or off-label uses and other requirements related to promotional activities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA any field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements. The most recent FDA inspection of our Burlington facility was in May 2022, the results of which yielded five sets of observations that were subsequently addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction. Non-compliance with applicable FDA requirements can result in, among other things, public warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the FDA to grant marketing approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals, a recommendation by the FDA to disallow us to enter into government contracts, and criminal prosecutions. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by us. In the event that one of our suppliers fails to maintain compliance with our quality requirements, we may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result.
 
We participate in the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP), which allows manufacturers to undergo a universal quality system audit that is accepted in the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada and Brazil in lieu of individual routine audits by each regulator. Maintenance of this certification is a requirement to maintain sales in certain geographies including Canada. Failure to maintain this certification in good standing could result in suspension of our sales efforts in Canada or the other geographies. Our last MDSAP audit was in March 2022 and the results of the audit were deemed satisfactory by SGS, our notified body.
 
International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved or cleared by the FDA for use in the U.S., or are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Before exporting such products to a foreign country, we must first comply with the FDA’s regulatory procedures for exporting unapproved devices.
 
United States Regulation of Human Tissue 
 
FDA 
 
Our allografts are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1271 (Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products). These regulations were promulgated under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which authorized the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the spread of communicable disease. Under these regulations, the FDA requires registration of establishments that process human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products. These FDA regulations also establish donor-eligibility criteria, current good tissue practice and other procedures to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases by such products, including through donor screening and testing. Our Fox River Grove, Illinois facility and our Chandler, Arizona facility are both registered with the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. The regulations also provide for the inspection of tissue establishments by the FDA. The FDA most recently inspected our Fox River Grove, Illinois facility in July 2018 and the results of that inspection were satisfactory. In the event of non-compliance with these regulations, the FDA may issue a warning letter, order the recall and/or destruction of tissues and/or order the suspension or cessation of processing and preservation of new tissues.

AATB 
 
We voluntarily comply with the standards of the tissue bank industry’s accreditation organization, the American Association of Tissue Banks (the AATB). The AATB has established standards for tissue banking and administers an accreditation program. Compliance with the AATB’s standards are a predicate to accreditation, which must be renewed every three years. Our Fox River Grove, Illinois facility has been accredited by the AATB for the processing, storage and distribution of cardiac and vascular tissue for transplantation through May 13, 2024. The AATB is entitled to inspect accredited members at any time. The AATB most recently inspected our Fox River Grove, Illinois facility in October 2020, and the results were satisfactory.
NOTA 
 
Under the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), it is unlawful for any person or entity to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce. However, “valuable consideration” excludes reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, and storage of a human organ. We believe the compensation we receive with respect to our allografts falls within this statutory exception.
State Regulation 
 
Certain states regulate the processing, storage and distribution of human tissue. We are licensed or registered, as applicable, with California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Oregon. The regulatory agencies of these states may inspect our Fox River Grove, Illinois facility from time to time to monitor compliance with applicable state regulations.
Other U.S. Regulations 
 
We, and our products and services, are also subject to a variety of state and local laws in those jurisdictions where our products and services are or will be marketed or distributed, and federal, state, and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationships with the physicians and others who purchase or make referrals for our products. For instance, federal law prohibits payments of any form that are intended to induce a referral for any item payable under Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federal healthcare program. Many states have similar laws. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future, or that such laws or regulations will not have an adverse effect on our business.
 
We are subject to federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling, and disposal of certain hazardous and potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our operations. Although we believe that we have complied with these laws and regulations in all material respects, and have never been required to correct any noncompliance, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations in the future.
 
International Regulation of Medical Devices 
 
Sales of medical devices are subject to regulatory requirements in many countries. The regulatory review process may vary greatly from country to country. The EU has adopted numerous directives and standards relating to medical devices regulating their design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling, and adverse event reporting, including the MDD, and more recently, the MDR, which are applicable to our products. Devices that comply with the requirements of the MDD and MDR are entitled to bear a CE mark, indicating that the device conforms with the essential requirements of the applicable directive/regulations and can be commercially distributed in countries that are members of the EU, as well as the United Kingdom, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Turkey and Switzerland. Each member state of the EU has implemented the directives/regulations into its respective national law and has each established a “Competent Authority” to apply the directive/regulations in its territory.
 
The MDD and MDR classification system places devices into Class I, IIa, IIb, or III, depending on the risks and characteristics of the medical device. The MDD and MDR also define the essential requirements (or general safety performance requirements) that devices must meet before being placed on the market, establishes assessment procedures for approving a device, and creates mechanisms for Competent Authorities to manage implementation or to intervene when public health requires. Essential requirements include manufacturing, design, performance, labeling, and safety requirements, and may include providing certain clinical data. These requirements vary based on the device classification and other related factors.
 
A manufacturer of low-risk devices typically may demonstrate conformity based on a self-declaration. The European Standardization Committees have adopted numerous harmonized standards for specific types of medical devices. Compliance with relevant standards establishes a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. Manufacturers of higher-risk devices generally must use a “Notified Body”—an appointed independent third party—to assess conformity. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s devices. An assessment by a Notified Body in one country within the EU is generally required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU. Most of our devices are considered higher-risk devices that require Notified Body assessment.
 
   14

 

EU medical device laws also address advertising and promotion of medical devices, clinical investigations, and requirements for handling adverse events. Post-market surveillance of medical devices is generally conducted on a country-by-country basis; however, the MDD and MDR set forth certain specific requirements for reporting adverse events. The Medical Device Vigilance system is the mechanism by which adverse event reporting is managed and monitored in the EU.
 
Our products are regulated in the EU under the European MDD and the MDR. In order to market our medical devices in the EU, we are required to obtain CE mark certifications, which denote conformity, and manufacturers of higher-risk devices generally must use a “Notified Body”—an appointed independent third party to assess conformity. We currently use three Notified Bodies for our various products. We have received CE marks under the MDD to sell most of our products and have one product CE marked under the MDR.
 
In April 2017, the EU adopted the new MDR regulations for medical devices, which replace the MDD and which took effect as of May 26, 2021. Our products will be subject to the MDR, which requires all of our products, regardless of classification, to obtain a new CE mark in accordance with the new, more stringent standards under the MDR. As a condition to CE mark approval, clinical evidence from clinical investigations will be required for Class III and implantable devices. As our Notified Bodies continue their transition from MDD to MDR, they have begun to enforce these more rigorous requirements on us in order to maintain the CE marks on certain of our products. Additionally, for any of our products for which the CE marks under MDD lapsed before May 26, 2021, we will need to reinitiate the application process in its entirety under the MDR, a process that could take up to two years for each product. As of May 26, 2021 we had two products’ CE marks lapse which represented less than 1% of our EU sales, and we have only recently started the application process for one of those products. If we fail to obtain new CE marks on these products or any of our other products under the MDR in a timely manner, or at all, future sales of our products in the EU could be adversely impacted. In January 2023, we received our first CE marking under the MDR for our Pruitt F3 Shunt. The CE Marks for our CardioCel and Vascucel products are currently set to expire in August 2023. We expect to submit our MDR application in June 2023 and will experience a lapse in CE validity until such approvals are rendered, which could take 24 months. If we cannot obtain an interim approval, our inventory may not be sufficient to support sales, and that could hurt our sales in the EU.
 
The United Kingdom left the EU on January 31, 2020, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. We opened our Hereford, England office in 2019 largely in response to Brexit. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the U.K. and the EU, the U.K. was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020. After December 31, 2020, medical device manufacturers wishing to import their devices into the U.K. were provided a transition period for registration of their devices until the end of 2021. We have complied with this deadline and all of our CE marks continue to be recognized in the U.K. The U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has announced that CE marking will continue to be recognized in the U.K. and certificates issued by EU-recognized notified bodies will continue to be valid in the U.K. market until July 1, 2024. After this date, all devices marketed in the U.K. will require U.K. Conformity Assessed (“UKCA”) Marks certified by a U.K. Approved Body. If we fail to obtain UKCA conformity by this July 2024 deadline, or at all, our sales in the U.K. could be negatively affected. In January 2023 we received our first UKCA mark for the Pruitt F3 Shunt.
 
In the event that any of our products prove to be defective, we can voluntarily recall, or the FDA or international equivalent could require us to implement a recall of, any of our products and, if someone is harmed by a malfunction or a product defect, we may experience product liability claims for such defects. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital and may harm our reputation and financial results. Future recalls or claims could also result in significant costs to us and significant adverse publicity, which could harm our ability to market our products in the future.
 
In some cases, we rely on international distributors or third party agents to obtain premarket approvals, complete product registrations, comply with clinical trial requirements, and complete those steps that are customarily taken in the applicable jurisdictions to comply with governmental and quasi-governmental regulation. In the future, we expect to continue to rely on distributors and agents in this manner where appropriate.
 
Canada regulates the import and sale of medical devices through Health Canada (HC). HC classifies medical devices into four classifications, with Class I being the lowest risk and Class IV being the highest. Class I and II devices are often cleared for sale after they are CE marked or listed on the company’s ISO certification and filed via fax-back applications. Higher classification risk devices (Class III and IV) require filing dossiers that resemble Unites States 510(k) applications. These applications can range in cost and typically take longer for approval. As a holder of Canadian device licenses, we are subject to inspection by HC at our Vaughan, Canada office, and we must maintain a valid Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) certificate. Our Vaughan, Canada office was most recently inspected in August 2017, the results of which were satisfactory. Our Burlington office was most recently audited under the MDSAP in March 2022, the results of which were satisfactory.
 
   15

 

In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) regulates medical devices through the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, which was reformed effective April 1, 2005. As a holder of Japanese device licenses, we are also subject to inspection by several Japanese authorities including Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency (PMDA), Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG), and third parties such as Japan’s Electrical Safety & Environmental Technologies Laboratories (JET). Our Japanese office was most recently inspected by JET in March 2022, the results of which were satisfactory.
 
Australia regulates the import and sale of medical devices through the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The TGA has built its regulatory framework around requirements similar to those issued in Europe. As such, many medical devices (those with a lower risk profile) may gain relatively fast marketing clearance using their existing EU-issued CE marking. Higher risk devices (those in EU/Aus Class III) must go through a full design review which can be costly and take longer to complete. Issued licenses for medical devices do not require renewal, but do require an annual fee to remain active in the TGA registry. As a holder of Australian device licenses, we are also subject to inspection by TGA in both Australia and the United States. Our North Melbourne facility, where we previously manufactured our Omniflow II graft until we transferred production to Burlington, was most recently inspected by TGA in December 2018, and our Burlington facility was most recently inspected in March 2022 under the MDSAP, the results of which were satisfactory. Australia requires all foreign manufacturers to have an in country ‘sponsor’ who must have a licensed business inside of Australia. Our licenses are managed on our behalf by our sponsor, Emergo Group.
 
In China, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) regulates and must approve all medical devices to be marketed and sold in China. China has a three-class risk classification system, with Class I being the lowest and Class III being the highest risk. Home country approval, such as 510(k) or PMA clearance, is required as a prerequisite to any application. Additionally, the NMPA often tests devices at its own testing laboratory to confirm each device’s specifications. The approval process is typically lengthy and usually requires clinical trials. NMPA licenses are valid for five years from date of issuance and require renewal prior to expiration. As a holder of Chinese device licenses, we are subject to inspection by NMPA in both China and the United States. Our Shanghai offices were most recently inspected by NMPA in August 2018, the results of which were satisfactory. The NMPA requires all companies located outside of China to appoint a legal entity who maintains a registered business inside of China as the license holder. After the formation of our Chinese subsidiary in 2015, we transferred our licenses from our third-party license holders to our subsidiary.
 
There can be no assurance that new laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws and regulations regarding the release or sale of medical devices will not delay or prevent sale of our current or future products.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement 
 
United States 
 
Healthcare providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private payors (such as indemnity insurers, employer group health insurance programs, and managed care plans) to reimburse all or part of the cost of those products. As a result, demand for our products is and will continue to be dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors. The manner in which reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon the type of payor involved and the setting in which the product is furnished and utilized. For example, Medicare reimbursement policies favor outpatient treatment. Furthermore, payments from Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors are subject to legislative and regulatory changes and are susceptible to budgetary pressures.
 
In the U.S., third-party payors generally pay healthcare providers directly for the procedures they perform and in certain instances for the products they use. Our sales volumes depend on the extent to which third-party payors cover our products and the procedures in which they are used. In general, a third-party payor only covers a medical product or procedure when the plan administrator is satisfied that the product or procedure is medically necessary because it improves health outcomes, including quality of life or functional ability, in a safe and cost-effective manner. Even if a device has received clearance or approval for marketing by the FDA, there is no assurance that third-party payors will cover the cost of the device and related procedures in which the device is used.
 
In many instances, third-party payors cover the procedures performed using our products using price fee schedules that do not vary reimbursement to reflect the cost of the products and equipment used in performing those procedures. In other instances, payment or reimbursement is separately available for the products and equipment used, in addition to payment or reimbursement for the procedure itself. Even if coverage is available, third-party payors may place restrictions on the circumstances in which they provide coverage or may offer reimbursement that is not sufficient to cover the cost of our products. Many of the products that compete with ours are less expensive. Therefore, although coverage may be available for our products and the related procedures, the levels of approved coverage may not be sufficient to justify using our products instead of those of competitors.
 
   16

 

In addition, many third-party payors are moving to managed care systems in which providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person rather than the traditional fee for service model. Managed care providers often attempt to control the cost of healthcare by authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures. Under current prospective payment systems, such as the diagnosis-related group system and the hospital out-patient prospective payment system, both of which are used by Medicare and in many managed care systems used by private third party payors, the reimbursement for our products will be incorporated into the overall reimbursement of a procedure, and there will be no separate reimbursement for our products. As a result, we cannot be certain that hospital administrators and physicians will purchase our products.
 
If hospitals and physicians cannot obtain adequate reimbursement for our products or the procedures in which they are used, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could suffer a material adverse impact. 
 
International
 
Our success in international markets will depend largely upon the availability of reimbursement from the third-party payors through which healthcare providers are paid in those markets. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in non-U.S. markets vary significantly by country. The main types of healthcare payment systems are government sponsored healthcare and private insurance. As in the U.S., reimbursement is subject to legislative and regulatory changes and is susceptible to budgetary pressures. Reimbursement approval must be obtained individually in each country in which our products are marketed. Outside the United States, we may pursue reimbursement approval in those countries in which we sell directly to the hospital. In other markets, we generally rely on our distributors to obtain reimbursement approval. There can be no assurance that reimbursement approval will be received.
 
U.S. Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 
We may directly or indirectly be subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws. In particular, the U.S. federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. In implementing the statute, the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, has issued a series of regulations, known as “safe harbors.” Safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy safe harbors may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG.
 
U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
 
In March 2010, significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were adopted in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA). Under the PPACA we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which was enacted as part of the PPACA and requires detailed public disclosure of certain payments and “transfers of value” from us to healthcare professionals, such as the payment of royalties, compensation for services provided such as training, consulting, and reimbursement for travel and meal expenses. Certain states also require us to disclose similar information or even prohibit some forms of these payments.
Employees and Human Capital Management
 
We had 617 employees, including 591 full-time employees, at December 31, 2022. Our full-time employees are comprised functionally as follows: 327 manufacturing and operations, 175 sales and marketing, 51 general and administrative and 38 research and development.
 
We strive to create a demanding and rewarding work environment by emphasizing teamwork and decentralized decision-making. We are committed to providing equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, and all employment decisions are based on merit, qualifications, and abilities. LeMaitre Vascular does not discriminate in employment opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, breastfeeding or related medical conditions, religious dress, military or veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law. This policy governs all aspects of employment, including selection, job assignment, compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training.
 
We believe in providing competitive pay and benefits to all our employees. We utilize third party benchmark compensation data to determine market wages. Our compensation is designed to attract, retain, and motivate employees to achieve results while balancing short- and long-term company performance. In 2022, we increased our employer medical benefits contribution for hourly employees to 85% and implemented an annual Loyalty Award bonus program for hourly employees as well. We also work with external benefits consultants to evaluate the quality, competitiveness, and cost of our benefit offerings to all our employees.
 
   17

 

We review the number of new hires every month to understand our ability to attract talent. We also review our voluntary turnover to understand our ability to retain talent. In 2022, we increased our headcount by 141 full-time employees and our world-wide voluntary resignation rate was 14.7%.
