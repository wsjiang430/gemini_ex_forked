Industry Background
Laser technology has revolutionized a broad range of applications and products in various industries, including general manufacturing, automotive, medical, research, consumer products, electronics, semiconductors and communications. A laser works by converting electrical energy to optical energy. In a laser, an energy source excites or pumps a lasing medium, which converts the energy from the source into an emission consisting of particles of light, called photons, at particular wavelengths. Lasers provide flexible, non-contact and high-speed ways to process and treat various materials and are a key enabler of advanced manufacturing techniques including automation and miniaturization. They are incorporated into manufacturing, medical and other systems by OEMs, system integrators and end users. Also, they are widely used for various medical applications and test and measurement systems and to transmit large volumes of data in optical communications systems. For a wide variety of applications, lasers provide superior performance and a more cost-effective solution than non-laser technologies.
Lasers emit an intense light beam that can be focused on a small area, causing metals and other materials to melt, vaporize or change their character. These properties are utilized in materials processing applications requiring very high power densities, such as cutting, welding, marking and engraving, additive manufacturing, ablation, printing, drilling and cladding. Many different types of machine tools have been used within the materials processing industry to cut, form or otherwise process metal in the production of finished goods such as automobiles, consumer appliances, electronics, and heavy machinery. These machine tools include (but are not limited to) grinding machines, mechanical saws, milling machines, lathes, presses, stamping machines, electrical-discharge machines, plasma, water-jet and lasers. The Autumn 2018 Global Machine Tool Outlook by Oxford Economics estimates global machine tool consumption of $84 billion in 2018. Laser-based systems are increasingly gaining share within the materials processing market given the greater precision, processing speeds, and flexibility enabled by this technology. Because laser energy can be delivered remotely, with greater precision and power, the trends toward automated production, miniaturization and increasing product complexity are helping drive adoption of laser technology. Beyond materials processing, lasers are well-suited for imaging and inspection applications, and the ability to confine laser light to narrow wavelengths makes them particularly effective in medical and sensing applications. 
Other Laser Technologies
Historically, carbon dioxide ("CO2") gas lasers and crystal lasers have been the two principal laser types used in materials processing and many other applications. They are named for the materials used to create the lasing action. A CO laser produces light by electrically stimulating a gas-filled tube and delivers the beam through free space using mirrors to provide direction. A
Table of Contents

 crystal laser uses an arc lamp, pulsed flash lamp or diode stack or array to optically pump a special crystal. The most common crystal lasers use yttrium aluminum garnet ("YAG") crystals infused with neodymium or ytterbium. Crystal lasers also use mirrors in free space to deliver the beam or direct the beam through fiber optics.
Fiber Lasers
Fiber lasers use semiconductor diodes as the light source to pump specialty optical fibers, which are infused with rare earth ions. These fibers are called active fibers and are comparable in diameter to a human hair. The laser emission is created within optical fibers and delivered through a flexible optical fiber cable. As a result of their different design and components, fiber lasers are more reliable, efficient, robust, compact and easier to operate than other laser technologies. In addition, fiber lasers free the end users from fine mechanical adjustments and the high maintenance costs that are typical for other laser technologies.
Although low power fiber lasers were introduced four decades ago, their increased adoption in the last decade has been driven primarily by our improvements in their output power levels and cost, as well as their superior performance, lower cost of ownership and greater reliability compared with other laser technologies. We have successfully increased output power levels by developing improved optical components such as diodes and active fibers that have increased their power capacities and improved their performance. Fiber lasers now offer output powers that exceed those of other laser technologies in many categories. Also, semiconductor diodes historically have represented the majority of the cost of fiber lasers. In the past, the high cost of diodes meant that fiber lasers could not compete with other laser technologies on price and limited their use to high value-added applications. Over the last twenty years, however, our semiconductor diodes have become more affordable and reliable due, in part, to substantial advancements in semiconductor diode technology, packaging design and increased production volumes. As a result, the average cost per watt of output power has decreased dramatically over the last fifteen years. Because of these improvements, our fiber lasers can now effectively compete with other laser technologies over a wide range of output powers and applications, and begin to compete with non-laser technologies in many applications that did not use lasers historically. As a pioneer in the development and commercialization of fiber lasers, we have contributed to many advancements in fiber laser technology and products.
Advantages of Fiber Lasers
We believe that fiber lasers provide a combination of benefits that include:
•Superior Performance.    Fiber lasers provide uniform beam quality over the entire power range. In most other laser solutions, the beam quality is sensitive to output power, while in fiber lasers, the output beam is virtually non-divergent over a wide power range. A non-divergent beam enables higher levels of precision, increased power densities and the ability to deliver the beam over greater distances to where processing can be completed. The superior beam quality and greater intensity of a fiber laser's beam allow tasks to be accomplished more rapidly, with lower power units and with greater flexibility than comparable lasers.
•Enhanced End User Productivity.     The near-infrared ("IR") wavelengths produced by ytterbium fiber lasers are absorbed well by metals, enabling faster processing speeds than other lasers and non-laser technologies across many metal-based materials processing applications. Because IPG fiber lasers utilize rigorously-tested long-lived semiconductor diodes, unique active fibers to prevent photo darkening and other leading-edge, proprietary technologies, our fiber lasers have demonstrated greater uptime and reliability in the field, with less required maintenance and fewer service interventions than many competing technologies. 
•Cost of Ownership. Fiber lasers are less expensive to operate due to their faster processing speeds, higher energy efficiency and lower required maintenance costs. Fiber lasers convert electrical energy to optical energy approximately 2 to 3 times more efficiently than diode-pumped YAG lasers or disc lasers, approximately 3 to 4 times more efficiently than conventional CO2 lasers and approximately 15 to 30 times more efficiently than lamp-pumped YAG lasers. Because fiber lasers are much more energy-efficient and place lower levels of thermal stress on their internal components, they have substantially lower cooling requirements compared to those of other lasers, which also improves overall energy efficiency. Fiber lasers have lower maintenance costs due to the high performance and long life of our single-emitter diodes, fiber optics and other optical components.
•Ease of Use. Fiber lasers have numerous features which make them easier to operate, maintain and integrate into laser-based systems as compared to other lasers, many of which require mirrors to direct the beam. There are no moving parts in fiber lasers and the beam is contained in a flexible fiber optic cable so they do not require adjustments of internal components or mirrors to direct the beam.

•Compact Size.  Fiber lasers are typically smaller and lighter in weight than other lasers, saving valuable floor space. While other laser technologies are delicate due to the precise alignment of mirrors, fiber lasers are more durable and able to perform in variable environments.
•Choice of Wavelengths and Precise Control of Beam.    The design of fiber lasers generally provides a broad range of wavelength choices, allowing users to select the precise wavelength that best matches their application and materials. As the beam is delivered through a flexible fiber optic cable, it can be directed to the work area over longer distances without loss of beam quality.
Fiber amplifiers are similar in design to fiber lasers, use many of the same components, such as semiconductor diodes and specialty optical fibers, and provide many of the same advantages in the applications that require amplification.
Notwithstanding the benefits offered by fiber lasers, there remain applications and processes where other laser and non-laser technologies may provide superior performance with respect to particular features. For example, crystal lasers can provide higher peak power pulses necessary in certain applications and fiber lasers cannot generate the deep ("UV") light at the power levels required for photolithography in many semiconductor applications. In addition, CO2 lasers operate at wavelengths that are optimal for use on many non-metallic materials, including organic materials like wood.

Our Strategy
Our objective is to maintain and extend our leadership position in our industry by pursuing the following key elements of our strategy:
Leverage Our Technology to Increase Sales.    As fiber lasers become more widely accepted, we plan to leverage our position as the leader in fiber lasers and our applications expertise to develop solutions for customers and increase our position in the market. We believe that our fiber lasers can perform many tasks that have been done with other machine tools in current non-laser applications and will continue to displace other laser technologies. Over the last few years, our high power lasers have become widely accepted in two- and three-dimension cutting, one of the largest laser materials processing applications. We plan to continue to leverage our fiber laser technology by pursuing large-scale laser applications where our fiber lasers offer improved customer value and performance. Some of the more significant applications we intend to target include: (i) joining

 processes including laser welding and brazing, (ii) deposition technology (cladding) and additive manufacturing (also called 3D printing); (iii) ablation processes including cleaning and stripping of materials; and (iv) micro-processing, scribing and marking with high power green lasers, ultrafast pulsed lasers,  and UV and IR lasers now under development.
Target New Applications for Lasers and Expand into Broader Markets.    We intend to expand the use of fiber lasers into additional applications in which lasers are not widely used. We believe that the advantages of fiber laser technology can overcome many of the limitations that have hindered the broader adoption of laser technology. Using our manufacturing scale and technological innovations, we have been successful in reducing the cost of manufacturing with lasers, which we believe has made fiber lasers a more attractive manufacturing alternative as compared to other laser technologies and many non-laser methods. We target applications where the cost, reliability, mobility, quality of the final process and speed can lead customers to adopt fiber lasers instead of non-laser solutions. Certain industry trends such as the use of high-strength steel and aluminum in automotive manufacturing in order to decrease the weight of vehicles and improve structural rigidity are driving the use of fiber lasers over other manufacturing methods such as stamping, non-laser welding, riveting and adhesives. Other trends, such as increasing automation and miniaturization of parts and electronics, contribute to the use of lasers because no other tools can work as precisely or quickly. Large scale fiber laser applications outside of materials processing are also targeted. We are developing a fiber laser projection technology platform as an alternative to xenon bulb projection platforms in cinemas and other entertainment venues. Through our own manufacturing cost reductions and innovations, we have developed higher power lasers which have been adopted in the market both expanding the capability of existing and enabling new laser processing applications. 
Expand Our Product Portfolio.    We plan to continue to invest in research and development to produce lasers at additional wavelengths, power levels and more rapid pulse durations as well as new laser-based systems. We are developing and introducing lasers with ultrashort pulse durations (picosecond and femtosecond), UV and mid infra-red lasers. We have introduced a line of optical processing cutting, welding and scanning heads optimized for use with our laser sources. We have also grown our product portfolio through acquisitions. In 2018, we acquired Genesis System Group, LLC ("Genesis"), a leader in the integration of robotic welding and automation solutions, and robot concept, GmbH ("RC"), an integrator of laser-based systems. See footnotes to Financial Statements for description.  In 2017, we acquired Innovative Laser Technologies, LLC ("ILT"), a developer of high-precision laser systems for the medical device industry, OptiGrate, a pioneer of chirped volume Bragg grating technologies used in ultrafast lasers for pulse compression, and Laser Depth Dynamics Inc., which develops and manufactures in-process quality monitoring and control solutions for laser-based welding applications. 
Lower Our Costs Through Manufacturing Improvements and Innovation.    We plan to seek further improvements in component manufacturing processes and device assembly as well as innovation in components and device designs to improve performance and decrease the overall cost per watt for our products. As we increase our production volumes, we improve our internal manufacturing economies of scale and we believe we will be able to better negotiate price reductions with certain suppliers. We intend to leverage our technology and operations expertise to manufacture additional components in order to reduce costs, ensure component quality, ensure supply and improve product performance. We continue to manufacture more of the mechanical parts, printed circuit boards and power supplies we use and redesign certain optical components to improve quality and power capacities. We further decreased the manufacturing cost of our packaged diodes and other key components and sub-assemblies. We seek cost reductions to our integrated systems businesses through economies of scale, vertical integration and manufacturing know how. Additionally, we have developed the capability of growing and processing crystals used in certain of our lasers. By reducing the cost per watt of our lasers and maintaining the lower operating cost of our products, we believe that we can increase the use of fiber lasers in applications for which other laser technologies are not an economical or competitive option.
Expand Global Reach to Attract Customers Worldwide.    The acceptance of fiber laser technology has expanded in both developed and emerging markets around the world. As a result, we have increased and continue to increase our international sales and service locations to respond to our customer needs. In 2018, we continued to expand our facilities in Russia, the United States and Germany to increase manufacturing capacity and invest in our sales and service subsidiaries around the world.

Our Markets
Materials Processing
The most significant materials processing applications for fiber lasers are cutting, welding and brazing, marking and engraving, additive manufacturing such as 3D printing and ablation. Other applications include micro-processing, surface treatment, drilling, and annealing.
Cutting and Welding Applications.    Laser-based cutting technology has several advantages compared to alternative technologies. Laser cutting is fast, flexible and highly precise and can be used to cut complex contours on flat, tubular or three-dimensional materials. The laser source can be programmed to process many different kinds of materials such as steel, aluminum, brass, copper, glass, ceramic and plastic at various thicknesses. Laser cutting technology is a non-contact process that is easy to integrate into an automated production line and is not subject to wear of the cutting medium. We sell low, mid and high power ytterbium fiber lasers for laser cutting. High electrical efficiency, low maintenance and operating cost, high beam quality, wide operating power range, power stability and small spot size are some of the qualities offered by IPG fiber lasers for many cutting applications, which enable customers to cut a variety of materials faster.
Laser welding offers several important advantages compared to conventional welding technology as it is non-contact, easy to automate, provides high process speed and results in narrow-seamed, high-quality welds that generally require little or no post-processing machining. The high beam quality of our fiber lasers coupled with high CW power offer deep penetration welding as well as shallow conduction mode welding. In addition, fiber lasers can be focused to a small spot with extremely long focal lengths, enabling remote welding "on the fly," a flexible method of three-dimensional welding in which the laser beam is positioned by a robot-guided scanner. Such remote welding stations equipped with fiber lasers are used for welding door panels and seat backs, the multiple welding of spot and lap welds over the entire auto body frame, tailor blank welding and welding "body-in-white," which is welding pieces of metal with different thicknesses for automotive applications. Typically, mid to high power ytterbium fiber lasers and long-pulse QCW ytterbium fiber lasers are used in welding applications. Our products are used also for laser brazing of visible joints in automobiles such as tailgates, roof joints and columns. Brazing is a method of joining sheet metal by using a melted filler material similar to soldering but requiring higher temperatures.
3D Printing. Historically, metalworking has been performed with processes that remove material to produce component parts. The development of 3D printing technology enables the production of three-dimensional objects from digital design data through an additive manufacturing process, which builds up components in layers using materials that are available in fine powder form. 3D printers take advantage of improvements in computing power and motion and process control to deposit a range of materials, including metals, plastics and composite materials, accurately at high speed. Within metal-based 3D printing processes that include laser metal deposition (LMD) and selective laser melting (SLM), a laser beam is used to fuse metallic powder at points defined by computer-generated design data. In many metal-based 3D printers, multiple laser sources are used to fuse the metallic powder more quickly and at multiple angles. 3D printing permits highly complex structures, with a high degree of customization capability and significantly less waste than subtractive manufacturing processes. The trends toward automation and miniaturization, as well as the stability and reliability of our fiber lasers have played important roles in the development of additive manufacturing technology. 
Marking and Engraving.    With the increasing need for source traceability, component identification and product tracking as a means of reducing product liability and preventing falsification, as well as the demand for modern robotic production systems, manufacturers increasingly demand marking systems capable of applying serialized alphanumeric, graphic or bar code identifications directly onto their manufactured components. Laser engraving is similar to marking but forms deeper grooves in the material. In contrast to conventional acid etching and ink-based technologies, lasers can mark a wide variety of metal and non-metal materials, such as ceramic, glass and plastic surfaces, at high speeds and without contact by changing the surface structure of the material or by engraving. Laser marking systems can be easily integrated into a customer's production process and do not subject the item being marked to mechanical stress. Our ytterbium pulsed fiber lasers are used for these applications. In addition, we make high powered lasers for ablation and cleaning applications. 
In the semiconductor industry, lasers typically are used to mark wafers and integrated circuits. In the electronics industry, lasers typically are used to mark electrical components such as contactors, relays and printed circuit boards. Consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones, computers and handheld computers contain many parts that are laser-marked, including keyboards, logos and labels. With the increase in marking speed in the past few years, the cost of laser marking has decreased. In the photovoltaic or solar panel industry, pulsed lasers increasingly are used to remove materials and to scribe, or
Table of Contents

 cut, solar cells. The high beam quality, increased peak output powers, flexible fiber delivery and competitive price of fiber lasers have accelerated the adoption of fiber lasers in these low power applications. 
Micro-Processing and Fine Processing.    The trend toward miniaturization in numerous industries such as consumer electronics, as well as innovations in materials and structures, is driving end users to utilize lasers in processing and fabrication. The ability of lasers to cut, weld, drill, ablate, etch and add materials on a fine scale is enabling new technologies and products across many industries. Our low power CW and QCW lasers are used to cut medical stents and weld medical batteries. In photovoltaic manufacturing, our lasers etch and perform edge isolation processes. The aerospace industry requires precise manufacturing of engine parts so that cooling is effective and aerospace manufacturers use lasers to conduct percussion drilling. Processing of plastics and semi-conductors require short pulse and high energy lasers, in the green, UV and mid-IR wavelengths.

We design and manufacture enhanced optical transmission modules and systems and DWDM transport systems for transmission of multiple wavelength channels over a single optical fiber. 
We develop and make optical pluggable system-in-module transponders, based upon proprietary mixed signal ASIC proprietary designs, intended to simplify optical networks and reduce customer capital costs. These software-defined and configurable DWDM transponder modules are designed to operate at 100G direct detection and coherent transmission rates. Higher speed modules are under development. These products are deployed in data center operations and optical network systems.
IPG's fiber amplifiers are deployed in some of the world's largest broadband FTTH networks. In addition, we design and manufacture transceivers for interconnecting electronic equipment within telecommunications, cable MSO, and data center networks.
DWDM.    DWDM is a technology that expands the capacity of optical networks, allowing service providers to extend the life of existing fiber networks and reduce operating and capital costs by maximizing bandwidth capacity. We provide a DWDM transport system that offers service providers and private network operators a simple, flexible, optical layer solution scalable to 80 channels that aggregates and multiplexes multiprotocol clients into optical transport network signals operating from 10 to 600 gigabits per second per channel. We also provide both fixed wavelength DWDM transceivers and tunable DWDM transceivers that are capable of dynamically tuning across a range of wavelengths. We provide a broad range of high power products for DWDM applications including EDFAs and Raman lasers.

Broadband Access.    The delivery to subscribers of television programming and Internet-based information and communication services is converging, driven by advances in Internet Protocol ("IP") technology and by changes in the regulatory and competitive environment. Fiber optic lines now offer connection speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second to the subscriber, or 1,000 times faster than digital subscriber lines ("DSL"), or cable links. We offer a series of specialty multi-port EDFAs and cable television ("TV") nodes and transmitters that support different types of passive optical network architectures, enabling high-speed data, voice, video on demand and high-definition TV. We provide an EDFA that supports up to 64 output ports, which allows service providers to support a high number of customers in a small space, reducing overall power consumption and network cost. End users for our products include communications network operators for video wavelength division multiplexing overlay solutions, operators of metro and long-haul networks for DWDM and amplification solutions, as well as cable and multiple system operators for optical amplification solutions.
Medical
We sell our commercial fiber and diode lasers to OEMs that incorporate our products into their medical laser systems. Our ultrafast, CW and QCW ytterbium, erbium and thulium fiber lasers from 1 to 200 watts and diode laser systems can be used in various medical and biomedical applications. Aesthetic applications addressed by lasers include skin rejuvenation, hair removal, and treatment of pigmented and vascular lesions. Purchasers use our diode lasers in dental and skin rejuvenation procedures. Through our medical business, we are developing laser systems for dental (soft tissue and bone surgery) and surgical (benign prostatic hyperplasia and lithotripsy) aesthetic, and veterinary uses. Other medical procedures are also being investigated. 
Technology
Our products are based on our proprietary technology platform that we have developed and refined since our formation. The following technologies are key elements in our products.
Specialty Optical Fibers
We have extensive expertise in the disciplines and techniques that form the basis for the multi-clad active and passive optical fibers used in our products. Active optical fibers form the laser cavity or gain medium in which lasing or amplification of light occurs in our products. Passive optical fibers deliver the optical energy created in our products. Our active fibers consist of an inner core that is infused with the appropriate rare earth ion, such as ytterbium, erbium or thulium, and outer cores of un-doped glass having different indices of refraction. We believe that our large portfolio of specialty active and passive optical fibers has a number of advantages as compared to other commercially available optical fibers. These advantages include higher concentrations of rare earth ions, fibers that will not degrade at the high power levels over the useful life of the product, high lasing efficiency, ability to achieve single-mode outputs at high powers, ability to withstand high optical energies and temperatures and scalable side-pumping capability.
Semiconductor Diode Laser Processing and Packaging Technologies
Another key element of our technology platform is that we use multiple multi-mode, or broad area, single-emitter diodes rather than diode bars or stacks as a pump source. We believe that multi-mode single-emitter diodes are the most efficient and reliable pumping source presently available, surpassing diode bars and stacks in efficiency, brightness and reliability. Single-emitter diodes have substantially reduced cooling requirements and typically have long lifetimes at high operating currents, compared to typical lifetimes of diode bars. 
We developed advanced molecular beam epitaxy techniques to grow alumina indium gallium arsenide wafers for our diodes. This method yields high-quality optoelectronic material for low-defect density and high uniformity of optoelectronic parameters. In addition, we have developed numerous proprietary wafer processes and testing and qualification procedures in order to create a high energy output in a reliable and high power diode. We package our diodes in hermetically sealed pump modules in which the diodes are combined with an optical fiber output. Characteristics such as the ability of the package to dissipate heat produced by the diode and withstand vibration, shock, high temperature, humidity and other environmental conditions are critical to the reliability and efficiency of the products.
Specialty Components and Combining Techniques
We developed a wide range of advanced optical components that are capable of handling high optical power levels and contribute to the superior performance, efficiency and reliability of our products. In addition to fibers and diodes, our optical component portfolio includes fiber gratings, couplers, isolators, combiners, and crystals. We also developed special methods and expertise in splicing fibers together with low optical energy loss and on-line loss testing. We believe that our internal development and manufacturing of key optical components allows us to lower our manufacturing costs and improve product performance.

Side Pumping of Fibers and Fiber Block Technologies
Our technology platform allows us to efficiently combine a large number of multi-mode single-emitter semiconductor diodes with our active optical fibers that are used in all of our products. A key element of this technology is that we pump our fiber lasers through the cladding surrounding the active core. We splice our specialty active optical fibers with other optical components and package them in a sealed box, which we call a fiber block. The fiber blocks are compact and eliminate the risk of contamination or misalignment due to mechanical vibrations and shocks as well as temperature or humidity variations. Our design is scalable and modular, permitting us to make products with high output power by coupling a large number of diodes with fiber blocks, which can be combined in parallel and serially.
High-Stress Testing
We employ high-stress techniques in testing components and final products that help increase reliability and accelerate product development. For example, we test all of our diodes with high current and temperatures to accelerate aging. We also have built a large database of diode test results that allows us to predict the estimated lifetime of our diodes. This testing allows us to eliminate defective diodes prior to further assembly and thus increase reliability.
Customers
We sell our products globally to OEMs, system integrators and end users in a wide range of diverse markets who have the in-house engineering capability to integrate our products into their own systems. We also sell complete laser and non-laser solutions to end users for their production needs. We have thousands of customers worldwide. Our primary end market is materials processing, comprised of general manufacturing, automotive, heavy industry, aerospace, consumer products, medical device manufacturing, natural resources, photovoltaic, semiconductor and electronics. We estimate that in 2018, approximately 57%, 16% and 9% of our net sales were generated from sales for cutting, welding and brazing, and marking and engraving applications, respectively. In 2017, approximately 54%, 20% and 9% and in 2016, approximately 51%, 18% and 11% of our net sales were generated from sales for cutting, welding and brazing, and marking and engraving applications, respectively. These estimates are based upon customer information and when customer information has not been provided, upon our best information and belief. Within each of these applications, the lasers may vary substantially in terms of output powers depending upon the types of materials processed (e.g., thick steel cutting, aluminum cutting and fine metal cutting) and the industry served within the diverse materials processing end market, some of which are listed above. We also sell our products to other end markets, including advanced applications (comprised of commercial companies, universities, research entities and government entities), communications (comprised of system integrators, utilities and municipalities) and medical (comprised of medical laser systems manufacturers and researchers). We believe that our customer, geographic and end market diversification minimizes dependence on any single industry or group of customers.
The following table shows the allocation of our net sales (in thousands) among our principal markets:

 | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | 
 | 2018 | | | | 2017 | | | | 2016 | | 
 | | | % of Total | | | | % of Total | | | | 
Materials processing | $ | 1,374,448 | | 94.1 | % | | $ | 1,332,607 | | 94.6 | % | $ | 942,119 | 93.6 | %
Other applications | 85,426 | | 5.9 | | | 76,282 | | 5.4 | | | 64,054 | 6.4 | 
Total | $ | 1,459,874 | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 1,408,889 | | 100.0 | % | $ | 1,006,173 | 100.0 | %

One of our customers, Han's Laser, headquartered in China, accounted for 12%, 13% and 9% of our net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in 2018, 2017 or 2016. 
Backlog
At December 31, 2018, our backlog of orders (generally scheduled for shipment within one year) was approximately $712.3 million compared to $743.6 million at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, our backlog included $338.7 million of orders with firm shipment dates and $373.6 million of frame agreements that we expect to ship within one year, compared to $326.1 million of orders with firm shipment dates and $417.4 million of frame agreements at December 31, 2017. Frame agreements are non-binding indications of customer pricing and volume levels but are not firm customer purchase obligations. Orders used to compute backlog are generally cancellable without substantial penalties. Historically, we have not experienced a significant cancellation rate in ordinary economic conditions. We manage the risk of cancellation by establishing the right to charge a cancellation fee that generally covers a portion of the purchase price, any materials and development costs incurred prior to the order being canceled. Our ability to enforce this right depends on many factors including, but not limited to, the customer's requested length of delay, the number of other outstanding orders with the customer and our ability to quickly convert the canceled order to another sale.

We anticipate shipping a substantial majority of the present backlog during fiscal year 2019. However, our backlog at any given date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future period.
Sales, Marketing and Support
We market our products internationally primarily through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force sells to end users, OEMs and systems integrators. Once our fiber laser products are designed into an OEMs' system, the OEM's sales force markets its systems, allowing us to take advantage of numerous OEMs' sales forces, each typically having several sales persons in locations other than where our sales offices are located. We have sales offices in the countries in which we have major manufacturing: United States, Germany and Russia. 
We also have sales and service offices in the following countries: Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey and the United Kingdom. We have materials processing application centers in the United States, Germany, Russia, China, Italy, Japan and South Korea, which we use to demonstrate our products and develop new applications. Our application centers are fundamental to developing new laser applications for customers and assisting them in integrating lasers into their production processes.
To a lesser extent, we market through agreements with independent sales representatives and distributors. Sales to foreign customers may be priced in non-U.S. currencies and are therefore subject to currency exchange fluctuations.
We maintain a customer support and field service staff in our major markets. We work closely with customers and independent representatives to service equipment and to train customers to use our products. We have expanded our support and field service, particularly in locations where customer concentration or volume requires local service capabilities. We repair products at our facilities or at customer sites.
We typically provide one to three-year parts and service warranties on our lasers and amplifiers. Most of our sales offices provide support to customers in their respective geographic areas. Warranty reserves have generally been sufficient to cover product warranty repair and replacement costs.
Manufacturing
Vertical integration is one of our core business strategies through which we control our proprietary processes and technologies as well as the supply of key components and assemblies. We believe that our vertically integrated business model gives us the following advantages:
•maintaining a technological lead over competitors;
•reducing component and final product costs compared to market prices available to competitors;
•ensuring access to critical components, enabling us to better meet customer demands;
•controlling performance, quality and consistency;
•enabling rapid development and deployment of new products and technologies; 
•short lead times for customer deliveries; and 
•limiting the spread our trade secrets.
Our vertically integrated manufacturing operations include optical preform making, specialty fiber drawing, semiconductor wafer growth, diode processing and packaging, specialty optical component manufacturing, fiber block and fiber module assembly for different power units, circuit board, software and electronics development and production, crystal growth, cleaning and polishing, machining of metal parts and casings and final assembly of finished product. In addition we make some of the testing, tool manufacturing and automated production systems that we use in our own manufacturing processes. Over the last several years, we added additional production capabilities, including multi-wafer growth reactors, diode test stations, fiber pre-form and fiber drawing equipment and low, mid and high power laser production and testing, in order to increase our capacity as well as reduce the risks associated with our production process.
We operate our own semiconductor foundry for the production of the multi-mode single-emitter diodes. Diodes are the pumps that are used as the light source in each device we make. We also process, package and extensively test all of our diodes. Because pump diodes represent a significant component cost of the final laser or amplifier, we have developed internal manufacturing capabilities for diodes. As a result of our high-volume production levels of pump diodes, proprietary processes and use of a small number of chip designs, we have been able to increase yields, lower component costs and assure high quality. We also design, manufacture and optimize many of our own test instruments, diode test racks, robotic and automated assembly tools and machines.

We developed proprietary components and accessories, manufacturing tools, equipment and techniques over many years in an effort to address the major issues that had been inhibiting the development of fiber laser technology and to provide products that differentiate us from our competitors. In addition, we have acquired additional components including volume Bragg gratings. We believe that the proprietary components, manufacturing tools, equipment, techniques and software utilized in all of our product lines provide extensive barriers to potential competitors. Generally, we do not sell our proprietary components to third parties in significant quantities. Using our technology platform, we configure standard laser and amplifier products based upon each customer's specifications. Through our vertically integrated manufacturing operations, we believe that we can develop, test and produce new products and configurations with higher performance and reliability and in less time than by working with external vendors. We have developed proprietary testing methodologies that allow us to develop higher power components and products in short periods of time, enable us to introduce products to the market more quickly, capitalize on new opportunities and provide superior service to our customers.
In our materials process systems business, we manufacture standard configuration systems which we also customize for specific customer requirements. 
Our in-house manufacturing generally includes those operations and components that are critical to the protection of our intellectual property, the reduction of our costs or the achievement of performance and quality standards. We purchase from vendors common and specialized mechanical, electrical and optical parts and raw materials.
Research and Development
We have extensive research and development experience in laser materials, fiber, optoelectronic and optomechanical components. We have assembled a team of scientists and engineers with specialized experience and extensive knowledge in fiber lasers and amplifiers, materials science, optics, critical components, testing and manufacturing process design, and laser application development.
We focus our research and development efforts on designing and introducing new and improved standard and customized products and complementary products, and the mass production of components for our products. In addition to our cladding-pumped specialty fiber platform, we have core competencies in high power multi-mode and single-mode semiconductor laser diodes, diode packaging, specialty active and passive optical fibers, high-performance optical components, crystal growth and processing, fiber gain blocks and fiber modules, thin film optical coatings, as well as splicing and combining techniques and high-stress test methods. Our research and development efforts are aided by our vertical integration and our proprietary high-stress testing techniques that result in accelerated development cycles. The strategy of developing our proprietary components has allowed us to leverage our optical experience and large volume requirements to lower the cost of our products. 
Our research and development efforts are also directed at expanding our product line by increasing power levels, improving beam quality and electrical efficiency, decreasing the size of our products and lowering the cost per watt. We also are engaged in research projects to expand the spectral range of products that we offer, including the development of UV pulsed fiber lasers, ultrafast pulsed fiber lasers, and a mid-IR line of lasers from 2 to 5 microns, with a hybrid fiber and crystal laser design. We are also investing our research and development funds on laser systems, products for medical applications, and telecommunications products and components. Our team of experienced scientists and engineers work closely with many of our customers to develop and introduce custom products and laser processing that address specific applications and performance requirements.
We incurred research and development costs of approximately $122.8 million, $100.9 million and $78.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect to continue our commitment to research and development and to introduce new products, systems and complementary products that would allow us to maintain our competitive position. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition of Results of Operations."
Intellectual Property
We seek to protect our proprietary technology primarily through the U.S. and foreign laws affording protection for trade secrets, and to seek U.S. and foreign patent, copyright and trademark protection of our products and processes where appropriate. Historically, we relied primarily on trade secrets, technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, in part, by requiring our employees to enter into agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and the assignment to us of rights to inventions that they make while we employ them. We also enter into non-disclosure agreements with our consultants and suppliers to protect confidential information delivered to them. We believe that our vertical integration, including our extensive experience in making a wide range of specialty and high power capacity components, as well as our technology platform make it difficult for others to reverse engineer our products.
Table of Contents

We have increased our efforts to expand our patent portfolio globally. As of December 31, 2018, we have over 350 patents issued and over 430 pending patent applications worldwide relating principally to optical fiber lasers, amplifiers, bulk optics, semiconductors, laser and telecommunications systems and applications of fiber lasers. With respect to the United States, we were issued 14 patents and we filed 27 applications containing new subject matter in 2018. Intellectual property rights, including those that we own, those that we license and those of others, involve significant risks. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Our Inability to Protect Our Intellectual Property and Proprietary Technologies Could Result in the Unauthorized Use of Our Technologies by Third Parties, Hurt Our Competitive Position and Adversely Affect Our Operating Results."
Competition
Our markets are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, continuously evolving customer requirements, and reduced average selling prices over time. We believe that the primary competitive factors in our markets are:
•product performance and reliability;
•quality and service support;
•price and value to the customer;
•ability to manufacture and deliver products on a timely basis;
•ability to achieve qualification for and integration into OEM systems;
•ability to meet customer specifications; and
•ability to respond quickly to market demand and technological developments.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to these criteria. In the materials processing market, the competition is fragmented and includes a large number of competitors. We compete with makers of fiber lasers, solid-state lasers, direct diode lasers, high power CO2, YAG and disc lasers. These include public and private companies such as Coherent, Inc., Laserline GmbH, Lumentum Holdings Inc., Maxphotonics Co., Ltd., nLight, Inc., Raycus Fiber Laser Technologies Co. Ltd., and Trumpf GmbH + Co. KG, as well as other smaller competitors. Our current or potential customers may determine to develop and produce products for their own use which are competitive to our products. Such vertical integration could reduce the market opportunity for our products. Many of our fiber laser competitors are increasing the output powers of their fiber lasers to compete with our products.
We also compete in the materials processing, advanced and medical applications markets with end users that produce their own solid-state and gas lasers as well as with manufacturers of non-laser methods and tools, such as traditional non-laser welding and cutting dies in the materials processing market and scalpels in the medical market.
Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial, managerial and technical resources, more extensive distribution and service networks, greater sales and marketing capacity, and larger installed customer bases than we do.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 6,220 full-time employees, including 670 in research and development, 4,820 in manufacturing operations, 300 in sales, service and marketing, and 430 in general and administrative functions. Of our total full-time employees at our principal facilities, approximately 2,340 were in the United States, 1,300 were in Germany, 1,740 were in Russia and 220 were in China. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our current relations with our employees are good. We also have approximately 245 independent contractors worldwide who are principally used in manufacturing operations.
Seasonality
Our net sales have historically fluctuated from quarter to quarter. The increase or decrease in sales from a prior quarter can be affected by the timing of orders received from customers, the shipment, installation and acceptance of products at our customers' facilities, the mix of OEM orders and one-time orders for products with large purchase prices, competitive pressures, acquisitions, economic and political conditions in a certain country or region and seasonal factors such as the purchasing patterns and levels of activity throughout the year in the regions where we operate. Historically, our net sales have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although that trend did not occur in 2018 due to a decrease in capital equipment spending in Europe and China caused by slower macro-economic growth and uncertainty caused by the trade war between the United States and China. Net sales can be affected by the time taken to qualify our products for use in new applications in the end markets that we serve. The adoption of our products by a new customer or qualification in a new
Table of Contents

 application can lead to an increase in net sales for a period, which may then slow until we penetrate new markets or obtain new customers.
Government Regulation
Regulatory Compliance
The majority of our laser and amplifier products sold in the United States are classified as Class IV Laser Products under the applicable rules and regulations of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health ("CDRH") of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). The same classification system is applied in the European markets. Safety rules are formulated with "Deutsche Industrie Norm" (i.e., German Industrial Standards) or International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") standards, which are internationally harmonized.
CDRH regulations generally require a self-certification procedure pursuant to which a manufacturer must submit a filing to the CDRH with respect to each product incorporating a laser device, make periodic reports of sales and purchases and comply with product labeling standards, product safety and design features and informational requirements. The CDRH is empowered to seek fines and other remedies for violations of their requirements. We believe that our products are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to the manufacture of laser devices.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including those relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal, product composition and labeling of, human exposure to and hazardous and toxic materials. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental protection laws and regulations. Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business.
We face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of environmental compliance regulations and standards, as well as specific customer compliance requirements. These regulations and standards have an impact on the material composition of our products entering specific markets. Such legislation has gone into effect at various times across worldwide markets. For example, in the European Union ("EU"), the Restriction of the use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) went into effect in 2006, and was subsequently revised in 2011 (as RoHS 2) and again in 2015 (as RoHS 2 amended) and will be in effect in 2019. The Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) went into effect in 2007, and is updated with additional substances every 6 months. China enacted the Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation (China-RoHS) in 2007, which was revised and renamed in 2016 as the Administrative Measures for the Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products (known as China RoHS 2). Another example is the US Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Conflict Minerals Act) which requires manufacturers to provide disclosures about the use of specified conflict minerals emanating from the DRC and nine adjoining countries (Covered Countries). In addition to these regulations and directives, we may face costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation. For example, beginning in 2006 (with several subsequent revisions), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive 2012/19/EU made producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, recovery, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. Similar laws are now pending in various jurisdictions around the world, including the United States.
