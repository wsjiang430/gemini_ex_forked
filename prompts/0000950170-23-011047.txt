 Item 1. Business.
Overview
 Until recently, we were a fully-integrated, clinical stage precision oncology biopharmaceutical company. On January 9, 2023, we announced, after extensive consideration of potential strategic alternatives, that our Board of Directors had unanimously approved the dissolution and liquidation of Calithera pursuant to a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution, or the Plan of Dissolution, subject to stockholder approval. In connection with the Plan of Dissolution, we began discontinuing all clinical programs and commenced reducing our workforce, which includes the planned termination of most employees by the end of the first quarter, and began the wind-up of our operations. We are currently seeking to sell all of our clinical assets and programs.
In light of our planned dissolution, on January 24, 2023, we received written notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, advising us that based upon Nasdaq’s review and pursuant to Listing Rule 5101, Nasdaq believed that we were a “public shell,” and that the continued listing of our securities was no longer warranted. As a result, the trading of our common stock was suspended as of the opening of business on February 2, 2023, and on March 3, 2023, Nasdaq filed a Form 25-NSE with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, which removed our common stock from listing and registration on Nasdaq.
Clinical Assets and Programs
 Sapanisertib (CB-228) and Mivavotinib (CB-659)
 In October 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or APA, with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Millennium, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to acquire two clinical-stage compounds, both of which have demonstrated single-agent clinical activity in biomarker-defined cancer patient populations. The compounds are the TORC1/2 inhibitor sapanisertib (CB-228) and the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor mivavotinib (CB-659). We were conducting phase 2 trials of sapanisertib in NRF2-mutated sqNSCLC and mivavotinib in relapsed or refractory non-GCB (ABC) DLBCL with enrichment of MYD88/CD79b mutated tumors and in January 2023 began discontinuing these two programs.
CD73 Inhibitor CB-708 (ATG037) for Oncology
 A highly potent, selective, orally-bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of CD73, CB-708 (now ATG-037) was discovered by Calithera. In May 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Antengene Investment Limited, or Antengene, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Antengene Corporation, where we granted Antengene an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize CB-708 (now ATG-037). Under the terms of the license agreement, we received an upfront payment of $3.0 million in May 2021 and may receive potential development, regulatory and sales milestone of up to $252.0 million. Additionally, we were eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of licensed product up to low double-digits. In January 2023, we entered into an Assignment Agreement with Antengene, and Antengene acquired all the outstanding rights of CB-708 (now ATG-037).
Synthetic Lethality Preclinical Pipeline and VPS4A Inhibitors
 We were building a preclinical pipeline of synthetic lethality targets with a focus on paralog genes. We identified a novel series of small molecule inhibitors of VPS4A and VPS4B and were advancing multiple series through lead optimization.
Arginase Inhibitor for Cystic Fibrosis (CB-280)
 We were developing CB-280, a novel oral inhibitor of arginase that was being evaluated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or CF. We completed a Phase 1b trial in early 2022.
Arginase Inhibitor for Oncology (INCB001158)
 An additional arginase inhibitor, INCB001158, was discovered by Calithera and was being developed by Incyte Corporation for oncology and hematology indications. In January 2017, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Incyte, and in September 2022, Incyte notified us of its intent to terminate this agreement for convenience, which was effective on December 28, 2022. No material early termination penalties were payable by either party.
Glutaminase Inhibitor Telaglenastat (CB-839)
 In November 2021, we announced the discontinuation of the phase 2 telaglenastat KEAPSAKE clinical trial in patients with non-squamous cell lung carcinomas with genetic mutations in KEAP1/NRF2 based on a lack of clinical benefit observed in patients treated with telaglenastat in an interim analysis. In March 2023, we entered into an asset purchase agreement and sold all the assets and rights related to the telaglenastat program to an unrelated third party.
 Intellectual Property
Our policy was to seek to protect our intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the technology, inventions and improvements that were important to the development and implementation of our business strategy. We also relied on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 We filed patent applications directed to our product candidates, preclinical compounds, and related technologies to establish intellectual property positions on these compounds and their uses in treating disease. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 26 issued U.S. patents, 165 issued foreign patents, and approximately 93 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We expect that these patents and patent applications, if issued, would expire between November 2025 and October 2041.
 Our dual TORC 1/2 inhibitor patent portfolio includes patents and applications owned by us and patents and applications exclusively licensed from The Regents of the University of California. As of December 31, 2022, it included eight issued U.S. patents. These patents claim compositions of matter for, methods of treating cancer with, and methods of synthesizing CB-228 and related compounds. They also claim methods of treating certain cancers using CB-228 at particular dosages, and methods of combining CB-228 with other compounds to treat certain cancers. In the United States, the composition of matter patents are expected to expire between April 2027 and April 2031. We also have 59 issued foreign patents, two pending U.S. patent applications and three pending foreign patent applications directed to compositions of matter for CB-228 and related compounds, as well as methods of using these compounds. We expect that the claims to composition of matter within these patents and patent applications, if issued, would expire between November 2025 and August 2032.
 Our SYK inhibitor intellectual property portfolio is wholly owned by us and as of December 31, 2022, included five issued U.S. patents and two U.S. patent applications covering the composition for and methods of using CB-659 and related compounds. The U.S. patents relating to the composition of matter for CB-659 are expected to expire between March 2031 and April 2036. We also own 60 related foreign patents and 26 related foreign pending patent applications. We expect that these foreign patents and patent applications, if issued, would expire between December 2030 and December 2035.
The intellectual property portfolio for our arginase inhibitor program, which includes INCB001158 and CB-280, includes issued patents and pending patent applications that we have exclusively licensed from Symbioscience as well as issued patents and pending patent applications that we own. This portfolio includes 20 issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent applications, 62 corresponding pending foreign patent applications, and 99 issued foreign patents directed to various arginase inhibitors, therapeutic methods of using the compounds, methods of making the compounds, and intermediates useful in preparing the compounds. We expect that these patents and patent applications, if issued, would expire between April 2031 and May 2038.
 Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We previously obtained our supplies from manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have any long-term arrangements. In addition, we do not currently have arrangements in place for bulk drug substance or drug product services of any of our clinical supplies.
Research and Development
 In the ordinary course of business, we entered into agreements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our clinical trials and aspects of our research and preclinical testing. These third parties provided project management and monitoring services and regulatory consulting and investigative services. We are currently in the process of terminating these agreements, and have established reserves in connection with such termination.
Human Capital Resources
As of March 15, 2023, we had 8 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Facilities
We occupy approximately 34,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in South San Francisco, California. Our lease term is through January 2024.
Legal Proceedings
 From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Our management believes that there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
