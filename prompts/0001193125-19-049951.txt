Our Company 
 We are a leading home and security products company that competes in attractive long-term growth markets in our product categories. With a foundation of market-leading brands across a diversified mix of channels, and lean and flexible supply chains, as well as a tradition of strong product innovation and customer service, we are focused on outperforming our markets in both growth and returns, and driving increased shareholder value. We have three business segments: Cabinets, Plumbing, and Doors & Security. We sell our products through a wide array of sales channels, including kitchen and bath dealers, wholesalers oriented toward builders or professional remodelers, industrial and locksmith distributors, do-it-yourself remodeling-oriented home centers and other retail outlets. We believe the Companys impressive track record reflects the long-term attractiveness and potential of our categories and our leading brands. Despite increased pressures driven in part by tariffs, higher interest rates and inflation, our performance demonstrates the strength of our operating model and our ability to generate profitable growth as sales volume increases and we leverage our structural competitive advantages to gain share in our categories. 
Our Strategy 
 Build on leading business and brand positions in attractive growth and return categories.    We believe that we have leading market positions and brands in many of our product categories. In 2018, we expanded into the outdoor living market by acquiring Fiber Composites LLC (Fiberon), a leading U.S. manufacturer of outdoor performance materials used in decking, railing and fencing products. The acquisition of Fiberon provides category expansion and product extension opportunities into the outdoor living space for our Doors & Security segment. We continue to invest in targeted advertising and other strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing brand awareness and educating 
 
1 


  consumers regarding the breadth, features and benefits of our product lines. For example, in the third quarter of 2018, Moen launched its new Who designs for water advertising and brand campaign showcasing its appreciation for Earths most crucial resource, while inspiring consumers to look at water from a renewed viewpoint. We also strive to leverage our brands by expanding into adjacent product categories and continue to develop new programs by working closely with our customers.
Continue to develop innovative products for customers, designers, installers and consumers.    Sustained investments in consumer-driven product innovation and customer service, along with our low cost structures, have contributed to our success in the marketplace and creating consumer demand. In 2018, our Global Plumbing Group developed partnerships and investments in the whole home water space, including partnering with Flo Technologies. In 2018, MasterBrand Cabinets, which provides a wide range of cabinets for the home, launched innovative new cabinet door designs, lighting systems, color palettes and features in a range of styles that allows consumers to create a custom kitchen look at an affordable price and introduced new, exclusive laminate door and finish options across multiple price segments. We continue to provide channel support with responsive websites featuring our cabinet brands that drives consumers to our partner dealers. The Therma-Tru portfolio of on-trend door and glass collections continued to evolve to meet current and emerging architectural design trends including wider and taller door styles, expanding panel configurations, as well as additional decorative, privacy and textured glass designs. Master Lock continued to be an innovation leader in security and safety products and services, driven by consumer and end user focused insights with continued emphasis on electronic enabled solutions for enhanced capability and convenience. In 2018, we launched our Vault Enterprise software and suite of Bluetooth® enabled hardware for business, providing a convenient way for companies to control access, manage assets and improve accountability across many users simultaneously. SentrySafe continued to provide a full line portfolio of quality security, fire and water resistant safes to help consumers and small business owners protect documents and valuables. 
 Expand in international markets.    We expect to have opportunities to expand sales by further penetrating international markets, which represented approximately 16% of net sales in 2018. We continue to develop our relationship with dealers and distributors and their Moen-branded stores throughout China. In our Cabinets segment, Kitchen Craft remained a leading cabinetry brand in Canada, while WoodCrafters provided a company presence in Mexico. Within our Doors & Security segment, Master Lock continued to expand its presence in Europe and Asia, while Therma-Tru made inroads in Canada as consumers transitioned from traditional entry door materials to more advanced and energy-efficient fiberglass doors. 
 Leverage our global supply chains.    We are using lean manufacturing, design-to-manufacture and distributive assembly techniques to make our supply chains more flexible and improve supply chain quality, cost, response times and asset efficiency. We view our global supply chains and manufacturing presence as a strategic asset not only to support strong operating leverage as volumes increase, but also to enable the profitable growth of new products, adjacent market expansion and international growth. 
 Enhance returns and deploy our cash flow to high-return opportunities.    We continue to believe our most attractive opportunities are to invest in profitable organic growth initiatives, pursue accretive strategic acquisitions, non-controlling equity investments, and joint ventures, and return cash to stockholders through a combination of dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. In 2018, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares of our outstanding common stock under the Companys share repurchase programs for $695 million. In September 2018, we acquired Fiberon providing category expansion and product extension opportunities into the outdoor living space for our Doors & Security segment. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe our competitive strengths include the following: 
 Leading brands.    We have leading brands in many of our product categories. We believe that established brands are meaningful to both consumers and trade customers in their respective categories 
 
2 


  and that we have the opportunity to, among other things, continue to expand many of our brands into adjacent product categories and international markets. 
 Strategic focus on attractive consumer-facing categories.    We believe we operate in categories that, while very competitive, are among the more attractive categories in the home products and security products markets. Some of the key characteristics that make these categories attractive in our view include the following: 
 

> | product quality, innovation, fashion, finish, durability and functionality, which are key determinants of product selection in addition to price;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | established brands, which are meaningful to both consumers and trade customers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | the opportunity to add value to a complex consumer purchasing decision with excellent service propositions, reliability of products, ease of installation and superior delivery lead times;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------

 Operational excellence.    In 2018, we invested approximately $45 million to support long-term growth potential both in the U.S. and international markets. In addition, our supply chains and low cost manufacturing structures allow us to adapt to challenging market conditions. We believe that margin improvement will continue to be driven predominantly by organic volume growth that can be readily accommodated by current production capacity. 
 Commitment to innovation.    We have a long track record of successful product and process innovations that introduce valued new products and services to our customers and consumers. We are committed to continuing to invest in new product development and enhance customer service to strengthen our leading brands and penetrate adjacent markets. 
 Diverse sales end-use mix.    We sell in a variety of product categories and sales channels in the U.S. home and security products markets. In addition, our exposure to changing levels of U.S. residential new home construction activity is balanced with repair-and-remodel activity, which comprised a substantial majority of the overall U.S. home products market and about two-thirds of our U.S. home products sales in 2018. We also benefit from a stable market for plumbing and security products and international sales growth opportunities. 
 Diverse sales channels.    We sell through a wide array of sales channels, including kitchen and bath dealers, wholesalers oriented to builders or professional remodelers, industrial and locksmith distributors, do-it-yourself remodeling-oriented home centers and other retail outlets. We also sell security products to locksmiths, industrial distributors and mass merchants. We are able to leverage these existing sales channels to expand into adjacent product categories. In 2018, sales to our top ten customers represented less than half of total sales. 
 Decentralized business model.    Our business segments are focused on distinct product categories and are responsible for their own performance. This structure enables each of our segments to independently best position itself within each category in which it competes and reinforces strong accountability for operational and financial performance. Each of our segments focuses on its unique set of consumers, customers, competitors and suppliers, while also sharing best practices.

 Strong capital structure.    We exited 2018 with a strong balance sheet. In 2018, we repurchased 12.0 million of our shares. As of December 31, 2018, we had $262.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and total debt was $2,334.0 million, resulting in a net debt position of $2,071.1 million. In addition, we had $930.0 million available under our credit facility as of December 31, 2018. 
 Business Segments 
 In July 2018, we publicly announced an internal reorganization to combine our Doors and Security segments under common leadership to drive innovation, accelerate product development, and enhance investments and business processes for the combined segment. In conjunction with the reorganization, we changed how our chief operating decision maker evaluates and allocates the resources across our businesses. As a result, beginning in the third quarter of 2018, we have three business segments: Cabinets, Plumbing and Doors & Security. The following table shows net sales for each of these segments and key brands within each segment: 

Segment | 2018Net Sales(in millions) | | Percentage ofTotal 2018Net Sales | | Key Brands
Cabinets | $ | 2,418.6 | | 44 | % | Diamond, Aristokraft, Mid-Continent, Kitchen Craft, Homecrest, Omega, Ultracraft, StarMark, Schrock, Decora, Kemper
Plumbing | | 1,883.3 | | 34 | % | Moen, ROHL, Riobel, Perrin & Rowe, Victoria + Albert, Shaws 
Doors & Security | | 1,183.2 | | 22 | % | Master Lock, American Lock, SentrySafe, Therma-Tru, Fypon, Fiberon 
Total | $ | 5,485.1 | | 100 | % | 

 Our segments compete on the basis of innovation, fashion, quality, price, service and responsiveness to distributor, retailer and installer needs, as well as end-user consumer preferences. Our markets are very competitive. Approximately 16% of 2018 net sales were to international markets, and sales to two of the Companys customers, The Home Depot, Inc. (The Home Depot) and Lowes Companies, Inc. (Lowes), each accounted for more than 10% of the Companys net sales in 2018. Sales to all U.S. home centers in the aggregate were approximately 26% of net sales in 2018. 
 Cabinets.    Our Cabinets segment manufactures custom, semi-custom and stock cabinetry, as well as vanities, for the kitchen, bath and other parts of the home through a regional supply chain footprint to deliver high quality cabinets and service to our customers. This segment sells a portfolio of brands that enables our customers to differentiate themselves against competitors. This portfolio includes brand names such as Aristokraft, Diamond, Mid-Continent, Kitchen Craft, Schrock, Homecrest, Omega, Thomasville, Kemper, StarMark and Ultracraft. Substantially all of this segments sales are in North America. This segment sells directly to kitchen and bath dealers, home centers, wholesalers and large builders. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowes comprised approximately 36% of net sales of the Cabinets segment in 2018. This segments competitors include Masco and American Woodmark, as well as a large number of overseas, regional and local suppliers. 
 Plumbing.    Our Plumbing segment manufactures or assembles and sells faucets, accessories, kitchen sinks and waste disposals, predominantly under the Moen, ROHL, Riobel, Perrin & Rowe, Victoria + Albert and Shaws brands. Although this segment sells products principally in the U.S., China and Canada, this segment also sells in Mexico, Southeast Asia, Europe and South America. Approximately 28% of 2018 net sales were to international markets. This segment sells directly through its own sales force and indirectly through independent manufacturers representatives, primarily to wholesalers, home centers, mass merchandisers and industrial distributors. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowes comprised approximately 23% of net sales of the Plumbing segment in 2018. This segments chief competitors include

  Masco, Kohler, Spectrum Brands, LIXIL Group, InSinkErator (owned by Emerson Electronic Company) and imported private-label brands. 
 Doors & Security.    Our Doors & Security segment manufactures and sells fiberglass and steel entry door systems under the Therma-Tru brand name, composite decking, railing and fencing under the Fiberon brand name, and urethane millwork under the Fypon brand name. It also manufactures, sources and distributes locks, safety and security devices, and electronic security products under the Master Lock brand and fire resistant safes, security containers and commercial cabinets under the SentrySafe brand. This segment sells products principally in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Central America, Japan and Australia. Approximately 14% of 2018 net sales were to international markets. This segments principal customers are home centers, hardware and other retailers, millwork building products and wholesale distributors, and specialty dealers that provide products to the residential new construction market, as well as to the remodeling and renovation markets. In addition, it sells lock systems and fire resistant safes to locksmiths, industrial and institutional users, and original equipment manufacturers. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowes comprised approximately 19% of net sales of the Doors & Security segment in 2018. Therma-Tru, Fiberon and Fypon brands compete with Masonite, JELD-WEN, Trex, Azek, Plastpro, Pella and various regional and local suppliers. The Master Lock brand competes with Abus, W.H. Brady, Hampton, Spectrum Brands, Allegion, Assa Abloy and various imports. SentrySafe brands compete with Magnum, Fortress, Interlocks and Stack-On.
Annual net sales for each of the last three fiscal years for each of our business segments were as follows: 
 

(In millions) | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016
Cabinets | $ | 2,418.6 | | $ | 2,467.1 | | $ | 2,397.8
Plumbing | | 1,883.3 | | | 1,720.8 | | | 1,534.4
Doors & Security | | 1,183.2 | | | 1,095.4 | | | 1,052.7
Total | $ | 5,485.1 | | $ | 5,283.3 | | $ | 4,984.9

 For additional financial information for each of our business segments, refer to Note 19, Information on Business Segments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Information 
 Raw materials.    The table below indicates the principal raw materials used by each of our segments. These materials are available from a number of sources. Volatility in the prices of commodities and energy used in making and distributing our products impacts the cost of manufacturing our products. 

Segment | Raw Materials 
Cabinets | Hardwoods (maple, cherry and oak), plywood and particleboard 
Plumbing | Brass, zinc, resins, stainless steel, aluminum and copper 
Doors & Security | Steel, resins, glass, wood, aluminum, insulating foam, brass and zinc

 Intellectual property.    Product innovation and branding are important to the success of our business. In addition to the brand protection offered by our trademarks, patent protection helps distinguish our unique product features in the market by preventing copying and making it more difficult for competitors to benefit unfairly from our design innovation. We hold U.S. and foreign patents covering various features used in products sold within all of our business segments. Although each of our segments relies on a number of patents and patent groups that, in the aggregate, provide important protections to the Company, no single patent or patent group is material to any of the Companys segments.

 Employees.    As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 25,300 full-time employees. Approximately 3,200 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employee relations are generally good. 
 Seasonality.    All of our operating segments traditionally experience lower sales in the first quarter of the year when new home construction, repair-and-remodel activity and security buying are at their lowest. As a result of sales seasonality and associated timing of working capital fluctuations, our cash flow from operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the year. 
 Environmental matters.    We are involved in remediation activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop estimates of environmental remediation exposures. Some of the potential liabilities relate to sites we own, and some relate to sites we no longer own or never owned. Several of our subsidiaries have been designated as potentially responsible parties (PRP) under Superfund or similar state laws. As of December 31, 2018, ten such instances have not been dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. In 2018, none of our subsidiaries were identified as a PRP in a new instance and no instances were settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. In most instances where our subsidiaries are named as a PRP, we enter into cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance for PRP costs. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other PRPs or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had accruals of $0.6 and $0.7 million, respectively, relating to environmental compliance and cleanup including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites.
