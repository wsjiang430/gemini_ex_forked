Company Overview
 
We are a communications software innovator developing enhanced security and privacy solutions for video, voice, and text applications and data transmission. Our offerings target consumer, government and enterprise clients. Using multi-layered encryption, blockchain technology and other recent innovations, we are developing our proprietary PeerStream Protocol (“PSP”) to offer clients maximal data security and confidentiality over distributed or decentralized networks. We also recently launched our Backchannel product suite in private beta, which includes cross platform applications, middleware and software development kits (“SDKs”) designed to offer a highly secure end user communication experience when coupled with PSP. For 20 years, we have built and continue to operate innovative consumer applications, including Paltalk and Camfrog, two of the largest live video social communities. The Company has a long history of technology innovation and holds 26 patents. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2005. Our principal executive office is located at 122 East 42nd Street, Suite 2600, New York, New York 10168.
 
Our Services and Products
 
Secure Communications Software Licensing
 
On March 8, 2018, we launched our proprietary software business, centered around the development of PSP and Backchannel. These efforts are supported by nearly 20 years of multimedia streaming expertise and a battle-tested technology platform that has facilitated the delivery of billions of multimedia messages to hundreds of millions of users. We believe we have the experience and ability to support corporate and government clients in integrating PSP and Backchannel to power highly secure communications of voice video and data with controls for privacy and confidentiality over networks that would otherwise provide an insecure environment.
How PSP Works. PSP is a configurable software solution designed to provide maximal data security and confidentiality for multimedia communications that is offered to enterprise and government agencies whose computing networks operate on distributed or geographically decentralized environments. PSP’s binary streaming and routing protocol is primarily designed to provide real-time data streaming and messaging channels for applications and devices that require the transmission of sensitive data or multi-point communications, emphasizing management of the identity of the sender and receiver, confidentiality of the transmitted content and configurable controls for administrators.
 
PSP supports several security features that we believe exceed what is commonly available in the market today. For example, PSP supports end-to-end encryption, which permits only the sender and recipient to encrypt and decrypt messages. However, end-to-end encryption does not provide a complete communications security solution, since routing and storing content and IP addresses are all points of vulnerability. Accordingly, we have designed PSP to add incremental innovations that address the security of the data transport process, providing successive layers of encryption with each network node traversed in transit. Furthermore, by adding a variation of “Onion Routing” virtual circuitry, which is a technique for encapsulating messages in layers of encryption similar to the layers of an onion, the path of communications on the PSP network is obfuscated from the point of origin to the destination, further masking the addressable identities. The communications are all ephemeral and servers in the network are blind to the full path of the communication, permitting security minded clients to operate in a “zero trust environment,” or an environment with safety measures that preserve security without relying on owned, controlled or even trusted network nodes. We believe in the aggregate the capabilities of PSP greatly reduce the risk of cloning, eavesdropping and wiretapping privileged and confidential communications, identity and data.
 
PSP can operate on traditional distributed networks or on third party blockchain networks, of both the public and permissioned varieties. For instance, PSP is currently being integrated into the ProximaX blockchain protocol, which is a next generation decentralized platform led by blockchain pioneer Lon Wong. Because PSP includes security measures that permit clients to transmit over networks without placing trust in the network nodes with respect to confidential content or routing information, a decentralized public blockchain network can potentially become as secure as a private network. We believe the large potential scale of these public blockchain networks is a significant benefit in respect to content delivery throughput and cost efficiency. We also believe that blockchain networks also tend to be more resilient to cyberattacks than traditional networks that route data through a centralized third-party provider because of massive redundancy.
 
Status of PSP Development. We have separated our PSP development progress into three stages based on our internal development roadmap. The first stage consisted mainly of the initial design and architectural planning work related to PSP and is complete. The two remaining development stages are expected to be completed in the first and third quarter of 2019, respectively. The second development stage relates principally to the completion of PSP’s ability to provide instructions to the node ecosystem of an existing blockchain network, as well as ensuring that PSP can be readily integrated with private distributed networks as well as widely-adopted blockchain protocols other than the ProximaX blockchain protocol. The third development stage relates principally to the completion and launch of the full-feature PSP product, as well as the launch of client-side software development kits and application programming interfaces. Although we hope to complete the development of PSP within the timeframes specified in our development roadmap, PSP is a new form of technology and its development may be subject to unanticipated delays.
 
Backchannel is the Front-end Counterpart to PSP. Backchannel is our branded framework designed to be an easy-to-integrate end user facing set of applications and utilities accessing PSP’s capabilities that provide a best-of-breed secure video-enabled mobile messaging solution for enterprise and government end users. Backchannel provides cross-platform applications, SDK’s and middleware for multiple use cases and applications covering desktop, mobile, server and internet of things (IOT) applications. Accordingly, Backchannel may be used by clients as a branded application, a private labeled application bearing client branding or a set of SDKs integrated into and powering a third-party application.

Our Backchannel-branded mobile communication solution automatically accesses PSP’s distributed security model, which, as described above, uses a variation of onion routing so that network nodes are unable to trace the origin and destination of messages or determine the participating device IP addresses. On some mobile device handsets, Backchannel also will be able to access the mobile trusted execution environment for hardware-based encryption and subscriber identity module identity attestation frameworks to further augment the chain of trust. In addition, Backchannel has the capability of leveraging cryptographically generated identities that are not tied to one’s personal information, and is able to interoperate with blockchain technologies to provide decentralized messaging and one-to-one live video streaming with enhanced privacy control.
 
Technology Implementation Services
 
In addition to developing and licensing our suite of secure communications software, we also began providing professional services to customize and integrate our software solutions to meet client needs in March 2018. For instance, on March 21, 2018, we entered into a technology services agreement with ProximaX whereby we agreed to provide certain development and related services to ProximaX to facilitate the implementation of PSP into ProximaX’s proprietary blockchain protocol that is currently under development. We plan to continue to offer a full suite of strategy consulting, implementation and support services to our clients looking to harness the superior scalability and security of our software solutions.
Consumer Applications
 
We operate a leading network of consumer applications that create a unique social media enterprise where users can meet, see, chat, broadcast and message in real time in a secure environment with others in our network. The proprietary technology underlying our products allows us to operate thousands of simultaneous streams, including on mobile platforms, which support interactions on a one-on-one, one-to-many and many-to-many basis. Furthermore, our technology is supported by 80 technologists, four technology centers and a portfolio of 26 issued patents.
Live Video Chat. We have three existing products in the video chat space: Paltalk, Camfrog and Tinychat. The major revenue-generating live video chat products are Paltalk and Camfrog. Each product enables individuals to self-organize around topics and users with common affinities. Tinychat enables adaptations of our video technology for alternative uses and opportunities in the future.
 
Paltalk and Camfrog are our major video chat applications and are both leading providers of live video social networking applications available on Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android and other tablet devices. Together, these products power one of the world’s largest global collections of video based communities, with proprietary technology to host thousands of simultaneous live group conversations on topics such as politics, financial markets, music and dating. Our proprietary client server technology helps maintain high quality video and audio, even as many users simultaneously watch a particular broadcaster. Paltalk and Camfrog both have hundreds of millions of registered users and attract a demographically and geographically diverse user base, with users in over 180 different countries. Paltalk users are approximately one-third domestic and two-thirds international, and Camfrog users have an even larger international presence, with a particular concentration in Southeast Asia.
 
Telecommunications. We own and operate a small telecommunications services provider called Vumber that enables users to have multiple phone numbers in any area code through which calls can be forwarded to a user’s existing cell phone or land line telephone number. Vumber serves both the retail and small business community. Vumber not only allows individuals to communicate while protecting privacy, but also gives business professionals the ability to add a new business line with any chosen area code to their cell phones. Vumber provides an in-depth data analytics platform that can track, record and analyze calls to gain new insights into one’s business.
Product Payment Options. Our users have a variety of methods by which to purchase product subscriptions across all of our platforms. Users can pay by credit card, PayPal, Western Union, check, local e-wallet providers, or complete an in-app purchase through the Apple App Store or Google Play for Android users.

Apple retains 30% of the revenue that is generated from sales on our iPhone application through in-app purchases in the United States. Google also retains 30% of the revenue that is generated from sales on Android applications via Google wallet through in-app purchases in the United States.
 
All of our credit card transactions are processed through various payment providers. Video chat users in certain international territories also have an option to purchase through local resellers. Local resellers prepay in bulk for services and debit the prepaid balance as one-time subscriptions and virtual currency are sold to end users. Regardless of which payment method is utilized, users may access our products through any of the gateways we offer. 

Company Business Strategy
 
Grow PeerStream Business-to-Business Solutions in Secure Communications
 
On March 21, 2018, as a first step in launching a business-to-business enterprise and commercializing PSP, we entered into a technology services agreement with ProximaX whereby we agreed to provide licensed software and certain development services to ProximaX to facilitate the implementation of PSP into ProximaX’s proprietary blockchain protocol that is currently under development. As integration of PSP into the ProximaX platform is presently in testing, and we are nearing sufficient completion of the technology to ramp up our commercialization efforts, we plan to build on this platform as one means of expanding the market opportunity for our secure communications solutions.
 
The cybersecurity market is large and growing rapidly, and the segment that addresses secure communications is attracting more interest as high profile communication hacks and data breaches gain media publicity. We believe PSP and Backchannel present a differentiated solution to this market with additional layers of security that are not commonly offered. We intend to commence marketing and customer discovery for these products in the first and second quarter of 2019, with full commercialization in the latter half of the year. We believe client prospects to be large organizations with widely distributed lines of confidential communication, including foreign and domestic governments, mobile carriers, large corporations and communications service providers of various types. We expect to approach this market through direct sales and channel partnerships.
 
Although PSP is initially being designed to be integrated into the ProximaX blockchain protocol, we are presently modifying it to be integrated with other widely-adopted blockchain protocols or into traditional distributed system architectures. Although the adaptation of PSP to blockchain protocols and system architectures outside of the ProximaX protocol would require custom development, we have taken steps to minimize the amount of effort that such development would entail. In addition, we expect to make a version of PSP open source, these modifications would not need to be completed by PeerStream. At that time, any developer would be able to take the PSP code and undertake custom modifications to integrate it into other systems.
 
Enhance Existing Live Video Chat Applications
 
We plan to enhance our existing live video chat applications in 2019, which we anticipate will include several initiatives intended to improve usage and revenue potential. We plan to add incentives for loyal or valuable users to enhance retention and overall user activity in the products. We also intend to improve our product and marketing capabilities on mobile, to enhance monetization and our ability to acquire new users on mobile platforms. In addition, we expect to increase the quality and quantity of live streaming entertainment content and broaden the distribution across our user base. Finally, in 2019 we anticipate making significant progress in integrating certain technical functions of Paltalk and Camfrog, which will reduce operating costs and speed time-to-market of future enhancements.
Defend our Intellectual Property
 
We have a portfolio of 26 issued patents. We have successfully defended our intellectual property in the past and have generated tens of millions of dollars in licensing fees for the use of our patents. In 2016, we commenced an enforcement action related to two of our patents against Riot Games, Inc. and Valve Corporation for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,822,523 and 6,226,686 with respect to their online games League of Legends and Defense of the Ancients 2. These two patents were previously asserted against, and then licensed to, Microsoft, Sony, and Activision. For additional information concerning the status of these proceedings, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” herein.

Sale of Non-Core Assets
 
On January 31, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with The Dating Company, LLC, pursuant to which we sold substantially all of the assets related to our online dating services business under the domain names FirstMet, 50more, and The Grade for a cash purchase price of $1.6 million, with $100,000 of the purchase price to be held in an escrow account to secure certain of our post-closing indemnification obligations. The closing of the asset sale was effective as of January 31, 2019.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
We invest in advertising and marketing primarily for the purpose of acquiring users for our consumer applications. We adapt our marketing expenditures and channels as we gather the data to analyze the success of our campaigns. We primarily advertise through internet and mobile advertising networks and run hundreds of campaigns at any given time, targeting various audiences of users, and focusing on campaigns that we believe will produce a positive return over the lifetime of new users. We also generate new sign-ups organically, as people find our sites and applications through brand recognition and word of mouth, search engines and product review websites.
 
In addition, we expect to be expanding our marketing efforts in support of our secure communications solutions business line. We expect that this marketing effort will include trade show exhibition, event hosting or sponsorship, content marketing, digital and print media, and more. We anticipate that these marketing efforts will begin the process of establishing the PeerStream brand as a leader in the secure communications segment of cybersecurity.
 
Competition and Our Industry
 
Competition in the industries in which we compete remains fierce. The markets for secure communications software, technology implementation services and consumer applications are extremely dynamic and are undergoing constant change. We believe this environment creates significant opportunities for us as well as our direct and indirect competitors. Our principal competitors consist of:

· | Secure Communications Software Licensing: Adeya SA, Commdex, Ercom, IVCi LLC, KoolSpan, Ribbon Communications Inc. and Wickr;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Technology Implementation Services: IBM, Accenture, Cognizant, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, Wipro Limited, as well as Virtusa, Saksoft, Mindtree, Larsen & Toubro Infotech Limited, ConsenSys, Vanbex Group and CanYa.; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Consumer Applications: YouNow, Live.me, BIGO Live, Live.ly, Houseparty, Facebook Live, YouTube Live, Instagram Live, and Twitch.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, managerial, technological and other resources than we do. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into the industries in which we operate, and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and skilled personnel may become one of our competitors.
 
In order to compete effectively, we seek to offer software, services and applications that are differentiated from existing products, superior in quality and more appealing than those of our competitors. We believe that our software offerings, including PSP and Backchannel, will compete favorably against secured communications tools offered by our competitors due to their ability to scale easily, their cost-efficiency and their innovative technology. Within consumer applications, we believe that we have the tools and expertise to attract new users through Facebook and other sources at a lower cost per subscriber than certain of our traditional competitors.
 
Although we believe we have the capability to compete effectively in our industries, our competitors may offer products, services and applications that we do not provide with more desirable features or at lower prices, and they may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. In addition, many of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have, including relationships with our potential customers.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet, many of which are still evolving and being litigated in the courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations may involve user privacy, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal and state laws regarding privacy and protection of user data, which are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. We are also subject to diverse and evolving laws and regulations in other countries in which we operate. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate. Because our applications are accessible worldwide and used by residents of some foreign countries, foreign jurisdictions may claim that we must comply with foreign laws, even in jurisdictions in which we have no local business entity, employees or infrastructure.

We are also subject to federal laws and regulations regarding content, privacy and the protection of user data, including The Communications Decency Act of 1996, as amended (“The Communications Decency Act”), The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as amended, The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, as amended, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing (“CAN-SPAM”) Act of 2003, among others. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits our liability as an online service provider for linking to or hosting third-party content that infringes copyrights. The Communications Decency Act provides statutory protections to online service providers like us who distribute third-party content. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act restricts the ability of online service providers to collect personal information from children under 13. Congress, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and many states have promulgated laws and regulations regarding email advertising, including the CAN-SPAM Act. Any changes in these laws or judicial interpretations narrowing the protections of these laws may subject us to increased risk, increased costs of compliance, and limits on the operation of certain parts of our business.
 
Growing public concern about privacy and the use of personal information may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny. The FTC has, over the last few years, begun investigating companies that have used personally identifiable information in a deceptive or unfair manner or in violation of a posted privacy policy. On May 25, 2018, the European Union implemented a new privacy directive called the Global Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) that imposes additional new regulatory scrutiny on our business in that geographic region with possible financial consequences for noncompliance. If we are accused of violating the terms of our privacy policy or implementing unfair privacy practices, we may be forced to expend significant financial and managerial resources to defend against an FTC or GDPR enforcement action. Our user database holds the personal information of our users and subscribers residing in the United States and other countries, and we could be sued by those users if any of the information is misappropriated. Any failure by us to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data could also result in loss of user confidence in our consumer applications and services and ultimately in a loss of active subscribers, which could adversely affect our business.
 
In addition, virtually every U.S. state has passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data resulting in unauthorized disclosure, many of which are modeled on California’s Information Practices Act. There are a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress and various state legislative bodies concerning data protection that could, if adopted, have an adverse effect on our business. We are unable to determine if and when such legislation may be adopted. Many jurisdictions, including the European Union, have adopted breach notification and other data protection notification laws designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information. The introduction of new privacy and data breach laws and the interpretation of existing privacy and data breach laws in the United States, Europe and other foreign jurisdictions is constantly evolving. There is a risk that new laws may be introduced or existing laws may be applied in a way that would conflict our current data protection practices or prevent the transfer of data between countries in which we operate.
 
In addition, rising concern about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct may in the future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our applications or restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business. These regulatory and legislative developments, including excessive taxation, may prevent or significantly limit our ability to expand our business.
 
We may also become subject to laws or regulations in the future that limit our ability to accept bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment or to otherwise hold bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. As cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies, with certain governments deeming cryptocurrency offerings and cryptocurrency exchanges illegal, while others have allowed their use and trade. Governments may in the future curtail or outlaw the acquisition or use of cryptocurrencies or the exchange of cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies. Ownership of, holding, trading in or participating in offerings of cryptocurrencies may then be considered illegal and subject to sanction. Governments may also take regulatory action that may increase the cost and/or subject companies that transact in or hold cryptocurrencies to additional regulation.

Employees
 
As of March 14, 2019, we had 42 employees. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate and retain qualified personnel. We attract and retain employees by offering training, bonus opportunities, competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits package.
