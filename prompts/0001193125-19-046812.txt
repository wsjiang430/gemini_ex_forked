Who We Are 
 Gogo is the in-flight Internet company. Our mission is to provide ground-like connectivity to every device on every flight around the globe, enabling superior passenger experiences and efficient flight operations. To accomplish our mission, we design, build and operate dedicated satellite and air-to-ground (ATG) networks, engineer, install and maintain in-flight systems of proprietary hardware and software, and deliver customizable connectivity and wireless entertainment services and global support capabilities to our aviation partners. 
 We are the leading global provider of in-flight broadband connectivity and wireless entertainment services, with our equipment installed and services provided on approximately 3,100 commercial aircraft and approximately 5,200 business aircraft as of December 31, 2018. Our industry is characterized by rapid technological development, and we continually invest in research and development to maintain our leading global market share and support our aviation partners needs. Since we announced our next-generation 2Ku global satellite system (2Ku) in 2014, fourteen domestic and international airlines have selected 2Ku for installation, and as of December 31, 2018, our 2Ku system had been installed on more than 1,000 aircraft with approximately 1,000 additional 2Ku aircraft in backlog (as defined below under the heading Contracts with Airline Partners). Of the aircraft installed with 2Ku as of December 31, 2018, approximately 520 were upgrades from currently-installed Gogo systems. The 2Ku system is currently capable of delivering peak speeds of 100 Mbps to the aircraft. We also continue to innovate and improve our North American terrestrial networks. We have been working for several years on development and testing of an upgraded ATG network that employs 2.4 
 
2 


  GHz of unlicensed spectrum, and this network has achieved a ten-fold increase from the speed of our current ATG-4 system (ATG-4). We have not made a decision to proceed with implementation of the 2.4 GHz solution, and due to uncertainty regarding the possible effect of U.S. government security concerns on our development partners ability to continue to serve us, we are exploring other solutions for upgrading and increasing the capacity of the current ATG network. All of the solutions we are considering would enable us to leverage our existing ATG network as well as our data centers, core system software, network operating center and network staff. 
 Our leading global market share supports our continued investment in ongoing research and development and the global operating capabilities required to support our aviation partners needs. Our technology roadmap includes plans for continued rapid improvement in bandwidth speeds and other performance metrics of our in-flight systems.

 | Connected Aircraft Services. Using our Connected Aircraft Services (CAS), our aviation partners can access connectivity-based, data-oriented applications designed to improve the flying experience and enhance the operational efficiency of our airline partners by leveraging the connectivity we provide to the aircraft. CAS provides value by capturing key data from aircraft sensors, databases and crew inputs and combining it with data coming from the ground to provide comprehensive and real-time visibility into operations. For example, CAS currently supports route optimization, turbulence avoidance, electronic flight bag (EFB) applications, real-time credit card processing and weather data. In October 2018, we partnered with GOL to launch our Aircraft Data Service, Wireless Quick Access Recorder and Automated Turbulence Reporting, which analyzes and integrates aircraft and EFB data to provide GOL with real-time access to turbulence and other information. Similarly, in October 2018, our BA segment introduced Gogo DASH, a mobile application that gives airborne personnel real-time visibility into their Gogo systems during flight and provides them with key information to help diagnose and resolve an issue by working with their ground operations teams and Gogo customer support.

 Competitive Strengths 
 We maintain the leading global market position in connectivity for each of the CA and BA markets. We have designed our value proposition to align with our aviation partners priorities and we believe that our comprehensive product and service portfolio sets us apart from competitors by better meeting customer needs through: 

 | Leading Performance. Our networks and systems are designed to provide the best in-flight Internet experience and highest network and system availability across the broadest range of aircraft wherever they fly.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We offer the broadest array of in-flight connectivity technologies in the market, including our proprietary 2Ku, Ku, ATG-4/ATG, AVANCE L5 and AVANCE L3 systems. We are the only in-flight connectivity provider to offer both ATG and satellite-based solutions and our satellite network offers the most comprehensive global coverage in our industry. The breadth of our technologies allows our customers to select the best solution based on aircraft size and route  serving everything from smaller BA aircraft to the largest widebody CA aircraft. 
 With the addition of our next-generation modem and the addition of more HTSs to our network, 2Ku is capable of delivering peak speeds to the aircraft of 100 Mbps. 2Ku enables end users to enjoy a ground-like experience, including streaming and other bandwidth-intensive applications. It employs two low-profile satellite antennas with higher spectral efficiency, superior equatorial performance, and lower drag and fuel burn as compared to competing satellite antennas. 
 

 | Continuous Innovation. We design our solutions to provide leading performance and to last for many years, as evidenced by our 2Ku system. The 2Ku system is designed to access maximum satellite capacity, and its open, modular architecture enables us to obtain satellite capacity from multiple existing and anticipated satellites operated by multiple providers, thereby enabling our aviation partners to offer leading performance for many years without the need for antenna swaps or other invasive changes to the aircraft. This open architecture is facilitated by our proprietary antenna system and our investments in modem and antenna positioner hardware and software. The 2Ku architecture is designed to enable adoption of new technologies in the future while minimizing the impact of hardware changes on aircraft.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our strategy does not include owning or operating satellites. By leasing satellite capacity, we maximize our flexibility to adopt rapid innovations in satellites and to obtain capacity when, where and in the amount required by our aviation customers. We expect continued rapid innovation in satellites to yield improved global coverage and redundancy, increased capacity and peak speed, and lower latency. With approximately 80% of the commercial air traffic concentrated in less than 20% of the global airspace, our multi-provider, multi-satellite approach most efficiently matches supply with demand. 
 We continue to innovate and have a strong track record. We pioneered and have led innovation in our industry for more than 25 years, as evidenced by the nine network technologies, six of which are proprietary to Gogo, that we have deployed during this time. In addition, we hold more than 200 U.S. and international patents, most of which relate to network technology. In addition to exploring possible technologies that would enable us to upgrade our ATG network, we are currently researching and developing a fully electronic phased array antenna as well as activities that relate to the use of LEO satellite capacity. 
 

 | Customer-Focus. We provide a hardware and software platform that allows connectivity-enabled services to be deployed quickly, easily and flexibly across all of our networks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Gogo supports airline partners with customized portals and applications. These portals are managed by Gogo, airlines or third parties that rely on Gogos platform for many functions, including user accounts and passwords, payments, entertainment and other stored content. These capabilities are common regardless of which network the aircraft operates on, enabling our airline partners to bring their customized user experiences to their full fleets. We offer various levels of customization based on our airline partners needs, ranging from a look and feel consistent with the airlines branding to fully customized portals designed to provide unique passenger experiences based on the airlines specifications.

 We are continually engaged in enhancing our services in order to enhance the user experience. For example, we employ sophisticated network management techniques intended to improve the user experience by ensuring that sufficient bandwidth is available for various services such as messaging, browsing and streaming. In addition, our captive portal enables us to develop system improvements that improve the user experience by streamlining the sign-on process and making it easier for users to access our IFC service. 
 Our AVANCE system provides BA customers with a common software platform that operates across all Gogo networks and allows aviation partners to customize their passengers in-flight experiences by selecting from a variety of offerings that include various levels of connectivity; on-demand entertainment; information and applications; smart cabin customization; and real-time support and tools. The flexibility of the AVANCE system enables BA owners and operators to add or reduce system capabilities as their needs change. 
 Additionally, both our CA and BA platforms provide hosting, reporting, data labels, storage and other capabilities for an increasing array of CAS applications from a variety of third-party partners. 
 

 | Long-Term Support. There are unique requirements that separate aviation from terrestrial markets and we have the necessary scale and expertise to address this market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Gogo supports the largest fleet of connected aircraft and we have acquired significant technological and operational expertise and developed long-term and robust supplier relationships in both business and commercial aviation. In commercial aviation, we have the capability to install ATG equipment overnight and satellite solutions in less than two days, and to deploy software upgrades remotely. As of December 31, 2018, we were operating 28 installation lines and 16 installation locations around the globe. After installation, our support continues and in 2018, we provided maintenance services for customer aircraft that flew more than 4.8 million flights to or from six continents. Airlines are increasingly assuming responsibility for equipment maintenance and we are leveraging our experience to support them, including by training them in best practices. 
 Growth Strategy 
 The four key drivers fueling Gogos growth and financial performance are: increasing the number of Gogo-connected aircraft, increasing average revenue per aircraft, reducing investment per aircraft and improving margins. 
 Increase Number of Gogo-Connected Aircraft 
 Less than half of the global fleet of approximately 22,500 commercial aircraft and 30,700 business aircraft are currently broadband connected. We expect that nearly all of the worlds commercial aircraft and a rapidly increasing percentage of business aircraft will be broadband connected over the next decade. These new connections will increasingly occur on new aircraft through the OEM channel. 
 

 | Commercial Aviation. As of December 31, 2018, we provided our connectivity services on 3,140 commercial aircraft. Based on the strength of our comprehensive portfolio, we expect to continue to sign contracts with airlines to equip existing and new aircraft. During 2018, the following aircraft were delivered through the OEM channel with our 2Ku system: Airbus A350; Boeing 787-9 and Bombardier A220.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Business Aviation. As of December 31, 2018, the business aviation market was comprised of approximately 23,000 business aircraft in North America and approximately 7,700 business aircraft in the rest of the world, and we had approximately 5,200 business aircraft online with broadband connectivity, principally in North America. We increased our number of broadband business aircraft online by more than 500 in 2018. A significant number of BA aircraft are new aircraft on which our systems are installed and sold by OEMs, including Beechcraft, Bombardier, Cessna, Dassault Falcon, Embraer, Gulfstream, and Learjet. Since 2017, we have offered our customers AVANCE L5, an integrated and customizable in-flight system that employs our ATG-4 network in North America and is faster than our Gogo Biz solution. In 2018, we introduced

AVANCE L3, a more compact integrated, customizable in-flight system that uses our ATG network and is targeted at light jets and turbo props in North America and we announced a new global Ku-based satellite solution for larger, long range business jets, which is expected to be commercially available in 2020. By leveraging networks shared with CA, we now have in-flight systems that address nearly all segments of the business aviation market. Our ability to provide CAS and our flexibility in providing various pricing options further support our strategy of targeting various segments of the market.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increase Average Revenue per Aircraft 
 We expect to continue to grow net annualized average monthly service revenue per aircraft equivalent (ARPA) by increasing the take rates for passenger connectivity and the adoption of additional services, including entertainment and CAS. 
 Our strategies for growing net annualized ARPA include the following: 
 

 | Increase Passenger Adoption of Connectivity. We intend to leverage our existing technology and our technology roadmap to continue to enhance the passenger experience and the number and quality of available services. Our mission is to provide all passengers on every flight a ground-like experience, including video streaming. We expect to engage additional passengers and grow net annualized ARPA through a combination of multiple tiers of service and multiple payers. In BA, we continue to introduce a variety of broadband and voice services and related pricing plans, allowing aircraft operators and owners various options based on data usage, flight frequency and the number and size of aircraft serviced. In CA, the increased bandwidth of 2Ku supports tiered services such as messaging, browsing and streaming and enables a variety of experiences and price points for passengers. Airlines provide amenities to passengers using segmentation based on cabin seating, ticket prices and other factors, and we expect our service revenue from airlines to grow as they increasingly purchase bandwidth to provide complimentary service for some or all of their passengers. We also expect to continue to receive service revenue from third parties. For example, we are currently engaged by T-Mobile to make our in-flight services available to its subscribers, and we expect other terrestrial mobile carriers and other companies, such as credit card providers, to enter into similar arrangements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increase Adoption of Wireless Entertainment. Gogo Vision was available on nearly all Gogo-connected aircraft in CA and approximately 660 BA aircraft as of December 31, 2018. Through our Gogo Vision platform, airlines offer passengers a library of movies and TV shows for wireless streaming to personal devices. By December 31, 2018, all of our airline customers had transitioned from the Gogo Vision passenger-paid model to a free-to-passenger model under which the airlines pay Gogo on a monthly basis and/or per view basis. Due in part to this transition, Gogo Vision views doubled from 2016 to 2017 and increased by 25% in 2018 to more than 50 million views. We expect wireless entertainment views to continue to grow, driven by increased awareness of the service, availability of additional content, increased use of Gogo TV (which delivers live content streamed directly to wireless devices), and the launch of Gogo Vision Touch, our seatback tablet screen technology developed in collaboration with Delta Air Lines.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increase Adoption of CAS. We expect that the demand by airlines for connectivity-based applications that improve the passenger experience and operational efficiency will increase over the next several years. This trend will drive data usage on our network and demand for platform services from Gogo. We are interfacing our equipment with the data buses on aircraft and are developing the hardware and software platforms that facilitate the development and deployment of applications. CAS currently supports aircraft crew devices and enables pilots and crew to utilize the following services: location tracking, aircraft data analytics, route optimization, turbulence avoidance, EFB applications, real-time credit card processing and weather data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reduce Our Investment per Aircraft 
 In CA, we define investment per aircraft as the installed cost of airborne equipment less the proceeds received from an airline partner. Our investment per aircraft varies depending on the commercial terms of our 
 
8 


  contract with the airline, the technology deployed, and the type of aircraft equipment installed. We are leveraging our experience in reducing installation times to assist our airline partners and their installers in conducting installations as quickly and efficiently as possible. Our ability to leverage our growing portfolio of STCs will further reduce the cost and time required to install new fleets. We have a broad portfolio of STCs and service bulletins for aircraft types to be equipped with 2Ku, which allows us to reuse STCs to reduce the time and cost required to obtain certification and to accelerate installation schedules. As of December 31, 2018, we had STCs to support 90% of the installations we plan to complete in 2019. In addition, as 2Kus performance and consumer appeal have been demonstrated, the price paid by airline partners for our airborne equipment has increased compared to 2Kus launch pricing. As our investment per aircraft declines and net annualized ARPA increases, our return on invested capital increases and the payback period is shortened. 
 Improve Margins 
 We have made substantial investments in our network, in-flight systems, in-flight service platforms and aviation partner support in order to serve aircraft operators globally. As we increase the number of aircraft online, particularly in CA-ROW, we expect to achieve benefits of scale as we have in CA-NA. In addition, by executing our Integrated Business Plan (IBP), Gogo 2020, which was designed to improve our operational and financial performance by reducing our cost structure, improving quality, increasing revenue and streamlining business processes, we expect our margins to improve. We also anticipate continued decreases in satellite costs which, together with our bandwidth management capabilities, are expected to contribute to margin improvement. 
Contracts with Airline Partners 
 In CA, we enter into connectivity agreements with our airline partners under which the airlines commit to have our equipment installed on some or all of the aircraft they operate, and we commit to provide passenger connectivity and/or entertainment services, and, in some circumstances, CAS, on such aircraft. We currently have definitive agreements with 18 commercial airlines. We have the exclusive right to provide Internet connectivity services on Gogo-installed aircraft throughout the term of the agreement in contracts with airline partners from which we derived a substantial majority of our consolidated revenue in 2018. The majority of our contracts with our airline partners have 10-year terms, with staggered expiration dates occurring on a fleet-by-fleet basis based on installation dates or on a contract basis, depending on the contract. Under our current contracts, the first expiration will occur in 2019 and the last in 2029 or later, depending on the timing of future installations. 
 We offer airline partners a variety of business models and work with each airline to tailor the model to meet its needs. We began our CA business with the turnkey model, under which we provide the airline with the full range of our services, charge the passenger for passenger connectivity or Gogo Vision services at prices we determine and remit to the airline a specified percentage of passenger revenue. Under such model, for satellite-based connectivity services, the airline typically pays Gogo a monthly fee for network monitoring and management services. Under some of our agreements, airlines have adopted or have the option to adopt an airline-directed model, whereby the airline partner has flexibility to determine which of the many end-to-end services it wants Gogo to provide, which services it wants to provide itself and how it wishes to price the services provided to passengers. For example, an airline may elect to be the retailer for in-flight connectivity and entertainment services to its passengers, rather than using Gogo as the distributor, or to offer our services on a complimentary basis to some or all of its passengers. In such case, we negotiate the fees the airline pays us for the connectivity and entertainment services provided, the bandwidth consumed, and any other services provided by Gogo. 
 Depending on the contract, installation and maintenance services may be performed by us and/or the airline. When we provide such services, under some agreements, we include charges for installation and maintenance in our equipment pricing package; in other circumstances, the airline pays us directly for such services. Under certain contracts, we provide equipment credits or other incentives based on the number of aircraft installed with 
 
9 


  our equipment and the timing of such installations. Our contracts with airline partners set forth specified timelines for the installation or delivery of our airborne equipment, as well as service level commitments, and our failure to meet such timelines or service level commitments generally requires us to pay penalties or liquidated damages to the airlines and in certain circumstances may result in our airline partners being permitted to terminate all or a portion of the contract. 
 As of December 31, 2018, inflight entertainment (IFE), which includes Gogo Vision, Gogo TV or Gogo Vision Touch, was included in the scope of services under agreements with ten of our airline partners and we are discussing with other airline partners the possibility of providing IFE on their installed fleets. We also provide certain airline partners with CAS, such as real-time credit card processing for passenger food and beverage purchases, flight crew access to real-time weather information, EFB applications and voice services in the cockpit. 
 Revenue from service provided on aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines accounted for approximately 23% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 (equipment revenue from Delta Air Lines was immaterial due to the fact that equipment transactions under the turnkey model are not considered a sale for accounting purposes). We have three principal contracts with Delta Air Lines. The contract for ATG service on Delta Air Lines mainline and regional jet fleets expires on the 13-year anniversary of specified installation milestones, which will occur in 2022 and 2027, respectively. Our contracts with Delta Air Lines for Ku-band satellite service on its international fleet and for 2Ku service will expire in 2027. 
 Revenue from service and equipment provided on aircraft operated by American Airlines accounted for approximately 22% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 (such revenue included equipment revenue recognized in January 2018 when American Airlines transitioned from the turnkey model to the airline-directed model). On February 24, 2017, we replaced our multiple contracts with American Airlines (including the contract originally entered into with US Airways) with one unified agreement (the Unified Agreement) covering aircraft installed or to be installed with our ATG and ATG-4 technologies and to be installed with our 2Ku technology. The Unified Agreement has different expiration dates for different fleet types. Generally, the term for each fleet type, other than those on which 2Ku will be installed, expires on the 10-year anniversary of the date on which 90% of such fleet type has been installed with our ATG equipment, or when the fleet types are retired or deinstalled. The termination dates for such fleet types (excluding retirements) range from 2022 to 2025. The Unified Agreement will terminate with respect to the 2Ku fleet on October 1, 2019. 
 Each of our contracts with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines provides for early termination by the airline in specified circumstances and allows the airline to terminate the contract should the percentage of passengers using the Gogo service on the airlines flights not meet certain thresholds. We currently experience, and for the last five years have experienced, connectivity take rates in excess of those thresholds. In addition, under the Unified Agreement, American Airlines has the option to terminate Gogo service, and as expected, it exercised such option on approximately 550 mainline aircraft on which our ATG/ATG-4 service has been provided. Of such aircraft, 374 were deinstalled in 2018 (primarily in the second half of the year) with the balance expected to be deinstalled in the first half of 2019. Our contracts with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines also permit these airlines to terminate their contracts prior to expiration upon the occurrence of other certain contractually stipulated events, including our failure to meet service level requirements and the circumstance in which another company provides an alternate connectivity service that is a material improvement over our passenger connectivity service, such that failing to adopt such service would likely cause competitive harm to the airline, and we are unable to match the competitive offer in terms of price, technology and schedule. Our contracts with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines also permit the airline to terminate the agreement for convenience with respect to certain fleets on or after specified dates, subject to payment of a specified termination fee. 
 No other contract accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.

 As of December 31, 2018, and we had approximately 1,000 CA aircraft on which we expected to install our 2Ku system under existing contracts and awards not yet under contract, which we refer to as backlog. Our backlog includes current aircraft online that are being upgraded to 2Ku. Our backlog may be impacted by a number of factors including decisions by airlines to exercise their contractual rights to have aircraft installed or deinstalled with our equipment, as a result of changes in fleet plans or otherwise. As backlog is based on various estimates and assumptions of management, we can provide no assurance that our backlog is indicative of future aircraft online. 
 Competition 
 Commercial Aviation 
 Our key competitors include Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., Inmarsat, SITAONAIR, Panasonic Avionics Corp., Collins Aerospace, Thales, ViaSat and Zodiac Inflight Innovations, all of which provide different technologies and strategies to provide in-flight connectivity and/or entertainment. We are the only telecommunications company focused exclusively on in-flight connectivity and in-flight entertainment and their unique requirements. We believe that our competitive advantages include the breadth of our technological solutions, our global coverage, our operational excellence, the variety of business models we offer to airlines and, increasingly, our ability to offer equipment through the OEM channel. The strategic priorities, offerings and capabilities of our competitors vary, including the variety of technologies available for various aircraft types, the ability to offer in-flight Internet solutions and video entertainment offerings, the ability to cost-effectively provide offerings on a global basis, the ability to manage capacity constraints, and the ability to offer, incorporate and manage new in-flight connectivity technologies and solutions as they become available. 
 Business Aviation 
 We compete against both equipment and telecommunications service providers to the business aviation market, including Honeywell Aerospace, Collins Aerospace, Satcom Direct and ViaSat. Also, Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., Panasonic Avionics Corp. and SmartSky Networks have announced that they intend to enter the business aviation market. 
Licenses and Regulation 
 Federal Aviation Administration 
 The FAA prescribes standards and certification requirements for the manufacturing of aircraft and aircraft components, and certifies repair stations to perform aircraft maintenance, preventive maintenance and alterations, including the installation and maintenance of aircraft components. Each type of aircraft operated in the United States under an FAA-issued standard airworthiness certificate must possess an FAA Type Certificate, which constitutes approval of the design of the aircraft type based on applicable airworthiness standards. When a party other than the holder of the Type Certificate develops a major modification to an aircraft already type-certificated, that party must obtain an FAA-issued STC approving the design of the modified aircraft type. We regularly obtain STCs for each aircraft type operated by each airline partner on whose aircraft our equipment will be installed and separate STCs typically are required for different configurations of the same aircraft type, such as when they are configured differently for different airlines. 
 After obtaining an STC, a manufacturer desiring to manufacture components to be used in the modification covered by the STC must apply to the FAA for a Parts Manufacturer Approval, or PMA, which permits the holder to manufacture and sell components manufactured in conformity with the PMA and its approved design and data package. In general, each initial PMA is an approval of a manufacturing or modification facilitys production quality control system. PMA supplements are obtained to authorize the manufacture of a particular part in accordance with the requirements of the pertinent PMA, including its production quality control system. We routinely apply for and receive such PMAs and supplements. 
 
11 


 Certain of our FCC licenses are conditioned upon our ability to obtain from the FAA a No Hazard Determination for our cell sites, which indicates that a proposed structure will not, if built as specified, create a hazard to air navigation. When building or altering certain cell sites, we may first be required to obtain such a determination. 
 Our business depends on our continuing access to, or use of, these FAA certifications, authorizations and other approvals, and our employment of, or access to, FAA-certified engineering and other professionals. 
 In accordance with these certifications, authorizations and other approvals, the FAA requires that we maintain, review and document our quality assurance processes. The FAA may visit our facilities at any time as part of our agreement for certification as a manufacturing facility and repair station to ensure that our facilities, procedures, and quality control systems continue to meet FAA requirements. In addition, we are responsible for informing the FAA of significant changes to our organization and operations, product failures or defects, and any changes to our operational facilities or FAA-approved quality control systems. Other FAA requirements include training procedures and drug and alcohol screening for safety-sensitive employees working at our facilities or on aircraft. 
 Foreign Aviation Regulation 
 According to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the airworthiness of U.S.-registered and FAA type-certificated aircraft on which FAA-certified Gogo equipment is installed is recognized by civil aviation authorities (CAAs) worldwide that are signatories to that Convention. As a result, Gogo does not expect to require further airworthiness certification formalities in countries outside of the United States for U.S.-registered aircraft that already have an STC issued by the FAA covering Gogo equipment. For aircraft registered with a CAA other than the United States, the installation of Gogo equipment requires airworthiness certification from an airworthiness certification body. Typically, the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered is responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of any aircraft modifications under its authority. 
 The FAA holds bilateral agreements with a number of certification authorities around the globe. Bilateral agreements facilitate the reciprocal airworthiness certification of civil aeronautical products that are imported/exported between two signatory countries. A Bilateral Airworthiness Agreement (BAA) or Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (BASA) with Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness provides for airworthiness technical cooperation between the FAA and its counterpart CAA. Under a BAA or BASA, the CAA of the aircrafts country of registration generally validates STCs issued by the FAA and then issues a Validation Supplemental Type Certificate. For countries with which the FAA does not have a BAA or BASA, Gogo must apply for certification approval with the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered. In order to obtain the necessary certification, Gogo will be required to comply with the airworthiness regulations of the country in which the aircraft is registered. Failure to address all foreign airworthiness and aviation regulatory requirements at the commencement of each airline partners service in any country in which it registers aircraft when there are no applicable bilateral agreements may lead to significant additional costs related to certification and could impact the timing of our ability to provide our service on our airline partners fleets. 
 U.S. Department of Transportation 
 The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) established an Advisory Committee on Accessible Air Transport to negotiate and develop a proposed rule concerning accommodations for passengers with disabilities in three basic areas, including IFE and closed captioning of IFE. The Committee issued a resolution in late 2016 which included its recommendations to the DOT for a rule on IFE. Since a final rule on IFE has not been issued, however, it is unclear how, if at all, it may impact Gogo. 
 Federal Communications Commission 
 Under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), the FCC licenses the spectrum that we use and regulates the construction, operation, acquisition and sale of our wireless operations. 
 
12 


  The Communications Act and FCC rules also require the FCCs prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an FCC license, or the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of the equity or voting control of Gogo by non-U.S. individuals or entities. 
 Our various services are regulated differently by the FCC. For example, our BA business provides some of its voice and data services (not including Gogo Biz or AVANCE) by reselling the telecommunications services of two satellite operators. Because we provide these services on a common carrier basis, we are subject to the provisions of Title II of the Communications Act, which require, among other things, that the charges and practices of common carriers be just, reasonable and non-discriminatory. In addition, our BA segment provides an interconnected voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) service. The FCC applies many, but not all, of the same regulatory requirements to interconnected VoIP service as it does to common carrier telecommunications services. 
 We offer connectivity service in the United States to commercial and business aviation aircraft through our own facilities, using our ATG License, a nationwide commercial air-ground radiotelephone license that operates in the 800 MHz band. We obtained and paid for this spectrum through an auction conducted by the FCC. See ATG License Terms and Conditions. 
 In June 12, 2015, our mobile wireless broadband Internet access services became classified as Title II telecommunications services, subject to FCC common carrier regulation and broad net neutrality rules pursuant to an FCC order released March 12, 2015 (the Open Internet Order). The Open Internet Order prohibited broadband providers from blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind; or prioritizing the content and services of their affiliates. Other than for paid prioritization, the rules contained an exception for reasonable network management. 
 However, on January 4, 2018, the FCC released an order (the Restoring Internet Freedom Order) that repealed most of the Open Internet Order, reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a lightly regulated, non-common carrier information service, and removed virtually all of the compliance obligations that the Open Internet Order imposes on our mobile wireless broadband Internet access services. The Restoring Internet Freedom Order went into effect on June 11, 2018. Under the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, Gogo may remain subject to certain modified transparency obligations that require disclosure of network management practices, performance, and commercial terms. 
 Our Internet access service is also subject to the FCCs data roaming rules, which require commercial mobile data service (CMDS) providers like Gogo to negotiate roaming arrangements with any requesting facilities-based, technologically compatible providers of CMDS. The rules do not give other providers the right to install equipment on Gogo-equipped aircraft, and do not require the Gogo service to be provided on a discounted basis, although the arrangement must be commercially reasonable. The rules allow us to take reasonable measures to safeguard the quality of our service against network congestion that may result from roaming traffic. Neither the Open Internet Order nor the Restoring Internet Freedom Order altered Gogos obligations with respect to data roaming, but the FCC has committed to revisiting data roaming rules in the future. 
 In addition, most of our services are subject to various rules that seek to ensure that the services are accessible to persons with disabilities, including requirements related to the pass-through of closed captioning for certain IP-delivered video content offered through our Gogo Vision service. 
 In addition to the two ATG licenses, we hold other FCC licenses, including microwave licenses that are used for backhaul in our terrestrial network, one fixed satellite earth station license used for network testing and 
 
13 


  support, one experimental license used for testing equipment, two aircraft radio licenses, and an authorization for the provision of voice and data services between the United States and foreign points. We also hold a license for blanket authority to operate Ku-band satellite transceivers on up to 2,000 aircraft, which allows us to provide domestic and international broadband service (although some countries require additional authorizations of their own). 
 ATG License Terms and Conditions 
 The FCC issued our ATG License on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term. We have satisfied our obligation under the license to provide substantial service to aircraft, and on January 25, 2017, we received confirmation from the FCC that the license has been renewed until October 31, 2026. 
 Our 1 MHz ATG license obtained in 2013 from LiveTV was also originally issued on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term, although there is no substantial service obligation that attaches to this license. Our application to renew our license was subsequently granted for an additional 10-year term. On August 3, 2017, the FCC released an order which, among other things, revised the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is not currently clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. 
 Our two ATG licenses contain certain conditions that require us to comply with all applicable FCC and FAA rules as well as all bilateral agreements between the United States and Canada and the United States and Mexico regarding the frequencies that are allocated for ATG services. These agreements apply to our use of the spectrum in areas adjacent to the United States northern and southern borders and in and out of Canadian and Mexican airspace. 
 A bilateral ATG spectrum coordination agreement between the U.S. and Canada has been negotiated and approved and a bilateral agreement between the United States and Mexico is still pending. In 2012, Industry Canada issued to our Canadian subsidiary a subordinate license that allows us to use Canadian ATG spectrum of which SkySurf Communications Inc. is the primary licensee. In 2012, we entered into the License Agreement with SkySurf, which has an initial term of ten years commencing on August 14, 2012, and, provided that the primary spectrum license agreement issued by Industry Canada (now Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada or ISED) to SkySurf remains in effect at such dates, is renewable at our option for an additional 10-year term following the initial expiration and thereafter for a further five-year term. The term of the License Agreement, including the initial 10-year term and any renewals, is contingent on the effectiveness and renewal of the primary spectrum license, issued by Industry Canada to SkySurf on June 30, 2009, which was to expire on June 29, 2019. Following a consultation regarding renewal of the ATG license, ISED renewed SkySurfs ATG license for an eight-year term commencing June 29, 2019. 
 Any future coordination agreement with Mexico and/or a Mexican ATG licensee could affect our ability to provide our broadband Internet service in the border areas using our current cell sites at current operating power levels and could affect our ability to establish or maintain ATG service in the border areas as aircraft fly into and out of Mexican airspace. Once a provider of ATG services is licensed in Mexico, we hope to negotiate an arrangement that will provide seamless connectivity on flights between Mexico and the United States. 
 Equipment Certification 
 We may not lease, sell, market or distribute any radio transmission equipment used in the provision of CA or BA services unless such equipment is certified by the FCC as compliant with the FCCs technical rules. All certifications required for equipment currently used in the provision of our services have been obtained.

 Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations 
 Notwithstanding the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, which reclassified broadband Internet access as a Title I information service, we must continue to comply with certain Communications Act and FCC privacy and data security rules for our services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information. 
 We are also subject to other federal and state consumer privacy and data security requirements. For example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Although the FTCs authority to regulate the non-common carrier services offered by communications common carriers has not been clearly delineated, FTC officials have publicly stated that they view the FTC as having jurisdiction over Internet service providers non-common carrier services, and we believe that the FTC has jurisdiction over all of our services. The FTC has brought enforcement actions under the FTC Act against companies that among other things: (1) collect, use, share, or retain personal information in a way that is inconsistent with the representations, commitments, and promises that they make in their privacy policies and other public statements; (2) have privacy policies that do not adequately inform consumers about the companys actual practices; and (3) fail to reasonably protect the security, privacy and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information. 
 We collect personally identifiable information, such as name, address, e-mail address and credit card information, directly from our users when they register to use our service. We also may obtain information about our users from third parties. We use the information that we collect to, for example, consummate their purchase transaction, customize and personalize advertising and content for our users and enhance the entertainment options when using our service. Our collection and use of such information is intended to comply with our privacy policy, which is posted on our website, applicable law and our contractual obligations to airlines, BA customers and other third parties, as well as industry standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We are also subject to state mini-FTC Acts, which also prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices, along with data security breach notification laws requiring entities holding certain personal data to provide notices in the event of a breach of the security of that data. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches. A few states have also imposed specific data security obligations. These state mini-FTC Acts, data security breach notification laws, and data security obligations may not extend to all of our services and their applicability may be limited by various factors, such as whether an affected party is a resident of a particular state. 
 Certain states have also enacted specific privacy laws to which we may be subject. For example, on September 23, 2018, the governor of California signed into law an amended version of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA). The CCPA provides broad new privacy rights for California consumers, including, among others, the right to obtain copies of their personal information collected in the past 12 months, the ability to opt out from the sale of personal information, and the right to demand deletion of personal information. The CCPA will also impose compliance requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from consumers, including, among others, notice, consent, and data retention requirements. It will take effect on January 1, 2020. 
 While we believe that we have implemented reasonable administrative, physical and electronic security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personally identifiable information, cyber-attacks on companies have increased in frequency and potential impact in recent years and may be successful despite reasonable precautions and result in substantial potential liabilities. 
 As we expand our operations to include a physical international presence, or otherwise expand our collection of personally identifiable information of residents in other countries, we may be subject to the data protection regulations of the relevant countries. On May 25, 2018, the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect, which has imposed more restrictive privacy-related requirements for entities outside the European Union that process personally identifiable information about European data subjects. In 
 
15 


  addition, certain countries have laws which restrict the transfer of personally identifiable information outside of such countries. For example, both Switzerland and the member states of the European Union impose restrictions on transferring such data to countries, including the United States, that they do not deem to offer a similar standard of protection as they require. Certain mechanisms apply under Swiss and European Union member state laws that permit the cross-border transfer of personal information to countries that are not deemed adequate, such as the United States. Gogo has entered into standard contractual clauses approved by the European Union and Switzerland to legitimize these transfers. There is a risk that these standard contractual clauses may be invalidated by the Court of Justice for the European Union as a lawful data transfer mechanism on the grounds that they do not provide adequate protection of European data subjects personally identifiable information. There is also a risk that EU data protection authorities may investigate or bring enforcement actions with criminal and administrative sanctions. Such actions could also damage our business and harm our reputation. 
 Truth in Billing and Consumer Protection 
 The FCCs Truth in Billing rules require full and fair disclosure of all charges on customer bills for telecommunications services, except for broadband Internet access services. Thus, these rules apply to our satellite-based BA services. This disclosure must include brief, clear and non-misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided. States also have the right to regulate wireless carriers billing; however, we are not currently aware of any states that impose billing requirements on ATG services. 
CALEA 
 The FCC has determined that facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, which include Gogo, are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which requires covered service providers to build certain law enforcement surveillance assistance capabilities into their communications networks and to maintain CALEA-related system security policies and procedures. We have implemented such policies and procedures and based upon our periodic self-assessments we believe that our network is compliant with CALEA. 
Foreign Government Approvals 
 In connection with our satellite service, we have implemented a process for obtaining any required authority needed to provide our service over the airspace of foreign countries or verifying that no additional authorization is needed. Each country over which a Gogo-equipped aircraft flies has the right to limit, regulate (e.g., through a licensing regime) or prohibit the offering of our service. We may not be able to obtain the necessary authority for every country over which a partner airline flies. For some countries, we have not been and do not expect to be able to obtain a definitive answer regarding their potential regulation of our service, and we may incur some regulatory risk by operating over the airspace of these countries. Failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements could result in penalties being imposed on Gogo and/or on its airline partners, allow airline partners affected by such requirements to terminate their contracts with us prior to expiration or, under a contract with one of our airline partners, require us to pay liquidated damages. Regulation by U.S. and foreign government agencies, including the FCC, which issued our exclusive ATG spectrum license, and the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services. Moreover, even countries that have previously provided clearance for our service have the right to change their regulations at any time. 
Seasonality 
 The demand for air travel, including business travel, is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect our overall passenger opportunity to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year due to an increase in leisure travel offset in part by a decrease in business travel during the summer months and holidays. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
16 


 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual restrictions to protect intellectual property and proprietary technology owned or used by us. 
 We have patented certain of our technologies in the United States and certain countries outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we held U.S. patents expiring on dates ranging from February 2019 to December 2037, and foreign patents expiring on dates ranging from August 2020 to June 2035. We do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent on any single patent or group of patents that we own. We also have a number of patent applications pending both in and outside of the United States and we will continue to seek patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to the extent we believe such protection is appropriate and cost-effective. 
 We consider our brands to be important to the success of our business and our competitive position. We rely on both trademark registrations and common law protection for trademarks. Our registered trademarks in the United States and certain other countries include, among others, Gogo, Gogo Biz and Gogo Vision, although we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we currently do business or intend to do business in the future. Generally, the protection afforded for trademarks is perpetual, if they are renewed on a timely basis, if registered, and continue to be used properly as trademarks. 
 We license or purchase from third parties technology, software and hardware that are critical to providing our products and services. Much of this technology, software and hardware is customized for our use and would be difficult or time-consuming to obtain from alternative vendors. We also license our proprietary technology and software to third parties to enable them to integrate such technology and software into the products they provide to us. Many of our agreements with such third parties are renewable for indefinite periods of time unless either party chooses to terminate, although some of our agreements expire after fixed periods and require renegotiation prior to expiration in order to extend the term. Among the most material of our technology-related agreements are those for modems, base stations and antennas. Our agreements for modems, base stations and antennas do not renew automatically and thus require periodic renegotiation. Such agreements as well as certain licenses to commercially available software are material to our business. 
 We have developed certain ideas, processes, and methods that contribute to our success and competitive position that we consider to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, vendors, and airline partners. Trade secrets can be protected for an indefinite period so long as their secrecy is maintained. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,153 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
