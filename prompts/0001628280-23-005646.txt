Business Combination Overview
On October 20, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Mirion Technologies, Inc. (formerly known as GS Acquisition Holdings Corp II) consummated its previously announced Business Combination pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement. In connection with the Business Combination, stockholders of GSAH elected to redeem 14,628,610 shares of GSAH's Class A common stock, representing approximately 19.5% of GSAH's issued and outstanding Class A common stock before giving effect to the Business Combination. As of the closing of the Business Combination, the former Sponsor owned 18,750,000 shares of Class B common stock ("Founder Shares") which automatically converted into 18,750,000 shares of Class A common stock at the closing of the Business Combination.
In order to implement a structure similar to that of an “Up-C,” the Company formed IntermediateCo, and a newly-formed subsidiary of IntermediateCo merged with and into Mirion TopCo with Mirion TopCo surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of IntermediateCo. The Company holds 100% of the shares of IntermediateCo Class A common stock, and greater than 80% of the shares of IntermediateCo Class B common stock. The shares of IntermediateCo Class B common stock not held by the Company are held by certain pre-Business Combination stockholders of Mirion TopCo, as described below.
The aggregate business combination consideration (the “Business Combination Consideration”) paid by the Company to the pre-Business Combination stockholders of Mirion TopCo (collectively, the "Mirion Sellers") in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination was approximately $1.3 billion in cash, 30,401,902 newly issued shares of Class A common stock and 8,560,540 newly issued shares of the Class B common stock. The Mirion Sellers receiving shares of Class B common stock also received one share of IntermediateCo Class B common stock per share of Class B common stock as a paired interest (the “paired interests”). Each share of Class A common stock and each paired interest were valued at $10.00 per share for purposes of determining the aggregate number of shares issued to the Mirion Sellers.
The holders of the founder shares agreed to waive the anti-dilution adjustments provided for in GSAH’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which were applicable to the Class B common stock. As a result of such waiver, the 18,750,000 founder shares automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis upon the consummation of the Business Combination. Pursuant to the Sponsor Agreement, the founder shares also became subject to vesting in three equal tranches, based on the volume-weighted average price of the Class A common stock being greater than or equal to $12.00, $14.00, and $16.00 (each, a “Founder Share Vesting Event”) per share for any 20 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading day period. Vesting of the founder shares will be accelerated upon certain sale events based on the per share price of the Class A common stock in such sale event. Holders of the founder shares are entitled to vote such founder shares and receive dividends and other distributions with respect to such founder shares prior to vesting, but such dividends and other distributions with respect to unvested founder shares will be set aside and shall only be paid to the holders of the founder shares upon the vesting of such founder shares. The founder shares will be forfeited to us for no consideration if they fail to vest within five years of the Closing Date.
Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, GSAH entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors (collectively, the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, the PIPE Investors collectively subscribed for 90,000,000 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to $900,000,000 (the “PIPE Investment” and, such shares, the “PIPE Shares”). The PIPE Investment was consummated substantially concurrently with the Closing.
A subsidiary of Mirion TopCo, Mirion Technologies (HoldingSub1), Ltd. (“UKTopCo”), previously issued certain PIK Notes to certain Mirion TopCo stockholders and members of Mirion management (collectively, the “PIK Notes”). Substantially concurrent with the Closing, a portion of the Business Combination Consideration was used to extinguish the PIK Notes in full.
On October 20, 2021, the Board of Directors determined to change Mirion TopCo's fiscal year end from June 30 of each year to December 31 of each year in order to align Mirion’s fiscal year end with GSAH’s fiscal year end.
Industry Overview
We have two reportable business segments: Medical and Industrial. Our Medical segment is based around our sales, products, and services to customers in the medical market. The Industrial segment is primarily based around the nuclear energy, defense, laboratories, and scientific research markets as well as other industrial markets.
Medical
Our medical market is comprised of rapidly growing product applications in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and occupational dosimetry services. We offer both hardware and software solutions, as well as value added services within diagnostic imaging, radiotherapy, and nuclear medicine that enhance the effectiveness and safety of life-saving procedures. According to the World Nuclear Association, or WNA, as of April 2022, there are over 10,000 hospitals worldwide using radioisotopes in medicine, with about 90% of the procedures for diagnostics, and more than 40 million procedures are performed globally every year, 20 million being in the United States and 10 million in Europe. The WNA also estimates that as of April 2022, the use of radioactive substances, or radiopharmaceuticals, in diagnosis is growing at over 10% per year. In the radiotherapy market, demand is driven by replacement of the underlying linear accelerator, or Linac, installed base. As of 2019 there were approximately 14,000 Linacs deployed worldwide, and it is estimated that this will grow to approximately 16,500 Linacs worldwide by 2024, according to a global consulting firm.
Nuclear medicine is a medical specialty that uses radiopharmaceuticals to diagnose, monitor, and treat disease. Our products address the complicated lifecycle of radiopharmaceuticals from radiopharmaceutical production and handling through patient dosing, imaging, diagnosis, therapy, and patient administration with our line of dose calibrators, thyroid uptake systems, shielding systems, management software, and supporting accessories.
Radiotherapy, (also known as radiation therapy or radiation oncology), uses radiation in the form of X-rays, protons, and electrons to destroy cancer cells and shrink tumors. Our solutions and services address the challenge that every cancer center worldwide faces in making sure that the physician prescriptions and intended doses are accurately, consistently, and safely delivered to patients. Our suite of patient, machine, and diagnostic Quality Assurance ("QA") solutions are relied on in the field to mitigate errors, reduce inefficiencies, validate technologies and techniques, and, most importantly, improve the quality of clinical care.
Medical imaging encompasses multiple technologies (MRI, Ultrasound, X-ray) that are used to view the human body to diagnose, monitor, or treat medical conditions. We provide support for these imaging techniques through our array of C-Arm and ultrasound tables, MRI accessories, positioners, and radiation protection accessories.
As a result of the proliferation of radiological medical technologies, hospitals, clinics, and small dental and veterinary facilities rely on occupational dosimetry systems and services to ensure the safety of both medical personnel and patients. Our dosimetry services product, Instadose, provides instant dose measurement results when connected to any computer or mobile device via Bluetooth and ensures that radiation safety programs run smoothly and are easy to administrate.
Laboratories and Research
The laboratory and research market includes different types of facilities like environmental radiochemistry laboratories, research laboratories, research reactors and education laboratories. All these facilities analyze nuclear samples or monitor experiments to identify the chemical composition of the material involved or understand the basic structure of matter.
The environmental radiochemistry laboratories, or counting labs, monitor the environment by analyzing samples, measuring their radiation and identifying the source and the nature of contamination, if any. The laboratories can be governmental (e.g., health or environment institutions, safety authorities) or private (e.g., facility bio assay, process labs). We believe there are over 500 environmental laboratories worldwide based on our estimates as of December 2022.
Research centers include national laboratories and research institutions conducting research in the areas of space, underground studies, physics around synchrotrons and accelerators. Radiation measurement systems are used in research for the discovery of elements, to study the formation of matter after the big bang or in the deepest underground laboratories in the world to perform dark matter experiments. They are also used in space, mounted in satellites or robots, landing on planets (Mars Rover) or orbiting around Earth (STEREO), Saturn (Cassini), Venus and Mercury (Messenger), Pluto (New Horizons), Mars (MSL-Rad), Jupiter (JUNO) and Earth's moon (Artemis).
Research reactors are used for research and training, materials testing, medicine (like the production of radioisotopes) and industrial functions. According to the most recent publication as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K from the WNA, there were 223 operational nuclear research reactors in 53 countries, with 11 more under construction and 16 planned to be built, as of June 2021.
Education laboratories are located in universities and offer programs in nuclear engineering, health physics, radioprotection, nuclear physics or nuclear science and technology. We believe there are more than 600 colleges worldwide, universities and degree-granting institutions that are equipped with nuclear measurement products.
Nuclear
The nuclear end market spans the entire nuclear fuel cycle, including mining, enrichment, fuel manufacturing, nuclear power generation, waste management and fuel reprocessing. Key nuclear installations include mines, fuel fabrication facilities, commercial nuclear power reactors, reprocessing facilities, research facilities, and waste storage facilities.
We sell products and services for use in each of these types of installations at any stage of their life (construction, operation, decommissioning and dismantling), with commercial nuclear power reactors representing the majority of our sales into the nuclear end market. This market is segmented between new builds, installed base requesting upgrades/uprates/relicensing, and decommissioning and dismantling.
Driven by increasing demand for electricity and reliable and carbon-free energy, the nuclear power market is forecasted to grow in the near and long term, which presents opportunities for us. These trends are further driven by global decarbonization goals as well as energy security, which are likely to increase the demand for nuclear power.
The new build market is expected to be very dynamic. According to the WNA, in January 2023, there were 58 reactors in construction and 445 planned or proposed. The installed base market presents opportunities while nuclear power plants, or NPPs, are being relicensed with extended life time and upgraded. Meanwhile, we believe that more than 50 reactors will be shut down by 2030, growing the demand for radiation equipment used in decommissioning and dismantling of nuclear facilities.
Small modular reactors (SMRs) are defined as nuclear reactors having a power output of less than 300 MWe and are an emerging market opportunity for the Company. The global small modular reactor market comprised approximately $3.5 billion in revenue in 2020, and is projected to reach $18.8 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 15.8%. A major advantage of SMRs are its small size and shorter construction times compared to traditional bulk nuclear reactors. As SMRs are fully built in a factory using module fabrication, a high production rate can be achieved.
Defense
Our global defense end market is driven by a combination of military, civil defense and event-driven security spending. The proliferation of global security threats has reached an unprecedented level, driven by an unstable geopolitical climate, the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the emergence and expansion of terrorist organizations, the development of nuclear weapons in non-nuclear countries and the proliferation of radiological and nuclear technologies. Taken together, these threats have the potential to cause significant human casualties and economic loss. As a result, militaries, civil defense and other security organizations have bolstered investment in the prevention and detection of radiological threats as well as in technologies capable of detecting and monitoring radiation levels in the aftermath of radiological attack.
Militaries throughout the world utilize radiation detection technologies for troop security. Spending on personnel protection and detection of radiological threats is a priority for both NATO and non-NATO militaries and, as such, has led many countries to provide dosimeters to military personnel on a standard-issue basis. We believe that spending on these technologies will remain a high priority among armed forces globally.
Spending within the global civil defense, or homeland security, market has rapidly expanded in recent years based on increased threats presented by terrorist organizations. As a result, civil defense, first responder and other security organizations are investing in technologies and services designed both to protect civil defense personnel, civilians and domestic infrastructure from radiological threats and to detect and monitor radiation levels following a radiological incident, such as the release of a nuclear or other radiological device.
In addition, homeland security organizations are increasingly focused on enhancing radiological detection capabilities at critical points of entry, such as airports, ports and borders. Large-scale public meeting events have also greatly increased security measures at facilities, including rapid adoption of radiological detection technologies to address the increased threat of radiological attacks, due to their profile as high visibility targets.
Industrial
Other end markets include industrial facilities such as cement kilns, pulp and paper mills and coal/gas fired power boilers that utilize high-temperature industrial processes. These high-temperature processes are critical to plant operation and must be accurately monitored to ensure optimal operating conditions. Imaging equipment capable of withstanding the high temperatures and environmental conditions found in these facilities is employed to monitor and optimize process efficiency. These imaging systems require routine replacement or upgrades.
Other end markets also include original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs for general industrial market or medical applications, using radiation measurement detectors to sort material or precisely locate some radioisotopes.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe that significant opportunities for growth exist within each of our primary end markets.
Medical
Radiological procedure growth. The use of radiodiagnostic and radiotherapeutic procedures is expanding globally due to aging population demographics, technological advancements and emerging middle classes in developing economies. As the 
use of radiological procedures increases in the medical industry, so does our associated market opportunity. According to a global consulting firm, we believe the global nuclear medicine market is expected to grow approximately 7% per year from 2020 through 2030, primarily driven by the increase in the prevalence and incidences of cancer worldwide. Likewise, the global radiotherapy market is expected to grow approximately 6% per year from 2020 through 2030, primarily driven by factors including growing awareness about the benefits of radiotherapy for cancer control and eradication, increasing incidence and prevalence of cancer, and technological advancements in the field of radiotherapy. We play in select sub-segments of the global nuclear medicine and radiotherapy markets. The growth trajectories in these markets represent significant market opportunities for our products that are deployed in hospitals, clinics, and other diagnostic and therapeutic centers around the world.
Dosimetry outsourcing. In some regions outside the United States, dosimetry services for health care practitioners historically have been provided by government agencies. We believe that more government agencies are outsourcing dosimetry services to private providers due to favorable cost dynamics in some regions. This provides a market opportunity where we can leverage our technical expertise and North American service experience to expand into other regions as we have done through our acquisitions of state-owned dosimetry services businesses in the Netherlands and Germany. According to a global leading consulting firm, we believe our core dosimetry market is expected to grow 3 to 4% per year from 2020 through 2026, primarily driven by volume increase in number of healthcare workers exposed to radiation and standard annual price increases. In addition, through the differentiating factors behind the innovative Instadose product line, we believe that we have the right product ecosystem to maximize this opportunity.
Laboratories and Research
Customer loyalty. Loyalty is driven by long standing relationships, customer hesitancy to switch suppliers, high switching costs and limited competition globally. We believe we can benefit from price growth in most of our markets. In addition, our business is well protected by consistent replacement cycles on installed base.
Nuclear
Our legacy in the nuclear industry positions us to capitalize on the growth in demand for radiation detection, measurement, analysis and monitoring products and services in each phase of the nuclear life cycle, as outlined in the chart below.

We provide essential products and services to NPPs throughout the entire life cycle of a plant: from construction and operation to decommissioning and decontamination. For example, we provide:

•Radiation measurement and monitoring solutions, such as detection portals, environmental monitors and dosimetry systems that are typically installed in nuclear facilities during construction and are replaced or upgraded 
during the entire lifetime of the reactors, in particular upon life extensions. This provides recurring revenue opportunities as customers must replace and upgrade components and services during this timeframe,

•Reactor instrumentation and control detectors that are typically installed in nuclear facilities during construction and are replaced or upgraded regularly. In addition, there are opportunities to provide more comprehensive upgrades of reactor instrumentation and control detector systems in certain existing reactors to facilitate up-rating,

•Measurement and expertise services including technical expertise and experienced staff to help customers address their nuclear measurement needs in every step of the measurement process from planning to operation to wind-down,

•Imaging systems and cameras for all stages of the nuclear lifecycle, from construction through operation, to decommissioning and waste management, and
•Waste management systems that are used during the lifetime of the reactors and are essential, in particular, in any decontamination and decommissioning project.
We believe the following dynamics support the sustainability of our existing business and will drive new sources of organic growth.
Predictable upgrade, replacement and retirement cycles. Our radiation detection, measurement, analysis and monitoring products and systems have predictable life spans, typically ranging from four to twenty-five years. Our complex monitoring systems typically require at least one comprehensive upgrade during their useful life to optimize their functionality. In addition, many of our products require replacement parts, components and service due to normal wear during their useful lives.
Aging installed base. The existing global installed base of nuclear reactors has a median age of 34 years. This aging installed base requires frequent product replacements and upgrades over an operating life cycle that generally ranges from 40 to 80 years. Furthermore, as reactors reach the end of their useful lives, the onset of a multi-year “decommissioning” process represents a further revenue opportunity in the reactor life cycle for our products.
Increased decontamination and decommissioning activity and stricter environmental regulation. The total number of NPP shutdowns under decontamination and decommissioning is expected to increase over the next decade, with largest amount of expected plant shutdowns potentially in the U.S. market. In Europe, the UK represents the highest share of expected shutdowns as the operating fleet ages and passes the license extension period.
Large installed base of “orphaned” products and systems. Most currently operating reactors were commissioned prior to 1990. Operators of many aging NPPs often must consider new suppliers to meet their detection needs as many of the suppliers of legacy radiation detection, measurement, analysis and monitoring systems no longer service the nuclear industry.
Dosimetry outsourcing. NPPs have historically managed the majority of their dosimetry service requirements internally. However, the cost benefits of outsourcing these services have become increasingly attractive to NPP operators as they focus on improving profitability and enhancing service.
New build opportunity. We expect the construction of new nuclear reactors worldwide to provide opportunities across our product and service offerings. The nuclear industry is experiencing robust growth in activity related to new reactor builds. According to the WNA, in January 2023, there were 58 reactors under construction and 445 planned or proposed. This growth is occurring internationally and our global footprint positions us to capitalize on these opportunities. Since the early stages of reactor development generally represent a material share of our revenue opportunity over the life cycle of a reactor, we are positioned to benefit from increased global reactor construction. In addition, as new plants are added to the global nuclear fleet, we believe our recurring revenue opportunity associated with replacements, spares, software, services and system upgrades will continue to increase as we are well-positioned with customers due to our incumbent position.
Defense
Focus on military personnel. Global militaries must contend with radiological threats and the difficulties of protecting soldiers and monitoring areas of enemy engagement. The combination of our active dosimeters and telemetry technology provides a differentiated solution that addresses the radiation detection needs of modern militaries.
Increased civil defense spending on radiation detection. Civil defense and homeland security organizations are focused on preventing the illicit transportation of radiological materials across borders. The commercial application of our radiation detection expertise positions us to benefit from government spending on detection technologies.
Enhanced event specific security. The visibility of high profile events and venues has increased their value as targets of terrorist activity. In response, security spending at events, such as the Olympic Games, has increased, as has the utilization of radiation detection technology, providing an expanding market opportunity for our products.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following competitive strengths will enable us to maintain our position and capitalize on growth opportunities in our end markets:
Trusted ionizing radiation detection and measurement provider. Our end markets, including the medical, defense and nuclear industries, are highly regulated and require compliance with strict product specifications. Our track record enables us to gain market share across our product and service offerings. We and our predecessor companies have served the radiation detection measurement, analysis and monitoring needs of our customers for over 60 years, having developed trusted, recognized brands supported by our tradition of technical excellence, product reliability and customer service. We believe we have a leadership position in 14 of the 17 market segments we serve. In addition, we have leveraged our ionizing detection expertise to develop new applications for our core historical markets and to expand into adjacent markets through acquisitions.
Broad and complementary product and service portfolio. We are one of relatively few companies to offer ionizing radiation detection and measurement products and services to satisfy customer requirements throughout the medical and industrial markets. Our comprehensive product line supports virtually all radiation detection and monitoring needs associated with these markets. As a result, we believe that we have consistently gained market share as some of our key customers rationalize their supply chain. Furthermore, our portfolio provides us with a natural opportunity to cross-sell our products and services to our customers. As a result, we have a diversified portfolio across end markets and geographies.
Large installed base driving recurring revenue. We possess longstanding customer relationships in all of our end markets. We believe our QA products are used by the vast majority of cancer treatment centers in the United States and in the majority of such centers globally. This drives recurring revenue and opportunities for cross sales from our other activities. Our products were also installed at the vast majority of the addressable installed base of active nuclear power reactors globally, which have a median age of about 34 years. This installed base drives recurring revenue through replacement and service cycles associated with our offerings and the typical 40 to 80 year operating life cycle of an NPP. The length and quality of supplier relationships are important customer buying criteria due to high switching costs and the importance of proven product reliability. In addition, we maintain relationships with global military and government organizations that value operating longevity and technological expertise. For example, our products have been sold to 19 of the 30 NATO militaries as well as the U.S. Departments of Energy, State, Defense and Homeland Security. Our customers’ focus on personnel protection drives their recurring expenditures on service, recalibration and product upgrades in our defense end market. In the laboratories and research markets, we have developed relationships with certain customers over the past 50 years, gaining their loyalty based on product performance and customer services. Such relationships provide us with recurrent revenues when our customers upgrade and replace their existing installed base.
Technical complexity creates high barriers to entry. Across our end markets, we design our products to meet demanding customer specifications, qualifications and regulatory requirements. In many circumstances, we design our products to be compatible with highly complex facilities and operate effectively in harsh environments. Replicating our products is difficult given underlying technical specifications. In addition, customers generally work with their incumbent suppliers to service, maintain and replace equipment over product lifetime resulting in a natural barrier to entry.
Global footprint designed to meet local customer needs. Our global footprint, augmented by our established network of suppliers and distributors, enables us to be responsive to our customers and provide locally customized solutions. We operate facilities in 12 countries, accommodating the desire of certain of our customers to procure products and services from local providers. Sales to customers outside of the United States and Canada accounted for approximately 36% of total revenue for fiscal 2022. We believe that our established global infrastructure provides a scalable platform to meet the growing worldwide demand for our products and services.
Proven M&A strategy and track record of integrating acquisitions. We have been built through successive mergers and acquisitions. Since 2016, we have acquired and integrated fifteen companies. Through these acquisitions, we have developed tools and experience across deal sourcing, modeling and integrating acquired companies. We have a business 
ecosystem in place to identify and act upon cost saving opportunities as well as the ability to leverage our scale platform to capture cross-selling opportunities. 
Seasoned management team complemented by highly skilled engineers. We are led by an experienced management team with a mix of private sector and government experience across different industries and functions. Our senior management team is complemented by an engineering and research and development organization of 411 scientists, engineers and technicians as of December 31, 2022. A number of our employees are participants in international and U.S. standards setting organizations related to radiation detection in the nuclear, defense and medical end markets. Through these activities, we help define the setting of standards and preview changes that impact our products, customers and end markets.
Our Strategy
Our objective is to continue enhancing our position as a global provider of radiation detection, measurement, analysis and monitoring products and services for the global medical and industrial end markets. We intend to achieve this through the following strategies:
Exploit under-penetrated market opportunities. We believe that we can exploit historically under-penetrated segments of our end markets by leveraging our existing positions across our major product categories. For example, we have leveraged our technical expertise to develop and commercialize innovative products to increase sales in the U.S. dosimetry services market and in the radiotherapy quality assurance market, and we have expanded our radiation monitoring solutions offering by leading integrated offers with other key suppliers for some nuclear new build projects in Europe to increase our scope of supply and gain share in the nuclear market.
Expand addressable market. We believe that substantial opportunities exist for us to expand our addressable market by marketing our products and services to customers in new geographic regions; providing products and services to customers moving to an outsource model; entering markets where the government is privatizing services; introducing new applications for existing technologies and pursuing strategic acquisitions.

•Geographic expansion. Although we have sold products and services to customers in over 130 countries historically, we believe we have additional opportunities in certain international markets. For example, in India, a market we currently serve through local partners, we intend to leverage our relationships with leading reactor design firms to capitalize on the opening of the nuclear end market to U.S. and European firms. Another such market is the European dosimetry services market. Through acquisitions, we have developed our presence in the Netherlands and Germany, and we plan to continue expanding into other European countries. Other markets for expansion include the Middle East, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where we intend to increase our presence by leveraging relationships with local partners.

•Customer outsourcing. We believe we will continue to capitalize on customer outsourcing within the nuclear end market. Within the United States, several NPP operators have recently outsourced their dosimetry services in order to reduce costs. We have been able to benefit from economies of scale as well as advantages in materials procurement and processing technology to provide enhanced dosimetry services to many of these NPPs at a lower cost.

•Service privatization. In regions outside the United States, dosimetry services have historically been provided by government agencies. However, privatization of dosimetry services is occurring in some regions, such as Europe. As illustrated by our acquisitions in the Netherlands and Germany, providers seek to reduce costs and benefit from enhanced service offerings. This provides us with an opportunity to leverage our expertise and North American service experience, where we have demonstrated a strong track record of success, to expand market share in other geographies.

•Expand into new end markets. We periodically review our adjacent markets and identify opportunities for expansion. For example, we have developed a new personal radiation detector, or PRD, called Accurad to expand our presence in the civil services markets such as the police and fire departments. We have also entered in the nuclear imaging and radiotherapy markets through the acquisitions of Capintec, Biodex, Sun Nuclear, and CIRS. We entered the command-and-control cybersecurity solutions markets through the acquisition of Secure Integrated Solutions (SIS) in August 2022. 

•New applications for existing technologies. A portion of our development effort is focused on adapting existing technologies to alternative applications. For example, we have adapted the technology used for the medical and 
nuclear markets to develop the Mirion Battlefield Dosimeter which is currently being deployed by the U.S. Army and the U.S. Navy.
Develop new products and services. We believe that significant near-term opportunities exist for us to develop new products and services by capitalizing on our understanding of our customers’ needs and requirements. Cross pollination of technologies between end markets also drives new growth opportunities. For example, we created a new product called evrCAM to meet the needs of the radiation oncology market by leveraging our core technology from decades of experience in radiation tolerant cameras for the nuclear power industry. In addition, a component of our strategy is to continue to enhance products such as SunCHECK and SunScan in our Medical segment.
Continuously improve our cost structure and productivity. As we continue to grow our business, we have implemented a coordinated program of ongoing operating improvements, such as optimizing our manufacturing footprint, rationalizing excess costs and minimizing working capital requirements. We are continuously implementing our business system principles to challenge our practices and improve our performance across all our businesses. For example, we have optimized and simplified our footprint by transferring the activities from our facilities in Loches, France, certain activities in our Irvine, California facility and certain activities in our Shirley, New York facility to other Company sites to achieve operational synergies. Our global procurement team also delivers value across the business from sourcing of key materials and services to supply chain design.
Pursue strategic acquisitions and other transactions. We have successfully integrated acquisitions to augment our organic growth. We were formed by the merger of Global Dosimetry Solutions, or GDS, Imaging and Sensing Technologies, or IST, and Synodys in 2005. In 2016, we acquired Canberra Industries. Between October 2018 and December 2022, we acquired thirteen companies, with the objective of complementing our portfolio, reinforcing our supply chain and expanding into new markets such as nuclear imaging and radiotherapy. Since then, we have effectively integrated these businesses, creating a global platform of ionizing radiation detection and measurement solutions. We continuously monitor potential acquisitions and intend to further complement our organic growth with selective acquisitions that enhance our existing products and services, strengthen our position with existing customers and enable us to expand into new markets. From time to time we also divest businesses as part of a process to streamline our operations and focus our resources on certain more strategic markets.

Backlog and Deferred Contract Revenue
Total backlog represents committed but undelivered contracts and purchase orders at period end. Backlog excludes maintenance-related activity and agreements that do not represent firm purchase orders. Customer agreements that contain cancellation for convenience terms are generally not reflected in backlog until firm purchase orders are received. Backlog is not a complete measure of our future business due to these customer agreements. Our customers may experience project or funding delays or cancel orders due to factors beyond our control. If customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, whether due to fluctuations in their business needs or purchasing budgets or other reasons, our sales will be adversely affected and we may not realize the revenue we expect to generate from our backlog or, if realized, the revenue may not translate into profit. We estimate approximately 10%-15% of our backlog at any point in time is related to contracts that are unfunded and may be at risk for cancellation if funding is not appropriated. Backlog can fluctuate significantly due to the timing of large project awards. In addition, annual or multi-year contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the long-term nature of the contracts.
Deferred contract revenue represents prepayments from customers, including milestone or installment payments, on projects for which services have commenced, as well as unbilled amounts attributable to services rendered and products constructed associated with customer contracts for which revenue is not able to be recognized.
Information on backlog and deferred contract revenue follows (in millions):

 | Successor | | Predecessor
 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021 | | June 30, 2021
Backlog | $ | 737.4 | $ | 747.5 | $ | 715.8
Deferred contract revenue | $ | 83.0 | $ | 73.0 | $ | 50.4 

Approximately 57% of our backlog is expected to be recognized in calendar year 2023. 

Competition
The global markets for our products and services are competitive and continually evolving. Within each of our operating segments, we encounter a variety of competitors, ranging from small independent companies providing niche solutions to larger multi-national corporations providing a broader set of products and services to our targeted end markets. We believe that the principal bases upon which we compete in our target end markets include product quality and reliability, technical capability and product qualification, strength of customer relationships, customer service and price. In particular, customers in the defense and nuclear end markets tend to emphasize product quality and reliability, technical capability and strength of supplier relationships, while customers in the medical end markets, in particular for passive dosimetry products and services, tend to make purchasing decisions based on a combination of brand recognition, price, service and reliability.
We believe the primary competitors in each of our segments are as follows:

•Medical: Landauer (Fortive), PTW, IBA, Standard Imaging, Comecer and LAP

Research and Development
Our research and development efforts allow us to introduce new products to the marketplace, fulfill specific customer needs and continue to meet qualification requirements and other evolving regulatory standards. Our Medical and Industrial segments are committed to both technology research and product development to fulfill their strategic objectives and are supported by our engineering and research and development organization consisting of about 135 software engineers, 276 scientists, technicians, and other engineers, representing approximately 14% of our total workforce, as of December 31, 
2022. A number of these individuals participate in international standards setting organizations and committees. We engage in research and development activities at most of our facilities worldwide.
Our research and development expenses were $30.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, $6.7 million for the Successor Period from October 20, 2021 through December 31, 2021, $10.3 million for the Predecessor Stub Period from July 1, 2021 through October 19, 2021, and $29.4 million, $15.9 million for fiscal 2021 and, 2020 respectively. We conduct these efforts through a mix of in-house research, collaboration with academia, customers and regulatory authorities as well as selected outsourcing through external vendors. The scope and extent of the outsourced portion of research and development activities vary by segment but typically, critical hardware design, software development and project management activities are conducted in-house while specialized services such as consulting services, algorithm design, thermal analysis, complex modeling and calculations and testing services are provided by third parties.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products and services through our direct sales organization and indirectly through our global network of independent, third-party sales representatives and distributors. Our internal sales team is organized by operating segment and end market to provide a higher level of service and understanding of our customers’ unique needs. We have 48 sales offices throughout North America, Europe and Asia, and as of December 31, 2022, our sales and marketing personnel consisted of 264 employees, which represents approximately 9% of our total workforce.
We derive a portion of our revenue from sales of our products and services through channel partners, such as independent sales representatives and distributors. In particular, our independent sales representatives are an important source of sales leads for us and augment our internal resources in remote geographies. We sell through distributors in situations in which our customers prefer to purchase from a local business entity or purchase in smaller volume.
Our marketing activities include participation in many trade shows worldwide across our defense, medical and nuclear end markets. We advertise in technical journals, publish articles in leading industry periodicals and utilize direct mail campaigns.
Except when prevented by exceptional circumstances (for example, the COVID-19 crisis), we periodically host seminars and participate in trade shows. For example, we host the annual Mirion Connect Seminar, where customers participate in a variety of programs designed to exchange ideas and discuss occupational challenges. The event also brings together key channel partners and vendors to strengthen our sales and marketing network. Attendees gain insight into our product plans and participate in interactive sessions that give them the opportunity to better understand our current suite of products and services as well as provide feedback on our product roadmap.
Our Customers
Our principal customers include hospitals, clinics and urgent care facilities, dental offices, veterinary offices, radiation treatment facilities, OEMs for radiation therapy, laboratories, military organizations, government agencies, industrial companies, power and utility companies, reactor design firms and NPPs. We have long-standing relationships with our customers. For the Predecessor Stub Period from July 1, 2021 through October 19, 2021 and the Successor Period from October 20, 2021 through December 31, 2021 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 no customer accounted for greater than 6% of our consolidated revenue, our top five customers together accounted for approximately 14%, 13% and 13% of our consolidated revenue, respectively, and our top ten customers represented approximately 20%, 19% and 19% of our consolidated revenue, respectively.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
Given the diversity of our products, we employ numerous manufacturing techniques, including high-volume process manufacturing, discrete manufacturing, cellular manufacturing and hybrid approaches. Our production personnel engage in manufacturing, procurement and logistics activities. Our production activities are located in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Belgium, Estonia, Finland and the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2022, our production personnel consisted of 1,652 employees, which represents approximately 58% of our total workforce.
Our manufacturing activities are focused mainly on the production of the core value-add devices and components of our products, while non-core components and sub-assemblies are generally outsourced. This strategy enables us to protect important intellectual property and trade secrets while minimizing the time, cost and effort to produce commoditized components. Most of the time, the design, assembly and integration of the components are performed in-house, allowing our engineers to customize the products according to customer specifications. For highly engineered nuclear products, production volumes are typically low. For other product lines, such as, the DMC 3000 Electronic Dosimeter, the Mirion 
Battlefield Dosimeter, Accurad PRD and the Instadose dosimeter, production volumes tend to be higher. We apply rigorous quality control processes and calibrate radiation detection devices internally, leading to high quality standards and customization capabilities. Most of our production sites are certified to production quality standards such as those of ISO 9001, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (10 C.F.R. 50 Appendix B) and the American Society of Engineers (ASME NQA-1).
The principal materials used in our manufacturing processes are commodities that are available from a variety of sources. The key metal materials used in our manufacturing processes include precious metals (such as rhodium), tungsten, copper, aluminum, magnesium products, steel, stainless steel and various alloys, which are formed into parts such as detectors, sensors, metal housings and frames, and cable assemblies. The key non-metal materials used in our manufacturing processes include amorphous and crystalline scintillator materials, ceramics, epoxies, silicon and fused silica, polyethylene, polyurethane and injection molded plastic parts and components such as lenses, monitors, sensors, dosimeters, electronic boards, detectors and cables.
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
We are committed to create positive change through sustainable and responsible operations. In 2022, we published our Vendor Code of Conduct outlining the ethical and labor standards expected of our supply chain partners. We plan to continue to add policies and disclosures to further our sustainability goals which we believe will advance our position as both an innovative company and a competitor in our industries.
Corporate responsibility and employee safety are at the core of our business strategy and we continue to align this strategy with our ESG priorities. We are focused on initiatives across the organization, including:
•Vendor and Supply Chain Oversight
•Human and Labor Rights
•Product and Service Safety
•Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)
•Human Capital Management (HCM)
•Ethics and Compliance 
•Environmental Impact
We are committed to robust oversight of ESG issues. Our Board of Directors has direct oversight of ESG, including climate risk considerations, through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, working in collaboration with the Audit and Compensation Committees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is briefed by the Executive team on a quarterly basis and provides corresponding updates to the full Board of Directors. 
Human Capital Resources
We are committed to our people and aim to be an employer of choice in the industries in which we operate. Our culture is team-based and progressive; our core values are central to how we operate as a company. Engaged, skilled, and diverse employees are vital to our mission of harnessing the strength of our expertise in ionizing radiation for the greater good of humanity. We are furthering our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture by promoting diversity and employee engagement across our company. 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 2,872 full-time and part-time employees. We also use temporary or contract workers who totaled approximately 112 as of December 31, 2022, on a full-time equivalent basis. Of these, approximately 1,410 were employees in the United States and 1,462 were employees outside of the United States. Some of our operations are subject to union contracts, with 3 unions active in the United States as of December 31, 2022. Approximately 1.3% of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that attracts and retains exceptional talent. We value teamwork, practicing intellectual honesty and candor, with a clear focus on the situation, not the individual. We support a diversity of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives in our workforce and promote an engaging workplace that 
encourages participation and inclusion of all employees. To promote inclusion, we conduct regular workplace harassment and diversity and inclusion training for all employees. 
We are intent on maintaining diverse representation at all levels of our company, and our Corporate Governance Guidelines reflect our policy to include women and minorities in the initial pool of candidates when selecting new director nominees.
Employee Engagement
We regularly collect employee engagement surveys to collect feedback, better understand and improve employees' experience and identify opportunities to continually strengthen our culture. We communicate frequently through town halls, emails and other communication platforms. We mandate quarterly check-ins between employees and their managers as key human capital measures and objectives. We want to know what is working well, what we can do better and how well our employees understand and are practicing our cultural values.
Employee Compensation and Benefits
We require a talented workforce and are committed to providing total rewards that are market-competitive and performance-based, driving innovation and operational excellence. Our compensation programs, practices and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance that aligns with, and drives, stockholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the relevant market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance.
Another part of our strategy to attract and retain high-performing employees is providing comprehensive, affordable, and competitive benefits. This includes medical and dental plan options, flexible spending accounts, dependent care, and retirement plans.
Training and Development
Human capital development underpins our efforts to execute our strategy and continue to design, manufacture and market innovative products and services. The professional development of our employees is critical to this success. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, including but not limited to mentoring, product and sales training, as well as compliance training including on the topics of cybersecurity and other workplace safety training.
Health and Safety
As a company that manufactures devices to keep others safe, we place great focus on the safety of our own employees. Safety is a key consideration in our manufacturing processes. All facilities are expected to comply with local safety laws and regulations. Additionally, each site maintains comprehensive safety programs, including corrective action processes and emergency response plans. Employees undergo regular health and safety training to ensure compliance with, and communication of, safety policies and procedures. Occupational health and safety incidents are reported to our Conduct, Compliance and Ethics Committee, which monitors safety performance across the Company. We are continuously assessing risk and looking to improve our processes in an effort to prevent safety incidents.
Intellectual Property
The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies, information, processes and know-how. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to protect our proprietary products, methods, documentation and other technology.
As of December 31, 2022, we own approximately 72 issued U.S. utility patents, 68 issued foreign utility patents (including in Canada, the European Union, Russia, China and Japan), 7 pending U.S. utility non-provisional patent applications, 12 pending foreign utility patent applications (including in the European Union and France) including pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent applications. These issued patents are expected to expire between 2023 to 2038 and these pending applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2039 to 2040, in each case without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees. We do not expect the expiration of any of the patents that are scheduled to expire in 2023 to have a material impact on its business. These patents include two co-owned issued U.S. patents and three co-owned issued foreign patents. We also hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses related to patents and other intellectual property of third parties. We also own trademark registrations or registration applications in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Medical Segment
As of December 31, 2022, we own approximately 37 issued U.S. utility patents, 29 issued foreign utility patents (including in the European Union, China, Japan and Canada), 5 pending U.S. non-provisional utility patent applications and 4 pending foreign utility patent application in the European Union that include claims directed to products in our medical segment, 
including our cancer diagnostics and therapeutics QA, occupational dosimetry, medical imaging and nuclear medicine equipment products. These issued patents are expected to expire between 2022 to 2038 and these pending applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2039 to 2040, in each case without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees.
Industrial Segment
As of December 31, 2022, we own approximately 35 issued U.S. utility patents, 39 issued foreign utility patents (including in the European Union, Canada, Russia and Japan), 2 pending U.S. non-provisional utility patent application and 8 pending foreign utility patent applications (including pending PCT patent applications) that contain claims directed to products in our industrial segment, including our alpha/beta counting instruments, contamination and clearance monitors, gamma spectroscopy software and detector systems, NDA and waste measurement systems, portable radiation measurement instruments, radiation monitoring systems and reactor instrumentation and controls products. Our issued patents are expected to expire between 2022 to 2037 and our pending applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2032 to 2040, in each case without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees.
In many instances (for both the Medical and Industrial Segments), we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. Due to the long useful life of certain aspects of our technology, we believe that the patent registration process, which requires public disclosure of patented claims and inventions, could harm our competitive position. We differentiate our products and technologies primarily through our proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, equipment designs, testing and other procedures. Our employees are generally required to assign to us all of the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us, either through written agreements or by operation of law, depending on the jurisdiction. Where appropriate, we require third parties with whom we deal to enter into agreements with us that address issues of confidentiality and intellectual property. For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties affecting our business related to our protection of intellectual property and other proprietary information, please see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks.”
Seasonality
General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and our business experiences seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that we serve. While we believe that we are poised for growth from governmental customers in both of our segments, our revenues and cash flows from government customers are influenced, particularly in the short-term, by budgetary cycles. This impact can be either positive or negative. However, as a whole, we believe we are not subject to significant seasonality. For more information about the trends that impact our business and financial results, see “Part I, Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations." 
Environmental Matters
We are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety and pollution-control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We use, generate, discharge and dispose of hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes at some of our facilities in connection with our product development, testing and manufacturing activities. In addition, some of our facilities are located on properties with a history of use involving hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes and may be contaminated.
Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA (also known as the Superfund Law) and its state analogues, we may be subject to joint and several liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties that we currently or previously owned or operated, or at sites at which waste we generated was disposed, even if the contamination was not caused by us or was legal at the time it occurred. Although we have not incurred any material liabilities in connection with contamination, we may be required to make expenditures for environmental remediation in the future with respect to contamination at our or our predecessors’ former or current facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites under these laws. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, or RCRA, provides a comprehensive framework for the regulation of hazardous and solid waste which applies to our operations. RCRA prohibits improper hazardous waste disposal and imposes criminal and civil liability for failure to comply with its requirements. The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, or, TSCA provides a comprehensive framework for the management by the EPA of over 60,000 commercially produced chemical substances, some of which are used by our operations. The Clean Water Act 
regulates the discharge of pollutants into certain waters and may require us to apply for and obtain discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring and, under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. The Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA provides for the establishment of standards governing workplace safety and health requirements, including setting permissible exposure levels for hazardous chemicals. We must follow OSHA standards, including the preparation of material safety data sheets, hazardous response training and process safety management, as well as various record-keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements.
Our operations outside the United States are subject to similar, and sometimes more stringent, laws and regulations. For example, an EU directive relating to the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, or RoHS directive, and a directive relating to waste electrical and electronic equipment, or WEEE directive, have been implemented in EU member states. Among other things, the RoHS directive restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in the manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment and the WEEE directive requires producers of electrical goods to be responsible for the collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of these goods. China and South Korea and certain other jurisdictions have laws similar to the RoHS and WEEE directives. In addition, the EU has a regulation regarding the registration, authorization and restriction of chemical substances in industrial products, or REACH. REACH and other regulations requires us or our suppliers to substitute certain chemicals contained in our products with substances the EU considers less dangerous. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks—We could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws.” 
Regulation
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including but not limited to those of the United States, Canada, the EU, the EU member states and the People’s Republic of China, that impose regulatory systems that govern many aspects of our operations. In addition, these jurisdictions impose trade controls requirements that restrict trade to comply with applicable export controls and economic sanctions laws and requirements, and legal requirements that are intended to curtail bribery and corruption. These laws and regulations apply by virtue of the nature of our industry, end markets and products, as well as the range of potential uses of our products, the origin of the technology incorporated into our products, and the jurisdictions in which we produce and sell our products.
The multi-jurisdictional legal and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to extensive and changing laws and regulations administered by various national, regional and local governmental agencies both within and outside the United States.
We are a federal government contractor and, as such, we are subject to Executive Order 11246 and other relevant laws and regulations. As part of our compliance obligations, we implement on an annual basis an affirmative action plan and program which, in part, include our good faith efforts to achieve in our workforce full utilization of qualified women and minorities. In addition, we have in place an affirmative action plan with respect to disabled individuals, as well as Vietnam era, disabled or other veterans.
Some of the U.S. laws affecting our operations include, but are not limited to, the Atomic Energy Act, or "AEA", the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, or "ERA", as well as the state laws governing radiation control in the states of New York, Georgia, California, Connecticut, Tennessee, New Jersey, Florida and Wisconsin, each as from time to time amended. We are also subject to a variety of U.S. federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, the Worker Adjustment and Restructuring Notification Act, or "WARN Act", which requires employers to give affected employees at least 60 days’ notice of a plant closing or mass layoff, and other regulations related to working conditions, wage-hour pay, overtime pay, employee benefits, anti-discrimination and termination of employment. We are also subject to the employment and labor laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions where many of our employees are located. The classified work that we currently perform at one of our U.S. facilities subjects us to the industrial security regulations of the Department of Defense and other federal agencies that are designed to safeguard against unauthorized access by foreigners and others to classified and other sensitive information.
In the United States, the AEA and ERA authorize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or "NRC", and state authorities where applicable, to regulate the receipt, possession, use and transfer of radioactive materials. The NRC, and state authorities where applicable, sets regulatory standards for worker protection and public exposure to radioactive materials or wastes to which we are required to adhere in our operations that use radioactive materials in research and development, product manufacture, testing and calibration.
Certain of our products require the use of radioactive sources. For certain of our products, these radioactive sources are often obtained by our customers directly from third-party providers, and for others, we directly incorporate these radioactive sources into our products. Certain of our reactor instrumentation and control equipment and systems for NPPs 
incorporate radioactive materials. In all such cases, licenses for radioactive sources and materials are provided by the appropriate regulatory authority in the relevant jurisdiction and such authorities may be at the state or national level. For example, at our sites in the United States that handle radioactive sources or materials, the appropriate licenses are issued by state-level authorities which are, respectively, the New York State Department of Health, Georgia Department of Natural Resources, California Department of Public Health, Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, Florida Department of Health and Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Similarly, licenses for radioactive sources and materials are maintained at each of our international sites where such licenses are required, including in Belgium, China, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Germany, France, Japan and the Netherlands.
While the specific process and criteria for receiving a license differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it generally involves an application process in which we: identify a person or persons who have appropriate training and experience to be a health physics/radiation safety officer; specify the radioactive sources or materials sought to be licensed, their physical form (i.e., sealed or unsealed) and maximum possession limits on the amount of each type of radioactive element or compound sought under the license; specify their intended use (e.g., calibration, testing, quality assurance, manufacturing); and, set forth written policies and procedures to ensure that we have adequate measures in place to ensure health and safety. These policies and procedures typically must be designed to ensure worker, workplace, and public safety, including emergency plans; set forth the proper handling, control and security of radioactive sources or materials on site; detail any disposal or decommissioning considerations; and adequately train personnel at the site in proper access to, and handling of, radioactive sources or materials.
The particular license requirements in a given jurisdiction are normally tailored to the specific radioactive elements or compounds involved, their physical form, and possession limits. Once authorities complete their application review and any required follow-up, the authority issues the site a license which imposes specific on-going compliance obligations that typically include requirements for us to pay periodic licensing fees, submit periodic written compliance reports, and agree to periodic site inspections by regulators, which may be announced or unannounced. Once a site has an existing license, the process for expanding or reducing the licensing scope generally is simpler than applying for a new license.
We have numerous licenses in effect at our various facilities in the United States, Canada, Finland, Germany, France, China, Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium and Estonia and the expiration dates of individual licenses differ by their term and effective date. Typical license terms range from two to five years, with authorities in some jurisdictions (e.g., Finland and Bavaria, Germany) issuing licenses that are perpetual subject to our on-going license compliance. For radioactive materials licenses in the United States, preapproval is generally required from the NRC or a U.S. State that has signed an agreement with the NRC authorizing such State to regulate certain radioactive materials within such State (an "Agreement State") before a direct or indirect transfer of a license, whether done through a sale or acquisition, restructuring, or other method. While specific regulations vary by jurisdiction, generally a license may be terminated by the regulatory authority immediately upon a finding of a substantial safety violation or other material violation of licensing requirements. For more minor violations, regulatory authorities typically provide the licensee with a written statement of deficiency or notice of violation stating required remediation steps, or requesting the licensee to identify corrective actions, and a demand for proof of remediation; depending on the severity of the violation, a re-inspection of the site may be performed by the authority to ensure adequate remedial steps have been completed.
In most cases, our various sites (including our predecessors) have held, maintained and (where required) renewed their licenses for a decade or more. In all cases, the licenses we require related to radioactive sources or materials are current and in force and, to the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any basis to expect that any existing licenses subject to periodic renewals will not be renewed.
As a supplier of equipment and systems to the nuclear power industry, we are subject to regulations promulgated by the NRC that are applicable to vendors. Owners of nuclear power plants in the United States are licensed to build, operate, and maintain those plants by the NRC. Their license and applicable NRC regulations require that they qualify their suppliers and contractors to ensure that the suppliers and contractors comply with NRC regulations. The NRC has a robust inspection regime for commercial nuclear plants, which includes verification that, for example, design, procurement, maintenance, and radiation protection programs comply with NRC safety and quality assurance regulations and requirements. 
Inspections of nuclear materials licensees are conducted frequently, in areas such as personnel training, radiation protection, and security of nuclear materials. Parts of the NRC’s inspection regime—including portions of 10 C.F.R. Part 21 on reporting of defects and noncompliance and Appendix B of 10 C.F.R. Part 50 related to Quality Assurance—are also directly applicable to contractors, suppliers, and other non-licensees. The NRC routinely conducts inspections at vendor sites on these matters and others. As a supplier to the nuclear power industry, we must demonstrate to our customers that we comply with NRC regulations related to quality assurance, reporting of defects and safety issues, security and control of personnel access and conduct. Section 170 of the AEA, which is also known as the Price-Anderson Act, supports the 
nuclear services industry by offering broad nuclear liability and insurance coverage and indemnification to commercial NPP operators and their suppliers, as well as Department of Energy, or DOE, contractors, for liabilities arising out of nuclear incidents at power plants licensed by the NRC and at DOE nuclear facilities. The indemnification authority of the NRC and DOE under the Price-Anderson Act was extended through 2025 by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Our nuclear power plant customers are covered by the nuclear liability insurance and indemnification provisions of the Price-Anderson Act. In addition, other jurisdictions have similar nuclear liability protection and indemnification regimes for nuclear facilities.
We deal with numerous U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and entities, including the U.S. military, the armed forces of many NATO countries, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Treasury, the NRC, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the corresponding governmental agencies and entities in the European Union and Canada. When working with these and other government agencies and entities, we must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost or pricing data in connection with various contract negotiations; impose acquisition regulations that define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various cost-based U.S. government contracts; and restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.
Export Controls
Our products and technologies are subject to export controls under the laws of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the member states of the European Union. Depending on a number of factors, including the specific product or technology, the origin of that product or technology, the destination, the end-user and the end-use, exports of our products and technologies may require export licenses, permits or other authorizations from government export control authorities. Whether we will be able to conclude proposed transactions involving products or technologies that are subject to those export licensing requirements will depend on the relevant government agency’s determination on whether the proposed transaction is consistent with the exporting country’s national security and foreign policy interests.
As examples of export control laws and regulations potentially applicable to our products and technologies, our products, when manufactured in or exported from the United States, are subject to export controls under the U.S. Department of Energy’s Part 810 regulations (10 C.F.R. Part 810) governing transfer of commercial nuclear technology and assistance, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"), the U.S. State Department’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"), or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC"), export licensing regulations in 10 C.F.R. Part 110 governing exports of nuclear materials and equipment. Canadian and EU export control regimes have separate, sometimes overlapping requirements, which must also be considered for a proper export compliance system.
We have implemented detailed export control compliance procedures, in the form of our Export Management and Control Program ("EMCP"), to identify those products, technologies and transactions for which export licenses, permits or other authorizations are required, and to assure that all transactions are handled in accordance with all applicable export control laws and regulations. Among other things, the Mirion EMCP includes (i) third party service provider screening of all parties against the various governments’ lists of prohibited, restricted and sanctioned parties; (ii) end-use reviews and certification procedures; (iii) monitoring regulatory announcements; and (iv) periodic reviews of applicable export control regulations in order to assure that the compliance procedures are up to date and properly maintained. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks—Legal compliance with import and export controls, as well as with sanctions, in the United States and other countries, is complex, and compliance restrictions and expenses could materially and adversely impact our revenue and supply chain.”
Economic Sanctions
Various United States laws and regulations implemented by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), impose economic sanctions on certain countries, business entities and individuals. Those OFAC economic sanctions regulations: (i) impose comprehensive commercial and financial embargoes on transactions directly and indirectly with Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria or the Crimean Region, and Russia or certain regions of Ukraine more recently, including any entity or person located in those jurisdictions; and (ii) include a substantial list of persons and entities that have been determined to be closely affiliated with the government of an embargoed country, engaged in or supporting international terrorism, trafficking in narcotics, engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or otherwise acting in a manner contrary to United States foreign policy interests. United States persons (i.e., United States citizens, permanent residents and companies) are generally prohibited from engaging in any transaction which involves any property or any interest in property in which an embargoed country, a person in an embargoed country or a person on the OFAC list of sanctioned parties has an interest. The prohibitions on engaging in transactions with Cuba 
and Iran also extend to foreign subsidiaries of United States companies. Moreover, no United States person may approve, ratify, participate in, or otherwise “facilitate” any offshore transaction between a foreign company and any country, entity or person that is sanctioned under the OFAC economic sanctions regulations. The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS"), keeps an Entity List and other sanctions-related lists that are separate from the OFAC requirements.
Violations of United States export control regulations or the OFAC economic sanctions regulations are punishable by criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, loss of export privileges, debarment from United States Government contracts and, in extreme cases, listing on the OFAC list of sanctioned parties. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks—Legal compliance with import and export controls, as well as with sanctions, in the United States and other countries, is complex, and compliance restrictions and expenses could materially and adversely impact our revenue and supply chain.”
Anti-Corruption Laws
We are subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"), the United Kingdom Bribery Act (the "UKBA"), and anti-corruption laws enacted in various other countries which implement the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (the "OECD"), Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Officials in International Business. Those laws generally prohibit any person or company from making payments to any “foreign official” for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining any other unfair or improper advantage.
In particular, the FCPA prohibits any publicly traded company, or issuer, and any domestic concern from paying or giving, or promising or offering to pay or give, any money or any other thing of value directly or indirectly to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining any business or obtaining any other unfair advantage. An issuer or domestic concern may be liable for penalties for violation of the FCPA if it make a payment, or provides any other thing of value, to a third party, such as a distributor, sales representative or other third party with knowledge that some or all of that money or thing of value will be paid or given to a foreign official for an improper purpose. In addition, the FCPA imposes upon issuers obligations to maintain complete and accurate books and records of account and to establish internal accounting controls, in order to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of “off books” accounts that might be used to fund improper payments to foreign officials.
Violations of the FCPA are punishable by criminal and civil fines and imprisonment and disgorgement of revenues derived from improper conduct. Any investigation or proceeding involving allegations of improper payments under the FCPA could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, standing with customers, particularly government customers, and/or our business reputation. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks—We must comply with the FCPA and analogous non-U.S. anti-bribery and anti-corruption statutes including the UKBA. Our or our sales representatives’ or distributors’ failure to comply with such laws could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”
Compliance Procedures
To address the compliance challenges presented by the foregoing laws and regulations, we have adopted and implemented compliance policies and detailed compliance procedures. Our commitment to compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations is memorialized in the Mirion Code of Ethics and Conduct, which sets forth our overall compliance policies and informs all of our employees of their compliance responsibilities. Our export controls and economic sanctions compliance policies are set forth in our EMCP and implemented at each of our sites via local procedures. Our compliance programs are reinforced with (i) ethics and compliance training for all employees; (ii) due diligence reviews of all prospective distributors, sales representatives and other third party intermediaries; (iii) detailed anti-corruption compliance contractual covenants in third-party agreements; (iv) detailed recordkeeping procedures; and (v) auditing of third parties’ business practices as needed.
Medical Device Regulation
We are required to register for permits and/or licenses with, obtain approvals from and comply with operating standards of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), the NRC, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the "HHS"), the European Medicines Agency (the "EMA"), the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (the "MHRA"), and other foreign agencies, and accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations we are conducting and the location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.
Many of our products in the medical end market, for instance our nuclear medicine products for cardiology, oncology, endocrinology, diagnostic radiology and radiation therapy; imaging products in the form of positioning devices, ultrasound tables and MRI stretchers; and our energy measurement products, including radiation monitoring and measuring instruments, are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars, and orders, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA"). We incur a number of costs associated with obtaining and maintaining the approval to market our products. Furthermore, the FDA conducts detailed inspections of and controls over our manufacturing, marketing, distribution, import and export, record keeping and storage and disposal practices, together with various post-marketing requirements.
Specifically, the FDCA requires these products, when sold in the United States, to be safe and effective for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations promulgated and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export, and record keeping for such products.
Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance (a pathway for the FDA to approve a new medical device for marketing) for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture, or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance and payment of an FDA user fee.
Any medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, state and certain other comparable foreign authorities. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA and other comparable foreign authorities, as well as audits by our notified body in the European Economic Area, or EEA, as described below. We are required to adhere to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices requirements, as set forth in the Quality Systems Regulation, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process.
We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including adverse event reporting requirements, which require that we review and report to the FDA and other comparable foreign authorities any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. Further, we are required to report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
Labeling, advertising and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and other comparable foreign authorities and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission and other foreign counterparts. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA, foreign regulators, or our notified bodies may not be promoted for undocumented, unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA, other U.S. agencies and other comparable foreign authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.
The FDA can withdraw marketing authorization for a medical device product if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Because our operations include the manufacture and distribution of nuclear medical products, we are also subject to regulation by the NRC and the departments of health of each state in which we operate, which leaves us with a complex collection of requirements to navigate.
Market access, sales and marketing of medical devices in non-U.S. countries are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. The time required to obtain approval for marketing a medical device in a foreign country could be longer or shorter than the time required by the FDA. Furthermore, the requirements are different in each country. For example in the EEA, a medical device must meet the Medical Devices Directive’s (the "MDD"), Essential Requirements or the Medical Devices Regulation’s (the "MDR"), General Safety and Performance Requirements, if certified from May 26, 2021. Before placing a medical device on the EEA market, the manufacturer must prepare a declaration of conformity, certifying that the device complies with the MDD/MDR, and must then affix the CE mark. The notified body typically audits and examines the device’s technical documentation, and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the relevant device before issuing a CE certificate. Following the issuance of this CE certificate, manufacturers may prepare the declaration of conformity and affix the CE mark to the devices covered by this CE certificate. Similar requirements apply in the UK. For access to the UK market, manufacturers must obtain a UKCA Certificate and affix a UKCA mark to their medical devices. However, the CE mark will be accepted in the UK until July 1, 2023.
The standard by which conformity with applicable standards and directives is measured is dependent upon the type and class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a notified body. In the European Union, or EU, the third party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system (currently ISO 13485), provisions of the MDD and specific testing of the manufacturer’s device. Further, the MDR came into effect in the European Union on May 26, 2021, which requires us to obtain certification against the MDR to include a CE mark on new products, or make significant changes to existing products.
We are subject to additional regulations in other foreign countries, including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom and the EU to sell our products. We intend that either we or our distributors will receive any necessary approvals or clearance prior to marketing our products in those international markets.
We are subject to various healthcare related laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing and sales and marketing practices, and the privacy and security of health information. In particular, the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration (including any kickback or bribe), directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Similar laws and regulations apply in many foreign countries.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), prohibits knowingly and willfully (1) executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, or (2) falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, also restricts the use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information, mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient identifiable health information, and requires the reporting of certain security breaches with respect to such information. Similar to the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Similar laws and regulations apply in many foreign countries.
The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program, knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly makes a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Similar laws and regulations apply in many foreign countries.
Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. Analogous U.S. state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, also may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements, and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers. Further, there are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to comply with the voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. Similar laws and regulations apply in many non-U.S. countries.
Privacy and Information Security Laws
In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, use transmit and otherwise process certain types of data, including personal information, which subjects us to certain privacy and information security laws in the United States and internationally, including, for example and depending on the particular activity, the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"), and other laws, rules and regulations designed to regulate the processing of personal information and for example reduce risks of identity theft. These laws impose obligations with respect to the collection, processing, storage, disposal, use, transfer, retention and disclosure of personal 
information. In addition, under certain of these laws, we must provide notice to individuals of our policies and practices for sharing personal information with third parties, provide advance notice of any changes to our policies and in some cases give individuals the right to prevent processing of their personal information and disclosure of it to third parties. Further, all 50 states in the United States have laws including obligations to provide notification of unauthorized acquisition of personal information to affected individuals, state officers and others. Some laws may also impose physical and electronic security requirements regarding the safeguarding of personal information. In order to comply with privacy and information security laws, we have confidentiality and information security standards and procedures in place for our business activities. Privacy and information security laws evolve regularly, and complying with these various laws, rules, regulations and standards, and with any new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws, could cause us to incur substantial costs that are likely to increase over time, requiring us to adjust our compliance program on an ongoing basis and presenting compliance challenges, change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and restrict the way products and services involving data are offered. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks—Any actual or perceived failure to comply with evolving data privacy and data security laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, both inside and outside of the United States, could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation or adverse publicity and could materially and adversely affect our business.”
