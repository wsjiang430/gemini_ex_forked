Overview and Industry Outlook
Both the market for drilling and production equipment and services and the Company’s business are substantially dependent on the condition of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on exploration, drilling and production operations. The level of capital expenditures has generally been dependent upon the prevailing view of future oil and gas prices, which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas, including worldwide economic activity, interest rates and the cost of capital, environmental regulation, tax policies and the ability and/or desire of OPEC and other producing nations to set and maintain production levels and prices. The Brent crude oil price reached a high of $115.19 per barrel in June 2014 and then began to drop sharply during 2015, and continued to drop in 2016, reaching a low of $26.01 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016, before rebounding to end the year at $54.96 per barrel. Oil prices began a slow recovery in 2017, with an average price of $54.15 compared to an average price of $43.67 in 2016. During 2018, crude oil prices fluctuated significantly, with a high of $86.07 per barrel and ending the year at a low of $50.57 per barrel. According to the December 2018 release of the Short-Term Energy Outlook published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the U.S. Department of Energy, Brent Crude oil prices averaged approximately $71.34 per barrel in 2018 and the price is forecasted to average $61.00 per barrel in 2019 and $65.00 per barrel in 2020. 
 On November 30, 2016, OPEC met and decided to cut production by approximately 1.2 million barrels per day. The reduced production helped to increase the average price per barrel between 2016 and 2017. Capital expenditures are also dependent on the cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas, the availability, expiration date and price of leases, the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves, technological advances and alternative opportunities to invest in onshore exploration and production operations. Oil and gas prices and the level of drilling and production activity have historically been characterized by significant volatility. Future declines in oil and gas prices may further adversely affect the willingness of some oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on exploration, drilling and production operations, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In its December 2018 Short-Term Energy Outlook, the EIA projected United States crude oil production averaged an estimated 10.9 million barrels per day in 2018, with an average of 11.5 million barrels per day in the month of November, and is forecasted to average 12.1 million barrels per day in 2019. 
Brent crude oil prices per barrel for the three-year period ended December 31, 2018 are summarized below:

 | Brent Crude Oil Prices
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
High | $ | 86.07 | | | $ | 66.80 | | $ | 54.96
Low | 50.57 | | | 43.98 | | | 26.01
Average | 71.34 | | | 54.15 | | | 43.67
Closing, December 31, | $ | 50.57 | | | $ | 66.73 | | $ | 54.96

The volatility in Brent crude oil prices over the past three years continues to have a significant effect on major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies’ capital expenditure budgets. The Company expects continued pressure in both crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as in the level of drilling and production related activities, particularly as they relate to offshore activities. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and gas may cancel or curtail programs, seek to renegotiate contract terms, including the price of products and services, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons. Lower drilling and production activity had a negative impact on the Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2018 and is expected to improve slightly in 2019. A prolonged delay in the recovery of commodity prices could also lead to further material impairment charges to tangible or intangible assets or otherwise result in a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—A material or extended decline in expenditures by the oil and gas industry could significantly reduce our revenue and income.”
Recent Developments
As a result of continued unfavorable offshore market conditions and low commodity prices, the Company engaged in a strategic review with a third-party firm in 2018. In conjunction with the strategic review, the Company adjusted its forecast for recovery to reflect a more delayed recovery in the offshore industry, with pre-downturn demand not returning until after 2025.

Additionally, the Company pursued a global transformation, which includes a reduction in workforce, realignment of facilities and restructuring of operations. We expect this transformation to allow us to maintain our global footprint in key markets, while supporting an integrated supply chain model that we expect to create more flexibility and allow us to continue serving our customers. The Company expects to complete the strategic restructuring by the end of 2019.
Products and Services
Dril-Quip’s revenues are generated from two sources: products and services. Product revenues are derived from the sale of drilling and production equipment. Service revenues are earned when the Company provides technical advisory assistance and rental tools during installation and retrieval of the Company’s products. Additionally, the Company earns service revenues when rework and reconditioning services are provided. In 2018, the Company derived 69% of its revenues from the sale of its products, 19% of its revenues from services and 12% of its revenues from leasing rental tools, compared to 77%, 14% and 9% for products, services and leasing rental tools in 2017, respectively, and 80%, 12% and 8% for products, services and leasing rental tools in 2016, respectively. Service and leasing revenues generally correlate to revenues from product sales because increased product sales typically generate increased demand for technical advisory assistance services during installation and rental of running tools. However, existing customer equipment can be used in certain circumstances, which creates demand for services with no correlating product sales. The Company has substantial international operations, with approximately 61% of its revenues derived from foreign sales in 2018, 55% in 2017 and 66% in 2016. Substantially all of the Company’s domestic revenue relates to operations in the U. S. Gulf of Mexico. Domestic revenue approximated 39% of the Company’s total revenues in 2018, 45% in 2017 and 34% in 2016.
Product contracts are typically negotiated and sold separately from service contracts. In addition, service contracts are not typically included in the product contracts or related sales orders and are not offered to the customer as a condition of the sale of the Company’s products. The demand for products and services is generally based on worldwide economic conditions in the oil and gas industry, and is not based on a specific relationship between the two types of contracts. Substantially all of the Company’s sales are made on a purchase order basis. Purchase orders are subject to change or termination at the option of the customer. In case of a change or termination, the customer is required to pay the Company for work performed and other costs necessarily incurred as a result of the change or termination.
Generally, the Company attempts to raise its prices as its costs increase. However, the actual pricing of the Company’s products and services is impacted by a number of factors, including global oil prices, competitive pricing pressure, the level of utilized capacity in the oil service sector, maintenance of market share, the introduction of new products and general market conditions.
Products
Dril-Quip designs, manufactures, fabricates, inspects, assembles, tests and markets subsea equipment, surface equipment and offshore rig equipment. The Company’s products are used primarily to explore for oil and gas from offshore drilling rigs, such as floating rigs and jack-up rigs, and for drilling and production of oil and gas wells on offshore platforms, tension leg platforms (TLPs), Spars and moored vessels such as FPSOs. TLPs are floating production platforms that are connected to the ocean floor via vertical mooring tethers. A Spar is a floating cylindrical structure approximately six or seven times longer than its diameter and is anchored in place. FPSOs are floating production, storage and offloading monohull moored vessels. The TIW products are used in the drilling and production for oil and gas both onshore and offshore.
Subsea Equipment. Subsea equipment is used in the drilling and production of offshore oil and gas wells around the world. Included in the subsea equipment product line are subsea wellheads, mudline hanger systems, specialty connectors and associated pipe, production riser systems, subsea production trees, liner hangers, safety valves, subsea control systems and subsea manifolds.
Subsea wellheads are pressure-containing vessels that are sometimes referred to as a “wellhead housing” and are made from forged and machined steel. A casing hanger, also made of steel, lands inside the wellhead housing and suspends casing (pipe) downhole. As drilling depth increases, successively smaller diameter casing strings are installed, each suspended by an independent casing hanger. Subsea wellheads are utilized when drilling from floating drilling rigs, either semi-submersible or drillship types, or TLPs and Spars. The Company’s flagship subsea wellhead, called the SS-15® Subsea Wellhead System, is rated for 15,000 psi internal pressure and is offered to the industry in a variety of configurations. The Company’s newest wellhead product, the SS-20TM BigBoreTM II-e Subsea Wellhead System, is designed to contain higher pressures (20,000 pounds per square inch (psi)) and provides the ability to reduce the number of casing strings in the well design by increasing load carrying and pressure capacities of casing hangers and associated installation tools.
Mudline hanger systems are used in jack-up drilling operations to support the weight of the various casing strings at the ocean floor while drilling a well. They also provide a method to disconnect the casing strings in an orderly manner at the ocean floor after the well has been drilled, and subsequently reconnect to enable production of the well by either tying it back vertically to a subsequently installed platform or by installing a shallow water subsea tree.
7

Large diameter weld-on specialty connectors (threaded or stab type) are used primarily in offshore wells drilled from floating drilling rigs, jack-up rigs, fixed platforms, TLPs and Spars. Specialty connectors join lengths of conductor or large diameter (16-inch or greater) casing. Specialty connectors provide a more rapid connection than other methods of connecting lengths of pipe. Connectors may be sold individually or as an assembly after being welded to sections of Company or customer supplied pipe. Dril-Quip’s weld-on specialty connectors are designed to prevent cross threading and provide a quick, convenient method of joining casing joints with structural integrity compatible with casing strength.
Production riser systems are generally designed and manufactured to customer specifications. Production risers provide a vertical conduit from the subsea wellhead up to a TLP, Spar or FPSO floating at the surface.
A subsea production tree is an assembly composed of valves, a wellhead connector, control equipment and various other components installed on a subsea wellhead or a mudline hanger system and used to control the flow of oil and gas from a producing well. Subsea trees may be used as stand alone satellite wells or multiple well template mounted and cluster arrangements. These types typically produce via a subsea gathering system of manifolds and flowlines to a central control point located on a platform, TLP, Spar or FPSO. The use of subsea production trees has become an increasingly important method for producing wells located in hard-to-reach deepwater areas or economically marginal fields located in shallower waters. The Company is an established manufacturer of complicated dual-bore production trees. In addition, Dril-Quip manufactures a patented single bore (SingleBoreTM) subsea completion system which features a hydraulic valve mechanism instead of a wireline-installed mechanism that allows the operator to plug the tubing hanger annulus remotely from the surface via a hydraulic control line and subsequently unplug it when the well is put on production. This mechanism eliminates the need for an expensive multibore installation and workover riser, thereby saving both cost and installation time. The patented horizontal bore (HorizontalBoreTM) subsea production component accommodates numerous completion configuration possibilities and features large vertical access drill-through for passage of drill-bits, submersible pumps, coil tubing strings and Dril-Quip's slimline casing hanger system. Dril-Quip’s subsea production trees are used in ultra-deepwater applications. These trees feature remote flowline and control connections, utilizing remotely operated intervention tools. The Company’s subsea production trees are generally custom designed and manufactured to customer specifications.
A subsea control system provides control of subsea trees, manifolds, ocean floor process equipment and pipeline protection equipment. Dril-Quip has developed a variety of subsea control systems, including fiber optic based multiplex control systems that provide real time access to tree functions and tree equipment status. The control system can be packaged for shallow water or deepwater applications. Dril-Quip also manufactures control systems used in the installation, retrieval and workover of production equipment.
A subsea manifold is a structure located on the ocean floor consisting of valves, flowline connections and a control module used to collect and control the flow of oil and gas from subsea wells for delivery to a floating production unit or terminal.
Downhole Tools. Downhole tools are primarily comprised of liner hangers, production packers, safety valves and specialty downhole tools. A liner hanger is used to hang-off and seal casing into a previously installed casing string in the well bore, and can provide a means of tying back the liner for production to surface. Dril-Quip has developed a state-of-the-art liner hanger system and has installed its liner hangers in a number of difficult well applications, resulting in improved industry recognition and market opportunities. In addition to liner hanger systems that are well suited for onshore use, TIW offers expandable liner hanger systems that are typically utilized in challenging environments such as deepwater or High Pressure, High Temperature (HPHT) applications.
A safety valve is used to provide a quick, sure shutoff in the drill string at the drill floor and prevent flow up the drill pipe. The TIW Kelly Valve is located in the drill string below the kelly, the uppermost component of the drill string, and is designed to be closed under pressure to remove the kelly. 
Surface Equipment. Surface equipment is principally used for flow control on offshore production platforms, TLPs and Spars. Included in the Company’s surface equipment product line are platform wellheads, platform production trees and riser tensioners. Dril-Quip’s development of platform wellheads and platform production trees was facilitated by adaptation of its existing subsea wellhead and tree technology to surface wellheads and trees.
Platform wellheads are pressure-containing forged and machined metal housings in which casing hangers are landed and sealed at the platform deck to suspend casings. The Company emphasizes the use of metal-to-metal sealing wellhead systems with operational time-saving features which can be used in high pressure, high temperature and corrosive drilling and production applications.
After installation of a wellhead, a platform production tree, consisting of gate valves, a surface wellhead connector, controls, tree cap and associated equipment, is installed on the wellhead to control and regulate oil or gas production. Platform production trees are similar to subsea production trees but utilize less complex equipment and more manual, rather than 
8

hydraulically actuated, valves and connectors. Platform wellheads and platform production trees and associated equipment are designed and manufactured in accordance with customer specifications.
Riser tensioners are used on a floating drilling/production vessel to provide a continuous and reliable upward force on a riser string that is independent of the movement of the floating vessel.
Offshore Rig Equipment. Offshore rig equipment includes drilling riser systems, wellhead connectors and diverters. The drilling riser system consists of (i) lengths of riser pipe and associated riser connectors that secure one to another; (ii) the telescopic joint, which connects the entire drilling riser system to the diverter at top of the riser at the rig and provides a means to compensate for vertical motion of the rig relative to the ocean floor; and (iii) the wellhead connector, which provides a means for remote connection and disconnection of the blowout preventer stack to or from the wellhead. Diverters are used to provide protection from shallow gas blowouts and to divert gases off of the rig during the drilling operation.
Wellhead connectors are used on production riser systems and drilling riser systems. They are also used on both TLPs and Spars, which are installed in deepwater applications. The principal markets for offshore rig equipment are new rigs, rig upgrades, TLPs and Spars. Drilling risers, wellhead connectors and diverters are generally designed and manufactured to customer specifications.
Certain of the Company's products are used in potentially hazardous drilling, completion and production applications that can cause personal injury, product liability and environmental claims. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business involves numerous operating hazards that may not be covered by insurance. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.”
Services
The Company provides services to customers, including technical advisory assistance as well as rework and reconditioning services on its customer-owned products. These services are provided from the Company’s worldwide locations and represented approximately 19% of revenues in 2018 compared to 14% in 2017 and 12% in 2016.
Technical Advisory Assistance. Dril-Quip generally does not install products for its customers, but it does provide technical advisory assistance to the customer, if requested, in the installation of its products. The customer is not obligated to utilize these services and may use its own personnel or a third party to perform these services. Technical advisory assistance services performed by the Company are negotiated and sold separately from the Company’s products. These services are not a prerequisite to the sale of the Company’s products as its products are fully functional on a stand alone basis. The Company’s technicians provide assistance in the onsite installation of the Company’s products and are available on a 24-hour call out from the Company’s facilities located in Houston, Texas; Midland, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Youngsville, Louisiana; Villahermosa, Mexico; Anaco, Venezuela; Shushufindi, Ecuador; Macae, Brazil; Aberdeen, Scotland; Szolnok, Hungary; Stavanger, Norway; Esbjerg, Denmark; Port Harcourt, Nigeria; Alexandria, Egypt; Takoradi, Ghana; Tianjin, China; Doha, Qatar; Singapore; and Perth, Australia.
Reconditioning. The Company provides reconditioning of its customer-owned products at its facilities in Houston, Texas; Macae, Brazil; Aberdeen, Scotland; Stavanger, Norway; Esbjerg, Denmark; Port Harcourt, Nigeria; Alexandria, Egypt; Takoradi, Ghana; Balikpapan, Indonesia; Tianjin, China; Doha, Qatar; Singapore; and Perth, Australia. The Company does not typically service, repair or recondition its competitors’ products.
Leasing
The Company rents running and installation tools for use in installing its products. These tools are required to install and retrieve the Company’s products that are purchased by customers. Rental or purchase of running tools is not a condition of the sale of the Company’s products and is contracted for separately from product sales and other services offered by the Company. Running tools are available from Dril-Quip’s locations in Houston, Texas; Midland, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Youngsville, Louisiana; Villahermosa, Mexico; Anaco, Venezuela; Shushufindi, Ecuador; Macae, Brazil; Aberdeen, Scotland; Szolnok, Hungary; Stavanger, Norway; Esbjerg, Denmark; Beverwijk, Holland; Singapore; and Perth, Australia. These rentals are provided from the Company's worldwide locations and represented approximately 12% of revenues in 2018 compared to 9% in 2017 and 8% in 2016.

Manufacturing
Dril-Quip has major manufacturing facilities in Houston, Texas; Aberdeen, Scotland; Singapore; and Macae, Brazil. See “Item 2. Properties—Manufacturing Facilities.” Dril-Quip maintains its high standards of product quality through the implementation of Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP) methodologies, as well as through the use of quality control specialists.
The Company’s Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore and Macae manufacturing plants are ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and ISO 9001 certified. The Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore and Macae plants are also licensed to applicable American Petroleum Institute (API) product specifications and are API Q1, 9th edition and APIQ2 compliant. The Metallurgical Laboratory at the Houston operations is ISO 17025 certified for Crack Tip Opening Displacement, Hardness, Tensile and Charpy V-Notch testing. Dril-Quip works to maintain its high standards of product quality through the use of precision measuring equipment such as Gage Masters, Faro Arms, Coordinate Measuring Machine and the application of APQP. APQP entails concurrent engineering principles to identify and address potential quality concerns early in the product development process. The Company has the capability to manufacture its products globally and continues to have local capability in key critical markets.
The Company’s primary raw material is cast steel ingots, from which it produces steel shaped forgings at its forging and heat treatment facility in Houston, Texas. The Company routinely purchases steel ingots from multiple suppliers on a purchase order basis and does not have any long-term supply contracts. The Company’s Houston facility has the capability to provide forgings and heat treatment for its Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore and Macae facilities. Prolonged periods of low demand in the market for drilling and production equipment could have a greater effect on the Company than on certain of its competitors that have not made such large capital investments in their facilities.
Dril-Quip’s manufacturing facilities utilize state-of-the-art computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools and equipment, which contribute to the Company’s product quality and timely delivery. The Company has also developed a cost effective, in-house machine tool rebuild and refurbishment capability, which produces machine upgrades with customized features to enhance the economic manufacturing of its specialized products. This strategy provides the added advantage of in-house expertise for repairs and maintenance of these machines. 
Customers
The Company’s principal customers are major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies. Drilling contractors and engineering and construction companies also represent a portion of the Company’s customer base. The Company’s customers are generally oil and gas companies that are well-known participants in exploration and production.
The Company is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers. In 2018, the Company’s top 15 customers represented approximately 56% of total revenues, and BP and its affiliated companies accounted for approximately 13% of total revenues. In 2017 and 2016, the Company’s top 15 customers represented approximately 49% and 75% of total revenues, respectively, and Chevron and its affiliated companies accounted for approximately 14% and 16% of total revenues, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in 2018, 2017 or 2016. The number and variety of the Company’s products required in a given year by any one customer depends upon the amount of that customer’s capital expenditure budget devoted to exploration and production and on the results of competitive bids for major projects. Consequently, a customer that accounts for a significant portion of revenues in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenues in subsequent years. While the Company is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers, the loss of one or more of its significant customers could, at least on a short-term basis, have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.
Backlog
Backlog consists of firm customer orders of Dril-Quip products for which a purchase order, signed contract or letter of award has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled. Historically, the Company’s revenues for a specific period have not been directly related to its backlog as stated at a particular point in time. The Company’s product backlog was approximately $270.0 million and $207.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The backlog at the end of 2018 represents an increase of approximately $62.7 million, or 30%, from the end of 2017. The Company’s backlog balance during 2018 was negatively impacted by translation adjustments of approximately $3.1 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar, and approximately $11.7 million in cancellations.
During the first quarter of 2018, Dril-Quip Asia-Pacific Pte Ltd. was awarded a contract to supply top-tensioned riser (TTR) systems and related services for the development of the Ca Rong Do Project (CRD Project) located offshore Vietnam operated by Repsol with the participation of Mubadala, PVEP and PetroVietnam.  The CRD Project is included within the backlog balance presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements; however, due to ongoing territorial discussions between China and Vietnam, the CRD Project may experience continued delays or cancellation. 
10

The Company expects to fill approximately 70% to 80% of the December 31, 2018 product backlog by December 31, 2019. The remaining backlog at December 31, 2018 consists of longer-term projects which are being designed and manufactured to customer specifications requiring longer lead times. In August 2012, the Company’s Brazilian subsidiary, Dril-Quip do Brasil LTDA, was awarded a four-year contract by Petrobras, Brazil’s national oil company. The contract was valued at $650.0 million, net of Brazilian taxes, at exchange rates in effect at that time (approximately $342.2 million based on the December 31, 2018 exchange rate of 3.8748 Brazilian real to 1.00 U.S. dollar) if all the equipment under the contract was ordered. Amounts are included in the Company's backlog as purchase orders or letters of award are received. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s backlog included $9.3 million of purchase orders under this Petrobras contract. As part of an amendment to extend the term of the contract, Petrobras agreed to issue purchase orders totaling a minimum of approximately $25.3 million (based on current exchange rates) before 2019. As of December 31, 2018, Petrobras has issued a total of three purchase orders (one during each year of 2016, 2017 and 2018) totaling the committed amount. The Company cannot provide assurance that Petrobras will order all of the equipment under the contract. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future revenues and earnings.”
Marketing and Sales
Dril-Quip markets its products and services throughout the world directly through its sales personnel in multiple domestic and international locations. In addition, in certain foreign markets the Company utilizes independent sales agents or representatives to enhance its marketing and sales efforts.
Some of the locations in which Dril-Quip has sales agents or representatives are Trinidad, Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Although they do not have authority to contractually bind the Company, these representatives market the Company’s products in their respective territories in return for sales commissions. The Company advertises its products and services in trade and technical publications targeted to its customer base. The Company also participates in industry conferences and trade shows to enhance industry awareness of its products.
The Company’s customers generally order products on a purchase order basis. Orders, other than those considered to be long-term projects, are typically filled within twelve months after receipt, depending on the type of product and whether it is sold out of inventory or requires some customization. Contracts for certain of the Company’s larger, more complex products, such as subsea production trees, drilling risers and equipment for TLPs and Spars, can take a year or more to complete.
The primary factors influencing a customer’s decision to purchase the Company’s products are the quality, reliability and reputation of the product, price, technology, service and timely delivery. For large drilling and production system orders, project management teams coordinate customer needs with the Company’s engineering, manufacturing and service organizations, as well as with subcontractors and vendors.
A portion of the Company’s business consists of designing, manufacturing and selling equipment, as well as offering technical advisory assistance during installation of the equipment, for major projects pursuant to competitive bids. The number of such projects in any year may fluctuate. The Company’s profitability on such projects is critically dependent on making accurate and cost effective bids and performing efficiently in accordance with bid specifications. Various factors, including availability of raw materials, changes in customer requirements and governmental regulations, can adversely affect the Company’s performance on individual projects, with potential material adverse effects on project profitability.
Product Development and Engineering
The technological demands of the oil and gas industry continue to increase as exploration and drilling expand into more hostile environments. Conditions encountered in these environments include water depths in excess of 10,000 feet, well pressures exceeding 15,000 psi, well flowing temperatures beyond 350oF (Fahrenheit) and mixed flows of oil, gas and water that may also be highly corrosive and impact material properties.
Since its founding in 1981, Dril-Quip has actively engaged in continuing development efforts to generate new products and improve existing products. When developing new products, the Company typically seeks to design the most technologically advanced version for a particular application to establish its reputation and qualification in that product. Thereafter, the Company leverages its expertise in the more technologically advanced product to produce less costly and complex versions of the product for less demanding applications. The Company also focuses its activities on reducing the overall cost to the customer, which includes not only the initial capital cost but also operating, installation and maintenance costs associated with its products.
In the 1980s, the Company introduced its first product, specialty connectors, as well as mudline suspension systems, template systems and subsea wellheads. In the 1990s, the Company introduced a series of new products, including diverters, wellhead connectors, SingleBore™ subsea trees, improved severe service dual bore subsea trees, subsea and platform valves, platform wellheads, platform trees, subsea tree workover riser systems, drilling riser systems and TLP and Spar production riser systems. Since 2000, Dril-Quip has introduced multiple new products, including liner hangers, subsea control systems, subsea 
11

manifolds, riser tensioners, and enhanced versions of subsea wellhead connectors and Dril-Quip’s industry leading subsea wellhead system(s).
Historically, Dril-Quip’s product development work is primarily conducted at its facilities in Houston, Texas; however, such activities have gradually increased in other regions, such as Aberdeen, Scotland, Singapore and Brazil. In addition to the work of its product development staff, the Company’s application engineering staff provides technical services to customers in connection with the design and sales of its products. The Company’s ability to develop new products and maintain technological advantages is important to its future success. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our business could be adversely affected if we do not develop new products and secure and retain patents related to our products.”
The Company believes that the success of its business depends more on the technical competence, creativity and marketing abilities of its employees than on any individual patent, trademark or copyright. Nevertheless, as part of its ongoing product development and manufacturing activities, Dril-Quip’s policy has been to seek patents when appropriate on inventions concerning new products and product improvements. All patent rights for products developed by employees are assigned to the Company and almost all of the Company’s products have components that are covered by patents.
In 2018, major production milestones were met for several key global projects. In the North Sea, the last of an initial 18 subsea completion trees for a subsea field development project was successfully installed. Following the success of the aforementioned project, Dril-Quip was awarded a front-end engineering and design contract for a subsea production system project located off the coast of South America. Additionally, subsea trees were delivered and installed for a field development project off the coast of Gabon. Also, off the coast of Trinidad, multiple deepwater subsea wellhead systems were installed with the support of a service facility in Trinidad, continuing Dril-Quip's aftermarket support presence in the region established the previous year. With the completion of engineering, manufacturing, assembly and testing of dry tree equipment, Dril-Quip was able to support the tieback of multiple wells for projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Engineering, manufacturing, assembly and test work continued on additional dry tree projects in the Company's backlog. The requirements of the equipment in these projects represent significant technological challenges, the development of which is serving to enhance the Company's overall engineering capabilities. 
Dril-Quip’s continued efforts in developing technologically advanced products enable Dril-Quip to offer products for the harshest environments. The latest subsea wellhead system has been accepted by a major oil company for its high pressure, high temperature applications, further strengthening Dril-Quip’s position in the subsea market. 
In an ongoing test program, the Company continued the utilization of its recently constructed high-load horizontal test machine and fatigue test machine for rigorous validation testing of its existing specialty connector product line. Active engineering programs have been initiated in-house to continue development in specialty connector product enhancements as well as new product development. This high-load horizontal test machine has been instrumental in the development and qualification of our latest 20,000 psi wellhead system and riser connector that utilize Dril-Quip proprietary locking and sealing profiles. Engineering development efforts are on-going in subsea production systems.
In early 2016, the Company announced that it is establishing a research and development facility in Singapore that focuses on materials and products suitable for HPHT applications. The new facility serves as an additional hub for research and development activities for the Company.
Dril-Quip has numerous U.S. registered trademarks, including Dril-Quip®, Quik-Thread®, Quik-Stab®, Multi-Thread®, MS-15®, SS-15®, SS-10®, SU-90®, DX® and TIW®. The Company has registered its trademarks in the countries where such registration is deemed material.
Although in the aggregate, the Company’s patents and trademarks are of considerable importance to the manufacturing and marketing of many of its products, the Company does not consider any single patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks to be material to its business as a whole, except the Dril-Quip® trademark. The Company also relies on trade secret protection for its confidential and proprietary information. The Company routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and suppliers. There can be no assurance, however, that others will not independently obtain similar information or otherwise gain access to the Company’s trade secrets.
Competition
Dril-Quip faces significant competition from other manufacturers and suppliers of exploration and production equipment. Several of its primary competitors are diversified multinational companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than those of the Company and which, in many instances, have been engaged in the manufacturing business for a much longer period of time than the Company. The Company competes principally with the petroleum production equipment segments of Baker Hughes, a GE Company; Schlumberger, Ltd.; TechnipFMC plc; and Aker Solutions.
Because of their relative size and diversity of products, several of the Company’s competitors have the ability to provide “turnkey” services for drilling and production applications, which enables them to use their own products to the exclusion of 
12

Dril-Quip’s products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—We may be unable to successfully compete with other manufacturers of drilling and production equipment.” The Company also competes to a lesser extent with a number of other companies in various products. The principal competitive factors in the petroleum drilling and production equipment markets are quality, reliability and reputation of the product, price, technology, service and timely delivery.
Employees
The total number of the Company's employees as of December 31, 2017 was 2,019. Of those 2,019 employees, 1,095 were located in the United States. As a result of worldwide reductions in workforce and natural attrition, the total number of the Company's employees as of December 31, 2018 was 1,926, a 5% reduction from December 31, 2017. Of those 1,926 employees, 946 were located in the United States. As a result of the Company's ongoing efforts to control costs, we expect to reduce approximately 15% of our workforce in 2019, resulting in $7.3 million in severance costs being recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018. Substantially all of the Company's employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, and the Company considers its employee relations to be good.
The Company’s operations depend in part on its ability to attract quality employees. While the Company believes that its wage and salary rates are competitive and that its relationship with its labor force is good, a significant increase in the wages and salaries paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of the Company’s labor force, increases in the wage and salary rates paid by the Company or both. If either of these events were to occur, in the near-term, the profits realized by the Company from work in progress would be reduced and, in the long-term, the production capacity and profitability of the Company could be diminished and the growth potential of the Company could be impaired. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Loss of our key management or other personnel could adversely impact our business.”
Governmental Regulations
Many aspects of the Company’s operations are affected by political developments and are subject to both domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including those relating to oilfield operations, the discharge of materials into the environment from our manufacturing or other facilities, health and worker safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection. In addition, the Company depends on the demand for its services from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, is affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry in general, including those specifically directed to onshore and offshore operations. The adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for economic or other policy reasons could adversely affect the Company’s operations by limiting demand for the Company’s products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our operations and our customers’ operations are subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.”
In recent years, increased concern has been raised over the protection of the environment. Legislation to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases has been introduced, but not enacted, in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the annual United Nations Climate Change Conferences. In November 2015, the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) was held in Paris with the objective to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 20 C (Celsius), from all nations, regardless of size. The Paris Agreement, signed by the U.S. on April 22, 2016, requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, every five years. However, in August 2017, the United States informed the United Nations of its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The earliest possible effective withdrawal date from the Paris Agreement is November 2020. Also, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has undertaken efforts to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions and their effects. Following a finding by the EPA that certain greenhouse gases represent a danger to human health, the EPA expanded its regulations relating to those emissions and adopted rules imposing permitting and reporting obligations. The results of the permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of these greenhouse gases by the EPA. Moreover, specific design and operational standards apply to U.S. outer continental shelf vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles, structures and equipment. 
The U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) regulates the design and operation of well control and other equipment at offshore production sites, among other requirements. BSEE has adopted stricter requirements for subsea drilling production equipment. In April 2016, BSEE published a final blowout preventer systems and well control rule, which focuses on blowout preventer requirements and includes reforms in well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring and subsea containment, among other things. BSEE also finalized a rule in September 2016 concerning production safety systems for oil and natural gas operations on the Outer Continental Shelf. However, in December 2017, BSEE published a proposed rule that would revise a number of the requirements in the September 2016 rule. The final rule implementing these revisions was published in September 2018. In addition, in May 2018, BSEE published a proposed rule that would revise 
13

several requirements of the blowout preventer systems and well control rule. A final rule has not yet been issued. In addition, drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. For example, in December 2016, the Obama administration banned offshore drilling in portions of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. Although the Trump administration announced a proposal in January 2018 to open most U.S. coastal waters to offshore drilling, several coastal states have taken steps to prohibit offshore drilling. For example, California passed laws in September 2018 barring the construction of new oil drilling-related infrastructure in state waters. Similarly, in November 2018, voters in Florida approved an amendment to the state constitution that would ban oil and gas drilling in offshore state waters. Further, in December 2018, environmental groups challenged incidental harassment authorizations issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service that allow companies to conduct air gun seismic surveys for oil and gas exploration off the Atlantic coast. The attorneys general for nine coastal states also sought to intervene as plaintiffs. To the extent that new laws or other governmental actions prohibit or restrict drilling or impose additional environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general and the drilling industry in particular, the business of the Company could be adversely affected. Similarly, restrictions on authorizations needed to conduct seismic surveys could impact our customers' ability to identify oil and gas reserves, thereby reducing demand for our products. The Company cannot determine to what extent its future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.”
Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations related to workplace safety and worker health, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Based on the Company’s experience to date, the Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its business or consolidated financial position as a result of future compliance with existing environmental, health and safety laws. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of or by regulatory agencies, or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures by the Company, which may be material.
