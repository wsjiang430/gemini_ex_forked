OVERVIEW

We are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products that have the potential to optimize the delivery of infused therapies, advance patient care and reduce healthcare costs. Our strategy is designed to enable the subcutaneous administration of therapies that have previously been limited to intravenous, or IV, delivery. By moving delivery away from the high-cost healthcare settings typically required for IV administration, we believe our technology has the potential to reduce overall healthcare costs and advance the quality and convenience of care. Our approved product, FUROSCIX, consists of our novel formulation of furosemide delivered via West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.'s, or West’s, on-body infusor, which delivers an 80 mg dose. On October 10, 2022, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved FUROSCIX for the treatment of congestion due to fluid overload in adults with New York Heart Association, or NYHA, Class II/III chronic heart failure. FUROSCIX is the first and only FDA-approved subcutaneous loop diuretic that delivers IV equivalent diuresis at home. IV equivalence was established in a clinical study in which FUROSCIX demonstrated 99.6% bioavailability (90% CI: 94.8%-104.8%) and 8-hour urine output of 2.7 L which was similar to subjects receiving intravenous furosemide. We estimate that there is a $6.9 billion total market opportunity for FUROSCIX in the United States. The commercial launch of FUROSCIX commenced in the first quarter of 2023.
 
Heart failure affects 7.2 million adults in the United States who collectively experience approximately 4 million heart failure events annually. An estimated 59% of hospital admissions for heart failure are directly attributable to volume overload. Approximately 80% of heart failure patients discharged from hospital schedule a follow-up appointment and 25-30% of patients are readmitted to hospital post-discharge within 30 days. Repeat hospitalization for heart failure has been associated with increased mortality, with first-time discharges having a median survival (50% mortality) of 2.4 years, decreasing to 0.6 years following a fourth hospitalization. Our proprietary formulation of furosemide administered subcutaneously via an on-body infusor, which we refer to together as FUROSCIX, is intended to help alleviate the signs and symptoms associated with congestion due to fluid retention in patients with NYHA Class II/III chronic heart failure, such as fatigue and shortness of breath. FUROSCIX is designed to offer alternative outpatient intervention for heart failure patients who display reduced responsiveness to oral diuretics in non-emergency situations and do not require hospitalization.
 
We believe FUROSCIX will allow heart failure patients to receive IV-strength diuresis outside the high-cost hospital setting. At a price of $822 per dose, we estimate the average cost of treatment with FUROSCIX for each heart failure exacerbation (comprising four doses of FUROSCIX) to be approximately $3,300. Prevention of hospital admission and reduced readmission rates would result in reducing the estimated 15 million days patients with heart failure spend in the hospital each year. By decreasing the number of admissions and readmissions to hospitals, we believe we can drive significant cost savings to payers and hospitals.
 
We are leveraging our subcutaneous formulation expertise to potentially develop additional product candidates that we believe can significantly decrease the cost of treatment by moving treatment away from the hospital setting and can improve patient quality of life by eliminating the need for IV catheters. In this area, we have conducted additional development work to develop a proprietary, subcutaneously administered formulation of ceftriaxone, a parenteral cephalosporin that is typically administered intravenously or intramuscularly. Based on IMS Health data, each year in the United States, there are 15 million outpatient days of ceftriaxone therapy to treat various types of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and Lyme Disease. The current outpatient treatment option for these patients, Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy requires the placement of a long-term venous access device, known as a peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC, and coordination of home infusion or office-based infusion services for patients to receive antibiotics outside of the hospital, which places significant burdens on the patients. We believe subcutaneous administration of ceftriaxone represents an opportunity to reduce costs to the overall health care system and improve the quality of care by reducing the complications and serious health risks associated with IV catheters and increasing patient mobility and convenience. We have conducted a pharmacokinetic study with subcutaneous ceftriaxone and intend to conduct additional clinical trials to advance its development.

Beyond furosemide and ceftriaxone, we aim to leverage our subcutaneous formulation expertise to develop and seek approval of additional product candidates.

OUR PLATFORM AND OTHER PIPELINE PROGRAMS

FUROSCIX to Treat Congestion in Patients with Heart Failure
 Heart failure is a chronic disease resulting from impairment of the heart’s ability to pump blood and is one of the most common causes of hospital admissions in patients over 65 with at least 1-2 million hospitalizations in the United States annually. Patients with heart failure are prone to retaining sodium and water in their blood stream and, as this accumulates, it can distribute to tissues. This extra fluid settling in the lungs, ankles and abdomen can cause symptoms ranging from weight gain, mild swelling and shortness of breath while walking to more severe symptoms, such as weakness, severe fatigue and difficulty breathing when sitting or lying down. Congestion is the most common cause of hospitalization for patients with heart failure.
 Oral loop diuretics, such as furosemide, are the mainstay for the management and prevention of congestion in patients with heart failure. However, during periods of worsening congestion in heart failure, the bioavailability of oral furosemide is reduced and becomes highly variable. To overcome the limitation of oral furosemide in this setting, two strategies are typically employed. First, the furosemide dose is typically doubled, and/or additional oral diuretics (thiazide diuretics) are incorporated to attempt to overcome the blunted pharmacological response to these agents. Second, if this fails, clinicians often rely on giving IV diuretics, either in the hospital, an outpatient heart failure clinic or an infusion center, if available. Approximately 800,000 patients with symptoms of heart failure are admitted to the hospital by an emergency physician annually and we believe 50% of these admissions may be potentially avoided if patients could receive timely, effective treatment for symptomatic congestion outside of the hospital setting.

In addition to potentially unnecessary hospitalizations, it has been estimated that up to 50% of patients hospitalized for an episode of acute decompensated heart failure are discharged on oral diuretics with persistent signs and symptoms of congestion. The presence of congestion at discharge has been associated with an increased risk of 30-day all-cause mortality and rehospitalization for heart failure. The American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association Task Force on Practice guidelines recommend that patients hospitalized for heart failure have a post discharge follow up visit within 14 days of hospital discharge. Since symptoms of congestion generally worsen over several days or weeks, patients with heart failure may receive FUROSCIX at discharge when congestion has not fully resolved or at the first signs of worsening congestion post hospitalization.
 
FUROSCIX therefore offers an alternative outpatient route of administration of furosemide for NYHA Class II/III chronic heart failure patients to alleviate the signs and symptoms associated with congestion when responsiveness to oral diuretics is reduced and hospitalization is not indicated in order to potentially avoid unnecessary hospitalizations.
FUROSCIX is our novel formulation of furosemide contained in a pre-filled, Crystal Zenith® cartridge and self- administered subcutaneously via a single-use, disposable and wearable on-body delivery system. The user inserts the pre-filled cartridge into the wearable device, secures it to the abdomen via a medical-grade adhesive, and a subcutaneous infusion of FUROSCIX is administered through a pre-programmed, biphasic delivery profile with 30 mg administered over the first hour, followed by 12.5 mg per hour for the subsequent 4 hours (a total dose of 80 mg (10 mL) over 5 hours).

We believe that FUROSCIX provides a safe and effective solution that will enable IV-strength diuresis outside of the high-cost hospital setting. We believe FUROSCIX can potentially reduce the estimated 15 million days per year that heart failure patients spend in the hospital and thus reduce overall health care costs by decreasing both admissions and readmissions.

We believe subcutaneous FUROSCIX has the potential to:

•Reduce hospital admission rates: Since symptoms of congestion generally worsen over several days or weeks, there is a window of opportunity to intervene. We believe FUROSCIX could in certain instances avoid a hospitalization by providing IV-strength diuresis in an outpatient setting such as the physician’s office, a heart failure clinic or at home. It is estimated that 90% of patients presenting to the emergency department with worsening heart failure are admitted to the hospital and approximately 50% of those patients could potentially be safely discharged after demonstrating effective diuresis with parenteral therapy during a brief period of observation. 


•Reduce patient readmission: We believe FUROSCIX could reduce the incidence of readmission for heart failure patients by providing IV-strength diuresis in the home post-hospital discharge. It is estimated that 30-50% of patients that are hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure that are transitioned to oral furosemide prior to being discharged from the hospital have persistent symptoms of congestion at discharge. Persistent congestion may reduce the absorption of oral furosemide reducing the diuretic effect. As a result, patients are often readmitted to the hospital to receive IV furosemide. We believe FUROSCIX can break this cycle by providing IV-strength diuresis to patients shortly after discharge to reduce the rate of readmissions for decompensated heart failure. 
 
FUROSCIX offers an outpatient therapeutic option to deliver IV-strength furosemide to potentially avoid the need for unnecessary, expensive hospitalizations which in turn could improve patients’ quality of life with minimal interruption of daily living.

Clinical Development of FUROSCIX

On October 10, 2022, we announced that the FDA approved FUROSCIX for the treatment of congestion due to fluid overload in adults with New York Heart Association Class II/III chronic heart failure. FUROSCIX is not indicated for emergency situations or in patients with acute pulmonary edema. FUROSCIX is a drug-device combination product and was approved pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, in reliance on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for the Listed Drug Furosemide (Injection, USP, 10 mg/mL; NDA 18667; Hospira, Inc.), which is indicated for intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) injection for the treatment of edema in adult patients with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver and renal disease, including nephrotic syndrome. FUROSCIX is the first and only FDA-approved subcutaneous loop diuretic that delivers IV equivalent diuresis at home.
 
FUROSCIX (Furosemide Injection, 80 mg/10 mL) is a novel, pH neutral formulation of furosemide that is administered via a subcutaneous infusion using a proprietary, wearable, pre-programmed on-body drug delivery system. Other currently available furosemide injection products are alkaline, with a pH of 8.0 – 9.3. Subcutaneous administration of IV/IM furosemide, USP formulation has been associated with local skin reactions, some severe, requiring discontinuation of treatment and local treatment of the complication which has been attributed to the alkaline pH of the furosemide formulation, volume of fluid administered and the rapid injection.
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Study
We conducted a pivotal, randomized, open-label crossover study from April to September 2015 to assess the relative bioavailability of FUROSCIX in 17 patients with heart failure. In this study, FUROSCIX was delivered subcutaneously via the B. Braun Perfusor Space Infusion Pump. This study also evaluated diuresis and the urinary sodium excretion over eight hours and 24 hours post-dosing as the pharmacodynamic endpoints.
Treatment arms
In this study, the reference treatment was IV furosemide with two bolus injections of 40 mg dosed over two minutes, two hours apart. Our test treatment was FUROSCIX with 80 mg infused subcutaneously, with 30 mg over the first hour followed by 12.5 mg per hour over the subsequent four hours. 
Comparative pharmacokinetic results
This study demonstrated bioequivalence in the concentration of drug delivered over time based upon the area under the curve, or AUC, between our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide and IV furosemide. Although the maximum concentration, or Cmax, of furosemide achieved was four-fold higher with IV injection compared to subcutaneous infusion, the bioavailability of subcutaneous infusion relative to intravenous injection was 99.6%, with a 90% confidence interval of 94.8% to 104.8%, thus meeting the FDA’s defined bioequivalence criteria limit of 80% to 125%. We believe that the observed difference in Cmax between IV injection and subcutaneous furosemide is attributable to the two bolus IV injections administered at the initiation of IV therapy. Nevertheless, the 5-hour infusion of FUROSCIX resulted in nearly complete bioavailability compared to two bolus IV injections of furosemide.
Comparative pharmacodynamic results

Total mean urine outputs for subcutaneous versus IV administration were 102% (2654 mL vs 2641 mL; p = 0.83) and 103% (3630 mL vs 3538 mL; p = 0.71) at 8 and 24 hours, respectively. Total mean urine sodium excretion for subcutaneous versus IV administration were 97.3% (284 mmol vs 292 mmol; p = 0.78) and 97.4% (341 mmol vs 350 mmol; p = 0.80), at 8 and 24 hours, respectively. The total urine sodium excretion and urine output were comparable between our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide and IV furosemide.
Human Factors Summary
We conducted a human factors validation study for the West on-body infusor from October 21, 2019 to November 14, 2019. The study included 60 subjects made up of 30 heart failure patients, 15 caregivers and 15 healthcare practitioners. Half of the patients were trained, while the remaining patients, all caregivers and all HCPs were untrained.
Participants performed extremely well across all user groups and training conditions. All participants but one successfully setup and started the infusion without experiencing any use errors related to critical tasks which would delay dosing or harm the patient.
 
All participants successfully noticed, identified, and articulated how to respond to an alarm experienced during an infusion without any use errors.

All participants successfully allowed the infusion to carry out, noticed when it completed and performed all steps required to remove and dispose of the on-body infusor without any use errors.

Overall, the study, which was designed to measure eight observational use metrics, across 900 tasks including setup, starting of the infusion, responding to the on-body infusor alarm and finishing the procedure after the infusion demonstrated a user success rate of 99%.
 
Participants also performed well during the knowledge and reading comprehension tasks. Thirty-seven knowledge and comprehension tasks related to critical information were evaluated. Overall, across all 2,220 knowledge and comprehension tasks, participants experienced a user success rate of over 99.5%.
FREEDOM-HF - Furoscix Real-World Evaluation for Decreasing Hospital Admissions in Heart Failure

FREEDOM-HF was a health economic study designed to support the commercial reimbursement of FUROSCIX. Further, this multicenter, prospective adaptive clinical trial was designed to evaluate differences in heart failure and overall costs between subjects receiving FUROSCIX outside the hospital and patients receiving intravenous furosemide in the hospital setting for 30-days after being discharged from the emergency department. Differences in costs were determined from a propensity-matched control arm derived from Truven Health Analytics Market Scan databases. The study was designed to enroll up to 75 subjects in the FUROSCIX cohort to detect a statistically significant difference in 30-day overall and heart-failure related costs. The study began enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2020 and completed enrollment in May 2021.

Based on the results from a planned, prespecified interim analysis conducted to confirm the final sample size, and following input from statisticians, principal investigators, payer advisors and Health Economics and Outcomes Research experts, enrollment was closed on May 17, 2021, prior to the enrollment target of 34 patients. This decision was made due to the statistically significant reduction observed in 30-day heart failure-related costs in patients who received FUROSCIX in the interim analysis. The final analysis included 24 subjects treated with FUROSCIX and 66 matched comparators based on seven variables associated with hospitalization. On July 13, 2021, we announced preliminary top-line results from FREEDOM-HF, demonstrating that average 30-day heart failure-related costs were reduced by $17,753 per study subject in the FUROSCIX arm compared to historically matched comparators (p < 0.0001). In September 2021, we announced additional results from FREEDOM-HF, demonstrating that average 30-day total healthcare costs were reduced by $30,568 per study subject in the FUROSCIX arm compared to historically matched comparators (p < 0.0001). Since the price for FUROSCIX was not established at the time of study completion, the difference in costs did not include the cost of FUROSCIX. These results support our hypothesis that treating heart failure patients presenting to the emergency department with worsening congestion with FUROSCIX outside of the hospital setting has the potential to dramatically reduce the significant costs associated with hospital admissions and readmissions.



We conducted an analysis of additional secondary endpoints in FREEDOM-HF which provided additional insights into the clinical effectiveness of FUROSCIX. In this analysis, it was determined that patients who received FUROSCIX had a median reduction of heart failure peptide biomarkers from study entry to first visit, and to last visit, of 42.3% and 28%, respectively (p <0.01). In addition, patients who received FUROSCIX had a 12.8-point improvement in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12) Summary Score 30 days after study entry.
 
These results have been presented at the Heart Failure Society of America Annual meeting in September 2021 in Denver, Colorado and at the Technology and Heart Failure Therapeutics Conference in February 2022 in New York, NY.
 
AT HOME-HF PILOT - Avoiding Treatment in the Hospital with Furoscix for the Management of Congestion in Heart Failure – A Pilot Study
 AT-HOME-HF PILOT was a multicenter, randomized pilot clinical trial designed to evaluate the clinical outcomes and safety of FUROSCIX compared to a “treatment as usual” approach in patients presenting to a heart failure clinic with chronic heart failure and fluid overload requiring augmented diuretic therapy. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate prospective endpoints that could inform the design and sample size of a clinical trial that could be used to seek expansion of the indication for FUROSCIX to include a reduction of hospitalizations for heart failure or inclusion in treatment guidelines. The primary endpoint was a 30-day hierarchal composite of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalizations, emergency department visits for heart failure and % change of NT-proBNP at day seven from baseline, utilizing the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld win ratio. The Finkelstein-Schoenfeld win ratio is a statistical method used to compare composite outcomes for every pair in a clinical trial from the treatment and control group. Pre-defined secondary endpoints were evaluated from baseline across the 30-day study period and included the number of days alive and heart failure event free, global assessment via visual analog scale, composite clinical congestion score, 5- and 7-point Likert dyspnea scores, health-related quality of life measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, or KCCQ-12, serum creatinine, weight, six-minute walk test and ReDS® (Remote Dielectric Sensing) lung fluid measurement. The study compared FUROSCIX to a “treatment as usual” approach, was descriptive only and did not include a powered statistical hypothesis test. The study completed enrollment in the first quarter of 2022. The study enrolled 51 subjects, of which 34 received FUROSCIX and 17 received “treatment as usual”.
 
In July 2022, we announced top-line results from the AT HOME-HF Phase 2 Pilot study demonstrating a positive trend in the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld win ratio in the FUROSCIX group compared to the “treatment as usual” group across multiple analysis populations. Subjects randomized to FUROSCIX had a 37% reduction in the risk of a heart failure hospitalization relative to patients randomized to “treatment as usual” at day 30. All pre-defined secondary endpoints measuring symptoms of congestion, quality of life and functional status favored the FUROSCIX group and included a two kilogram greater weight loss at day three and a 12-point increase in the KCCQ-12 summary score at day 7 and day 30. There were 11 subjects that experienced 21 adverse events during the 30-day study period that were determined by the investigator to be related to FUROSCIX. The most common related adverse event was infusion site pain that was mild in severity. There was one serious adverse event (dehydration) that was assessed by the investigator as possibly related to FUROSCIX, which resolved. During the 30-day study period, there was one death (sudden cardiac death) in the FUROSCIX group which occurred on study day 30 and was assessed by the investigator to be not related to FUROSCIX.
 
In September 2022, we announced that subjects in the AT HOME-HF study who received FUROSCIX demonstrated augmented decongestion compared with patients receiving enhanced oral diuretics as demonstrated by:
 
•Improved diuresis as measured by a greater reduction in body weight from baseline at study day 3 (2.8 kg vs 0.8 kg, p=0.035);
 •Improvement from baseline in mean 5-point dyspnea score at day 3 (-0.5 vs. 0.1, p=0.019);
 •Greater number of patients with markedly or moderately better shortness of breath based on 7-point dyspnea at day 3 (44% vs 6%, p=0.006);


•Clinically relevant improvement from baseline in quality of life as measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire – 12 (KCCQ-12) summary score at study days 7 and 30 of 8.9 points and 9.3 points, respectively; and
 •An increase of 55.8 meters in the average six-minute walk distance at day 30 (36.7 vs -19.1 meters, p=.012).
 
The win-ratio for the hierarchical endpoint of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, urgent ED/clinic visit for heart failure and the percentage change in NT-proBNP from baseline at day seven was 1.11 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.48-2.50) favoring the FUROSCIX group.
 
During the 30-day study period, subjects in the FUROSCIX group spent an average of 23.2 days heart failure event free compared to 14.3 in subjects receiving enhanced oral diuretics.
 
In the FUROSCIX group, 14.7% of subjects had a serum potassium level that was less than 3.5 mEq/L during the 30-day study and was managed effectively with oral potassium supplements.
 
The results of the AT HOME-HF study showed that subjects receiving subcutaneous FUROSCIX demonstrated augmented decongestion, as evidenced by a greater reduction in body weight, better dyspnea scores, greater exercise capacity and improvement of health-related quality of life compared with patients receiving enhanced oral diuretics, or standard treatment, in a Phase 2 pilot study.
Commercialization
The commercial launch of FUROSCIX commenced in the first quarter of 2023. We plan to commercialize FUROSCIX in the United States by building and utilizing our own commercial infrastructure. We currently intend to focus our commercial efforts on the United States market, which we believe represents the largest market opportunity for FUROSCIX. In addition, we plan to seek collaborations with third-party partners outside of the United States to distribute our products in foreign markets, if approved by the relevant foreign regulatory authorities.
We believe that we can effectively commercialize FUROSCIX in the United States with an initial specialty sales force of approximately 40 field-based sales representatives. We intend to initially pursue a highly-concentrated target market, which consists of approximately 400 hospitals, associated clinics and office-based practices that, collectively account for approximately 40% of all IV furosemide administered to heart failure patients based on current IMS Drug Distribution Data. We also plan to target the top ten Medicare Part D plans, which cover 80% of Medicare Part D patients. We conducted payer research on 14 payers, representing 22 to 29 million total Medicare lives. We found that reducing readmissions and increasing patient comfort were ranked as important potential attributes of FUROSCIX by the health plans and pharmacy benefit managers that were surveyed.
We intend to build a highly concentrated commercial infrastructure focused on distribution, promotion and customer support to healthcare providers in our key hospital targets and in office-based practices. Our target call points within these hospitals and practices will include heart failure specialists, cardiologists, emergency room doctors and heart failure nurse practitioners. To date, our market research with 309 healthcare professionals has indicated that 93% of our target prescribers would adopt FUROSCIX, with 80% intending to adopt FUROSCIX in the first six months of product availability. Furthermore, within the prescriber group of heart failure specialists, cardiologists and nurse practitioners that we intend to target, the intent to adopt is 93%, 96% and 94%, respectively, and 89%, 88% and 86%, respectively, of those prescribers intend to adopt in the first six months of product availability. Based on our market research, healthcare professionals perceive the top potential advantages of FUROSCIX as the ability to treat in the home setting, prevention of hospitalization, and avoidance of IV placement, while the lowest perceived barriers to adoption identified in the survey were the preference to monitor in a hospital setting, sufficiency of current medications and hospital guidelines or protocols. In addition, based on a last two patient exercise conducted in our quantitative market research with healthcare professionals, when given the option to change their prior treatment choice to FUROSCIX, 65% of healthcare practitioners in a clinic setting and 40% in a hospital setting responded that they would prescribe our product candidate. We expect to supplement our outside sales force with inside sales representatives and people in the medical science, nursing and reimbursement fields to support the proper training and utilization of FUROSCIX.


As part of our commercialization strategy, we plan to educate hospitals, healthcare practitioners, patients and caregivers of the benefits of FUROSCIX and its proper use. We plan to work with national associations, such as the Heart Failure Society of America and the American Association of Heart Failure Nurses, hospital networks and individual hospitals to update treatment and issue guidelines to include subcutaneous furosemide outpatient treatment plans. These guidelines are intended to provide information to hospitals and healthcare practitioners regarding treatment of outpatient heart failure patients with subcutaneous furosemide.

Eligible patients with heart failure may receive FUROSCIX at the initial worsening signs and symptoms when the response to oral diuretics is not adequate. In addition, patients can receive FUROSCIX after discharge, if they still are exhibiting some signs and symptoms of congestion despite their oral diuretic regimen. FUROSCIX is packaged as individual, single use only on-body infusor kits. In April 2016, we held a meeting with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, at which CMS stated that coverage and reimbursement of FUROSCIX may be available under Medicare Part D as a transition of care drug.
By educating patients on the proper use of FUROSCIX shortly after discharge followed by a face-to-face visit, health care professionals can ensure proper training, initiate treatment at the point of care, and ensure that patients can receive additional days of treatment in the home setting.
 
Our Pipeline Programs

Beyond our initial focus on heart failure, our strategy is to identify and develop additional product candidates that we believe, if successfully developed and approved, could provide effective and convenient subcutaneous therapy that may benefit patients, caregivers and payers.
•scCeftriaxone: We have submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, for a subcutaneous form of Ceftriaxone, an antibiotic currently used intravenously for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. To date, we have completed a PK study for our Ceftriaxone formulation, which we refer to as scCeftriaxone. We are currently evaluating a suitable on-body delivery system to administer scCeftriaxone. 
 •scCarbapenem: We have completed several IND-enabling studies for our subcutaneous Carbapenem program, which we refer to as scCarbapenem, an antibiotic currently used intravenously for the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative organisms. 
 Ceftriaxone
Many patients with an infection requiring IV antibiotics are admitted to the hospital, and a portion of these patients will require subsequent outpatient treatment with IV administration requiring insertion of a PICC line catheter. Ceftriaxone is a parenteral antibiotic commonly used to treat various types of infections, including pneumonia, bone and joint infections, blood stream infections, urinary tract infections and Lyme Disease. According to 2015 data from Arlington Medical Resources, ceftriaxone is the second most utilized antibiotic in the hospital setting and second most utilized IV antibiotic at hospital discharge. Based on Option Care data from August 2016, ceftriaxone represents the largest segment of antibiotics prescribed in the outpatient setting, accounting for 19% of all outpatient prescriptions. Each year, there are approximately 15 million outpatient days of ceftriaxone therapy in the United States based on IMS Health data, with 50% of outpatient ceftriaxone administered to Medicare patients who do not have coverage for home infusion services and frequently must drive to a hospital clinic, emergency room or physician’s office or be admitted to a skilled nursing facility or hospital to receive IV antibiotics. Subcutaneous antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, have the potential to reduce the length of hospital stay by facilitating transition of care and eliminating the risks of complications from long term IV catheters. Such antibiotics could also enhance convenience and independence of patients and caregivers and potentially reduce the economic burden to payers, particularly in Medicare, by reducing payments for outpatient infusion services.


Under an IND we conducted a randomized, partially blinded crossover study of 18 patients to evaluate the PK and bioavailability of a commercial formulation of ceftriaxone administered subcutaneously as compared to IV administration. In this study, we observed that the bioavailability of subcutaneous ceftriaxone was 108% of that of IV ceftriaxone. In a PD model based on subcutaneous pharmacokinetics observed in this study, the T>MIC for the first 24 hours for the ceftriaxone 1-gram subcutaneous infusion was observed to be not inferior to the 1-gram IV infusion (98.5% vs 100%). The most common adverse event observed with subcutaneous ceftriaxone administration was pain, with a median pain score of two on a scale of zero to ten (with zero being no pain and ten being the worst possible pain). There were no serious adverse events reported in this study.
We intend to identify a suitable on-body delivery system for the administration of ceftriaxone subcutaneously, conduct additional studies to evaluate optimal delivery for ceftriaxone and to evaluate the skin safety of subcutaneous administration of ceftriaxone.
Additional Product Programs
We are leveraging our know-how for use in other clinical settings where subcutaneous delivery can improve IV treatments to develop a suite of product candidates that, like FUROSCIX, we believe can decrease the cost of treatment by moving treatment out of the hospital setting and eliminating the need for IV catheters. We expect to pursue the development of a subcutaneous carbapenem to treat infections caused by gram-negative infections and have completed initial feasibility work on a potential candidate. We also intend to identify other opportunities where subcutaneous delivery can improve patient treatment and reduce healthcare costs. We intend to evaluate market criteria to systematically choose potential product programs for our pipeline. We plan to look for product candidates that we believe allow us to clearly demonstrate value to patients and the healthcare system and that have large market potential and a concentrated specialty physician prescribing base. We expect to leverage our FUROSCIX sales force to promote additional products that we develop and commercialize.
Our FUROSCIX On-Body Infusor
The FUROSCIX On-Body Infusor is a drug-device combination product consisting of FUROSCIX (furosemide injection, 80 mg per 10 mL), a novel, pH neutral furosemide formulation optimized for subcutaneous administration and contained in a prefilled, Crystal Zenith® cartridge, and a proprietary wearable, pre-programmed on-body delivery system, the FUROSCIX On-Body Infusor, based on West's proprietary on-body infusor. The FUROSCIX On-Body Infusor is applied to the abdomen via a medical grade adhesive and delivers a subcutaneous infusion of FUROSCIX through a pre-programmed, biphasic delivery profile over 5 hours.

MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES

We use a network of qualified suppliers or contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce, manufacture, sterilize and assemble the component parts of FUROSCIX and our product candidates. Our suppliers produce these component parts to our designs and specifications. Certain processes utilized in the manufacture and test of our product candidates have been verified and validated as required by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. The manufacturing facilities of our suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and certain corresponding state agencies, and we regularly audit our suppliers’ processes in an effort to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our product candidates.

We believe that our current third-party manufacturers have capacity of FUROSCIX in quantities sufficient to meet our expected commercial needs and to accommodate the manufacturing of materials for future clinical trials of candidates in our pipeline.
In order to meet projected global demand for FUROSCIX, we plan to support an increase in production capacity at West’s and our pharmaceutical manufacturing partners' facilities.

Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also intend to rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us or our partners in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
Patent rights
Patent life determination depends on the date of filing of the application and other factors as promulgated under the patent laws. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country.

Furosemide formulations
As of February 8, 2023, we own a patent family directed to the composition of matter of our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide and methods of treating edema, hypertension or heart failure using the formulation of furosemide having a concentration of about 2 mg/mL to about 20 mg/mL. This patent family includes U.S. Patent Nos. 9,884,039 and 11,433,044, directed to methods of treatment, U.S. Patent No. 10,272,064, directed to liquid pharmaceutical formulations, one pending U.S. patent application, one granted patent in each of Canada, China and Europe, two granted patents in Japan, one pending patent application in Europe, and seven granted patents and five pending patent applications in other countries outside of the United States. Patents that issue from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2034, excluding any additional term in the United States for patent term adjustment. U.S. Patent Nos. 9,884,039; 10,272,064; and 11,433,044 are scheduled to expire in April 2034.
 
We also own a patent family directed to compositions of matter of liquid pharmaceutical formulations containing an increased concentration of furosemide and methods of treating congestion, edema, fluid overload, or hypertension using these formulations of furosemide. This patent family includes U.S. Patent Nos. 11,497,755; 11,559,535; and 11,571,434 directed to liquid pharmaceutical formulations, two pending U.S. patent applications, one pending patent application in each of Canada, China, Europe and Japan, and 12 pending patent applications in other countries outside of the United States. Patents that issue from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2040, excluding any additional term in the United States for patent term adjustment. U.S. Patent Nos. 11,497,755; 11,559,535; and 11,571,434 are scheduled to expire in January 2040.
 Trade secret and other protection
In addition to patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our technology and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. The agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements generally also provide that we shall own all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us.
Other intellectual property rights
 We file trademark applications and pursue registrations in the United States and abroad when appropriate. We own trademark registrations in the U.S. and E.U. for the marks SCPHARMACEUTICALS and FUROSCIX.
From time to time, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third-party intellectual property holders.

COMPETITION
Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition and potential competition from a number of sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic drug companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. Some of these companies are developing therapies that are directly competitive to our approach, and others are more generally developing therapies to treat heart failure. These companies include but are not limited to: Abbott Laboratories, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Bioheart, Boston Scientific, Boehringer Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly and Company, Merck & Co., Medtronic, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi, Sarfez Pharmaceuticals, Servier Pharmaceuticals, SQ Innovation and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates include ease of administration and convenience of dosing, therapeutic efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles and cost. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as more experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other foreign regulatory approvals of products, and the commercialization of those products. Consequently, our competitors may develop similar products for the treatment of heart failure or for other indications we may pursue in the future, and such competitors’ products may be more effective, better tolerated and less costly than our product candidates. Our competitors may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products than we are. We will also face competition in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.

U.S. drug development process

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs, medical devices and drug-device combination products under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice regulations, or GLPs, and other applicable regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice regulations, or GCPs, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use; 
 •submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, after completion of all pivotal trials; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of potential inspection of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
 

Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. An IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the trial includes an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about on-going or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted.

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and a separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 
Furthermore, an independent IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries, including clinicaltrials.gov.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage. 
 •Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMPs. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. review and approval process

The results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission, or ten months from the date of receipt for a drug that is not a new molecular entity.

The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
 
After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or

withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products.

In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the
required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 
Regulation of Combination Products in the United States

Certain products may be comprised of components, such as drug components and device components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:
•a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; 
 •two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; 
 •a drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or 
 •any investigational drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect. 
 
Under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for combination products, although it does not preclude consultations by the lead center with other components of the FDA. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination

product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.

A combination product with a drug primary mode of action generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the drug approval processes under the FDCA. In reviewing the NDA or 505(b)(2) application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the drug center could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA regulations, combination products are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both drugs and devices, including the Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, applicable to medical devices.

Orphan drug designation

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. However, competitors, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of a competing product for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the “same drug,” as defined by the FDA, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same disease or condition. In addition, if an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity.

Expedited development and review programs

The FDA has a number of programs intended to expedite the development or review of a marketing application for a new drug. For example, the fast track designation program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for developing and reviewing product candidates that meet certain criteria. Specifically, investigational drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. With regard to a fast track product candidate, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive

FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation or breakthrough designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or efficacy compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals. For non-new molecular entity NDAs, these six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the date that the FDA receives the application.

In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical trials. Drugs receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory trials in a timely manner or if such trials fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition of accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.

Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 
Post-approval requirements

Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws and regulations. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of requirements for post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


•fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
 •clinical holds on clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 
In addition, the FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are consistent with FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.

Marketing exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.

The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct, or obtain a right of reference to, all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor

conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials.
 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements

In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. These laws include but are not limited to, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations.
 
The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.

In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program.

HIPAA also created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased foreign, federal, and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to health care professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on certain drug, biologics, medical supplies and device manufacturers for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or CHIP for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives), and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Certain foreign countries and U.S. states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs,

impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to health care professionals and entities.
 
Violations of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, reporting obligations and integrity oversight, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payers. Third-party payers decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payer’s determination that use of a therapeutic is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan; 
 •safe, effective and medically necessary; 
 •appropriate for the specific patient; 
 •cost-effective; and 
 •neither experimental nor investigational.
 
The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payer not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products, if approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

In addition, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payer to payer. One third-party payer’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately and will be a time-consuming process.

Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payer is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payer supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payer-by-payer basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A third-party payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payers. Private third-party payers tend to follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement limitations to a substantial degree, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide

coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.

Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures.

The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if third-party payers fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare Reform

A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposed a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.

Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021. The executive order instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, or AMP, beginning January 1, 2024. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship

between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Most recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated.
 
Payment methodologies may also be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory challenges. For example, in order for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. For the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, CMS altered the reimbursement formula from Average Sale Price, or ASP, plus 6 percent to ASP minus 22.5 percent on specified covered outpatient drugs, or SCODs, but did so without issuing a formal notice of proposed rulemaking, which was subsequently challenged in court. In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court held that although the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has authority to set reimbursement rates based on average price and discretion to “adjust” the price up or down, HHS may not vary the reimbursement rates by hospital group unless it conducts a survey of hospitals’ acquisition costs. Accordingly, the U.S. Supreme Court held that HHS’s changes to the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals were unlawful. Based on the foregoing, CMS issued a final rule, effective January 1, 2023, pursuant to which CMS will pay 340B hospitals under Medicare Part B for certain outpatient drugs at the drug’s ASP, plus 6%, the same rate used for non-340B hospitals. It is unclear how future changes to the payment methodology may affect pharmaceutical manufacturers and hospitals who purchase their products now and in the future.
 
Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

We expect that the other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, lower reimbursement, and new payment methodologies. This could lower the price that we receive for any approved product. Any denial in coverage or reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar denial or reduction in payments from private payors, which may prevent us from being able to generate sufficient revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates, if approved.
 
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Cybersecurity
 
In the normal course of business, we may collect and store personal information and certain sensitive company information, including proprietary and confidential business information, trade secrets, intellectual property, information regarding trial participants in connection with clinical trials, sensitive third-party information and employee information. While we have certain cybersecurity measures in place, our security measures cannot guarantee that a significant cyberattack will not occur. A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business. While we devote resources to our security measures to protect our systems and information, these measures cannot provide absolute security. See “Risk Factors –

General Risk Factors” for additional information about the risks to our business associated with a breach or compromise to our information technology systems.

Human Capital Management
 As of March 21, 2023, we had 96 full-time employees, including 10 in technical operations and product development, 14 in clinical development and medical affairs, regulatory affairs, and quality assurance, 20 in commercial, 40 sales representatives and 12 in finance, general administrative and executive administration. All of our employees are located in the U.S., and none are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective.
Recruitment, Retention and Culture
 We recognize that our future success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel, maintain our strong company culture, and ensure diversity and inclusion in our Board of Directors, management and broader workforce. We launched FUROSCIX in February 2023 after successfully building an experienced commercial team and expanded commercial organization to support our future growth. During this period of expansion, we remain committed to our core values and key human capital-related objectives including effectively recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, maintaining and growing a diverse and inclusive workforce, and ensuring a robust culture of compliance. A testament to our strong culture is our third year in a row earning a spot in the Boston Business Journal’s Best Places to Work list for companies of our size.
 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)
 Diversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental to our success and future innovation. We are intentional about including diverse points of view, perspectives, experiences, backgrounds and ideas in our decision-making and hiring processes and practices. For example, the consideration of individuals from underrepresented groups was a key hiring factor during the expansion of the commercial part of our organization.
 
As of March 21, 2023, approximately 33% of our Board of Directors self-identified as female. As of March 21, 2023, approximately 11% of our Board of Directors were individuals from underrepresented groups, i.e., those self-identifying as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, or being of two or more races. Two members of our Board of Directors are military veterans.

Compensation and Benefits
We have designed a broad-based compensation and benefits program that is designed to attract, retain and motivate our employees and believe that our efforts have been successful in this regard. In addition to base salaries and annual bonuses, these programs include a 401(k) plan with generous eligibility and matching features, healthcare and insurance benefits, equity awards, educational assistance and an employee stock purchase plan. Furthermore, benefits are extended to domestic partners.

We are committed to ensuring fair and equitable pay for all of our employees including across genders and underrepresented groups. Our Board of Directors and senior leadership team strongly support this commitment.
