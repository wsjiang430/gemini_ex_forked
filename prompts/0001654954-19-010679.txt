  Our Business Overview
 
 Palatin is a specialized biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class medicines based on molecules that modulate the activity of the melanocortin and natriuretic peptide receptor systems. Our product candidates are targeted, receptor-specific therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with significant unmet medical need and commercial potential.
 
  Melanocortin Receptor System. The melanocortin receptor (“MCr”) system is hormone driven, with effects on food intake, metabolism, sexual function, inflammation and immune system responses. There are five melanocortin receptors, MC1r through MC5r. Modulation of these receptors, through use of receptor-specific agonists, which activate receptor function, or receptor-specific antagonists, which block receptor function, can have significant pharmacological effects.
 
 Our lead product, Vyleesi™, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on June 21, 2019, and is being marketed in North America by AMAG, with product availability in the United States starting in August 2019. Vyleesi is indicated for the treatment of premenopausal women with acquired, generalized HSDD, characterized by low sexual desire that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty not due to a co-existing medical or psychiatric condition, relationship problems, or effects of a medication or drug substance.
 
 Our new product development activities focus primarily on MC1r agonists, with potential to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as dry eye disease, which is also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, uveitis, diabetic retinopathy and inflammatory bowel disease. We believe that the MC1r agonist peptides we are developing have broad anti-inflammatory effects and appear to utilize mechanisms engaged by the endogenous melanocortin system in regulation of the immune system and resolution of inflammatory responses. We are also developing peptides that are active at more than one melanocortin receptor, and MC4r peptide and small molecule agonists with potential utility in obesity and metabolic-related disorders, including rare disease and orphan indications.
 
  Natriuretic Peptide Receptor System. The natriuretic peptide receptor (“NPR”) system regulates cardiovascular functions, and therapeutic agents modulating this system have potential to treat fibrotic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, including reducing cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, heart failure, acute asthma, pulmonary diseases and hypertension. We have designed and are developing potential NPR candidate drugs selective for one or more different natriuretic peptide receptors, including natriuretic peptide receptor-A (“NPR-A”), natriuretic peptide receptor B (“NPR-B”), and natriuretic peptide receptor C (“NPR-C”).
 
  Our Business Strategy. Key elements of our business strategy include:
 
   ●
 Maximizing revenue from Vyleesi by supporting our existing licensees and licensing Vyleesi for global areas outside of North America, China and South Korea. We received a $60.0 million milestone payment from AMAG on approval of the New Drug Application (“NDA”) for Vyleesi by the FDA;


   ●
 Assembling and maintaining a team to create, develop and commercialize MCr and NPR products addressing unmet medical needs;


   ●
 Entering into strategic alliances and partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to facilitate the development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of product candidates that we are developing;


   ●
 Partially funding our product development programs with the cash flow generated from existing license agreements, as well as any future research, collaboration or license agreements; and


   ●
 Completing development and seeking regulatory approval of certain of our other product candidates.


  Pipeline Overview
 
 The following chart illustrates the status of our drug development programs and Vyleesi, which has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of premenopausal women with acquired, generalized HSDD.

  Melanocortin Receptor Programs
 
  Vyleesi for HSDD. Vyleesi, the tradename for bremelanotide, was approved by the FDA on June 21, 2019 for the treatment of premenopausal women with acquired, generalized HSDD. Our exclusive North American licensee, AMAG, initiated sales and marketing efforts for Vyleesi in the United States in August 2019, with a full national launch expected in the second half of September 2019.
 
 Vyleesi is an FDA approved, as-needed treatment for premenopausal women with HSDD. Vyleesi is dosed in anticipation of sexual activity via a single-use subcutaneous auto-injector. The FDA approval of Vyleesi was primarily based on safety and efficacy data from approximately 1,200 women enrolled in two pivotal, identically-designed Phase 3 studies conducted by Palatin. These studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of Vyleesi for the treatment of HSDD in premenopausal women as compared to placebo. Both trials consisted of a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized parallel group core study phase, comparing a subcutaneous dose of 1.75 mg Vyleesi versus placebo, self-administered via an auto-injector, on demand, with patients equally randomized (1:1 ratio) to either Vyleesi or placebo groups. The co-primary endpoints for these trials were evaluated using patient self-reported scores from Question One and Two of the Female Sexual Function Index: Desire Domain (“FSFI-D”) and Question 13 from the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Desires/Arousal/Orgasm (“FSDS-DAO”). Women who completed the randomized control core study phase of either study had the option to continue in a voluntary open-label safety extension phase of the study for an additional 12 months, which gathered additional data on the safety of long-term and repeated use of Vyleesi. Nearly 80% of patients who completed the Phase 3 trials elected to remain in the open-label portion of the study, in which all patients received Vyleesi.
 
 Both studies met the pre-specified co-primary efficacy endpoints of improvement in low sexual desire and decrease in related distress as measured using validated patient-reported outcome instruments and demonstrated statistically significant improvement with Vyleesi in both median and mean measures of desire. The change in the number of satisfying sexual events, a key secondary endpoint, was not significantly different from placebo in either clinical trial.

 In the Phase 3 clinical trials and the extension study, the most frequent adverse events were nausea, flushing, injection site reactions, and headache. In the clinical trials approximately 18% of patients receiving Vyleesi discontinued participation due to adverse events compared to 2% in placebo. In addition, in the clinical trials Vyleesi caused small, transient increases in blood pressure, and is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled high blood pressure or known cardiovascular disease.
 
 The 2006 PRESIDE (Prevalence of Female Sexual Problems Associated with Distress and Determinants of Treatment Seeking) study, a cross-sectional, population-based survey of 31,581 female adult respondents in the United States published in 2008 in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, found that approximately 22% of women reported a sexual problem and 11% were women with HSDD. Based on the number of premenopausal women in the United States according to the U.S. Census, the presenting market size of premenopausal women with primary HSDD is at least 5.8 million women. Despite one FDA-approved HSDD therapy on the market today for pre-menopausal women, we believe that patient awareness and understanding of the condition is extremely low, and as a result few women currently seek treatment. HSDD may go undiagnosed due to various factors such as embarrassment or stigma, lack of awareness of low sexual desire as a medical condition or attribution to other external factors, such as stress or fatigue.
 
 In January 2017, we entered into a license agreement with AMAG, pursuant to which we granted AMAG an exclusive license in all countries of North America, with the right to grant sublicenses, to research, develop and commercialize products containing Vyleesi. AMAG also has a non-exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to manufacture products containing Vyleesi in North America, and to research, develop and manufacture, but not commercialize, products containing Vyleesi in countries outside North America. Upon the license agreement becoming effective on February 2, 2017, AMAG paid us $60.0 million as a one-time initial payment, and has reimbursed us $25.0 million for direct out-of-pocket expenses incurred in development and regulatory activities necessary to file an NDA, less certain expenses directly paid by AMAG. Upon the FDA acceptance of the Vyleesi NDA filing for HSDD, AMAG paid us a $20.0 million milestone payment less agreed deductions for expenses incurred by AMAG, and upon FDA approval of Vyleesi, AMAG paid us a $60.0 million milestone payment. In addition, we may receive up to $300.0 million in sales milestone payments based on achievement of certain annual net sales amounts of products containing Vyleesi. AMAG will also pay tiered royalties on annual net sales of products containing Vyleesi at rates ranging from the high single-digits to the low double-digits.
 
 In early September 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Fosun for exclusive rights to commercialize Vyleesi in China. We received an upfront payment of $5.0 million, less required tax withholding, and when regulatory approval for a Vyleesi product is obtained in China we will receive a $7.5 million milestone payment. We may receive up to $92.5 million in sales related milestones and will receive high-single digit to low double-digit royalties on net sales in China. In November 2017 we entered into a license agreement with Kwangdong for exclusive rights to commercialize Vyleesi in Korea, and received an upfront payment of $0.5 million, less required tax withholding. Upon the first commercial sale of Vyleesi in Korea we will receive a $3.0 million milestone payment and will receive mid-single digit to low double-digit royalties on all net sales and may receive up to $37.5 million in sales related milestones.
 
 We retain worldwide rights for Vyleesi for HSDD and all other indications outside North America, Korea and China. We are actively seeking potential partners for marketing and commercialization rights for Vyleesi for HSDD outside the licensed territories. However, we may not be able to enter into suitable agreements with potential partners on acceptable terms, if at all.
 
  Our New Peptide Development Strategy. We are designing and developing potent and highly selective MC1r agonist peptides and agonist peptides specific for more than one melanocortin receptor for treatment of a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune indications. In animal models our peptides agonists, as well as the endogenous agonist alpha-MSH, can reduce inflammation and potentially resolve chronic inflammatory conditions. We believe that our agonist peptides suppress certain inflammatory cytokines, and modulate the activities of immune cells, such as monocytes and T cells, to reduce immune response, and may utilize mechanisms engaged by the endogenous melanocortin system in regulation of the immune system and resolution of inflammatory responses.
 
 We have conducted preclinical animal studies with MC1r and multiple MCr peptide drug candidates for selected inflammatory disease and autoimmune indications. MC1r plays a role in many diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and ocular indications such as uveitis, diabetic retinopathy and dry eye disease. Work with rodent animal models have demonstrated therapeutic responses that are statistically significant compared to placebo, and that are equal to or superior to established positive controls in animal models. However, success in animal models does not necessarily mean that any of our drug candidates will be able to successfully treat diseases in human patients.
 
  Oral PL8177 for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. PL8177, a selective MC1r agonist peptide, is our lead clinical development candidate for inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis. PL8177 is a cyclic peptide comprised of seven amino acids. We filed an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application on PL8177 in late 2017 and in 2018 successfully completed subcutaneous dosing of human subjects in a Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose clinical safety study.
 
 For ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases we will administer PL8177 in an oral formulation designed to deliver PL8177 to the interior wall of the diseased bowel. PL8177 activates MC1r present on the interior wall of the bowel in ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases. We believe that delivering PL8177 directly to MC1r in the bowel wall will maximize treatment effect while minimizing any systemic or off-target effects.

 In early 2019 we completed a micro-dose clinical study of radiolabeled PL8177 in healthy subjects using an oral, delayed-release, polymer formulation. The micro-dose study demonstrated release of polymer bound PL8177 in the lower gastrointestinal tract after oral administration with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. The study also demonstrated that with the oral formulation PL8177 was not systemically absorbed.
 
 A Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis using the oral, delayed-release, polymer formulation of PL8177 is scheduled to start in the first half of calendar 2020.
 
  Systemic PL8177 for Non-Infectious Uveitis. PL8177 has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior, pan and chronic anterior uveitis. Non-infectious uveitis is a group of inflammatory diseases that produces swelling and destroys eye tissue and can result in vision loss. A Phase 2 study in non-infectious uveitis using a systemic delivery formulation of PL8177 is scheduled to start in the first half of calendar year 2020, with data anticipated in the first half of calendar year 2021.
 
  PL9643 for Anti-Inflammatory Ocular Indications. PL9643, a peptide melanocortin agonist active at multiple MCrs, including MC1r and MC5r, is our lead clinical development candidate for anti-inflammatory ocular indications, including dry eye disease, which is also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Dry eye disease is a syndrome with symptoms including irritation, redness, discharge and blurred vision. It may result from an autoimmune disease such Sjögren’s syndrome, an ocular lipid or mucin deficiency, blink disorders, abnormal corneal sensitivity or environmental factors.
 
 We have developed an aqueous eye drop formulation which will be used in clinical trials in a single use delivery device. We have held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA on Phase 2 study design and the overall development program through Phase 3 registration studies. We intend to submit an IND to the FDA as early as the fourth quarter of calendar year 2019 and to initiate clinical trials as soon thereafter as possible. Data from our Phase 2 clinical trial is expected as early as the first half of calendar year 2020.
 
  MC4r Agonist Peptide & Small Molecule. We have ongoing preclinical programs with MC4r peptides and orally active MC4r-specific small molecules for treatment of rare genetic metabolic and obesity disorders, and if results are favorable, anticipate selecting a lead clinical development candidate. In developing our compounds, we examined effectiveness in animal models of sexual response and obesity, and also determined cardiovascular effects, primarily looking at changes in blood pressure. Results of these studies, including studies of weight loss in diet-induced obese mice, leptin-deficient mice and MC4r knockout mice with orally administered MC4r compounds, suggest that certain of these compounds may have significant medical and commercial potential for treatment of conditions responsive to MC4r activation, including certain orphan and rare disease indications. We are continuing preclinical development work, including evaluating the potential for orphan designation under the Orphan Drug Act.
 
  Natriuretic Peptide Receptor Programs
 
  Natriuretic Peptide Receptor Systems. The NPR system has numerous cardiovascular functions, and therapeutic agents modulating this system may be useful in treatment of cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases. While the therapeutic potential of modulating this system is well appreciated, development of therapeutic agents has been difficult due, in part, to the short biological half-life of native peptide agonists. We have made potential NPR candidate drugs that are selective for one or more different natriuretic peptide receptors, including NPR-A, NPR-B, and NPR-C.
 
  PL3994 for Mechanism of Action Studies. PL3994 is an NPR-A agonist and synthetic mimetic of the endogenous neuropeptide hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (“ANP”). PL3994 activates NPR-A, a receptor known to play a role in cardiovascular homeostasis. Consistent with being an NPR-A agonist, PL3994 increases plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate (“cGMP”) levels, a pharmacological response consistent with the effects of endogenous natriuretic peptides on cardiovascular function and smooth muscle relaxation. PL3994 also decreases activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (“RAAS”), a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. The RAAS system is frequently over-activated in heart failure patients, leading to worsening of cardiovascular function.
 
 In conjunction with clinicians at a major research institution, PL3994 is entering Phase 2A clinical trial supported by a grant from the American Heart Association in the second half of calendar year 2019. We have conducted Phase 1 safety studies with PL3994, with no serious or severe adverse events. Consistent with the PL3994 mechanism of action, elevations in plasma cGMP levels, increased diuresis and increased natriuresis were all observed for several hours after single subcutaneous doses.
 
 Because of the limited patent term remaining on PL3994, we do not intend to pursue PL3994 as a pharmaceutical product but are utilizing it to establish the mechanism of action and pharmaceutical utility of synthetic mimetics of ANP.
 
  PL5028 for Cardiovascular and Fibrotic Disease. PL5028, a dual NPR-A and NPR-C agonist we developed, is in preclinical development for cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases, including reducing cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. We have ongoing academic collaborations with several institutions with PL5028.

  Technologies We Use
 
 We used a rational drug design approach to discover and develop proprietary peptide, peptide mimetic and small molecule agonist compounds, focusing on melanocortin and natriuretic peptide receptor systems. Computer-aided drug design models of receptors are optimized based on experimental results obtained with peptides and small molecules that we develop. With our approach, we believe we are developing an advanced understanding of the factors which drive agonism.
 
 We have developed a series of proprietary technologies used in our drug development programs. One technology employs novel amino acid mimetics in place of selected amino acids. These mimetics provide the receptor-binding functions of conventional amino acids while providing structural, functional and physiochemical advantages. The amino acid mimetic technology is employed in PL3994, our compound in development for treatment of heart failure.
 
 Some compound series have been derived using our proprietary and patented platform technology, called MIDAS™, or Metal Ion-induced Distinctive Array of Structures. This technology employs metal ions to fix the three-dimensional configuration of peptides, forming conformationally rigid molecules that remain folded specifically in their active state. These MIDAS molecules are generally simple to synthesize, are chemically and proteolytically stable, and have the potential to be orally bioavailable. In addition, MIDAS molecules are information-rich and provide data on structure-activity relationships that may be used to design small molecule, non-peptide drugs.
 
  Competition
 
  General. Our products under development will compete on the basis of quality, performance, cost effectiveness and application suitability with numerous established products and technologies. We have many competitors, including pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Furthermore, there are several well-established products in our target markets that we will have to compete against. Other companies may also introduce products using new technologies that may be competitive with our proposed products. Most of the companies selling or developing competitive products have financial, technological, manufacturing and distribution resources significantly greater than ours and may represent significant competition for us. In addition, approved products such as Vyleesi may eventually face competition from generic versions that will sell at significantly reduced prices, be preferred by managed care and health insurance payers, and be eligible for automatic pharmacy substitution even when a prescriber writes a prescription for our product. The timing and extent of future generic competition is dependent upon both our intellectual property rights and the FDA regulatory process but cannot be accurately predicted.
 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological change. Many biopharmaceutical companies have developed or are working to develop products similar to ours or that address the same markets. Such companies may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective or less costly than any of those that we may develop. Such companies may be more successful than us in developing, manufacturing and marketing products.
 
 We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that developments by others will not render our proposed products under development or any future product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive or that our collaborators or customers will not choose to use competing technologies or products.
 
  Vyleesi for Treatment of HSDD. There is competition and financial incentive to develop, market and sell drugs for the treatment of HSDD and other forms of FSD. Flibanserin, sold under the trade name Addyi®, is the only drug currently approved in the United States for treatment of HSDD. Flibanserin, a non-hormonal oral serotonin 5-HT1A agonist, 5-HT2A antagonist, which requires chronic dosing, was approved by the FDA on August 18, 2015 for treatment of premenopausal women with HSDD. The FDA approval included a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) because of the increased risk of severe hypotension and syncope due to the interaction between flibanserin and alcohol, and a Boxed Warning to highlight the risks of severe hypotension and syncope in patients who drink alcohol during treatment with flibanserin, in those who also use moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, and in those who have liver impairment. We are aware of several other drugs at various stages of development, most of which are taken on a chronic, typically once-daily, basis. There are other companies reported to be developing new drugs for FSD indications, some of which may be in clinical trials in the United States or elsewhere. We are not aware of any other company actively developing a melanocortin receptor agonist drug for HSDD.
 
  Melanocortin Receptor 1 Agonist Drug Products for Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases. Many inflammatory disease-related indications are treated using systemic steroids or immunosuppressant drugs, all of which have side effects that can be dose limiting. There are a number of approved biological drugs and other biological drugs under development for treatment of inflammatory disease-related indications, which typically affect only one pathway in the inflammatory response. Many of these drugs address symptoms, but do not resolve the underlying inflammatory or autoimmune disease process.

  Oral PL8177 for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/Ulcerative Colitis. FDA-approved drugs used in treatment of ulcerative colitis include aminosalicylates such as mesalazine and related drugs, immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine and azathioprine, corticosteroids such as prednisone and other steroids, and various biologic drugs, including tumor necrosis factor inhibitors such as infliximab and adalimumab. There are a number of drugs in development for ulcerative colitis, including Janus kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies specific for one or more immune system cytokine signaling molecules, and additional classes of immunomodulatory drugs. There are no reported MC1r agonist drugs in clinical trials for inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis. If one or more of the competing products under development are approved and can effectively treat ulcerative colitis with an acceptable side effect profile, such products could reduce the market for oral PL8177 for inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis.
 
  Systemic PL8177 for Non-Infectious Uveitis. FDA-approved drugs used in treatment of non-infectious uveitis include immunosuppressive medications such as adalimumab, sold under the brand name Humira® and other brand names, and corticosteroids such as prednisone and other steroids. There are other products in development, including tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and interleukin receptor agonists such as gevokizumab, as well as formulations of glucocorticoid receptor agonists. There are no reported MC1r agonist drugs in clinical trials for non-infectious uveitis. If one or more the competing product candidates under development is approved and can resolve non-infectious uveitis with an acceptable side effect profile, it could reduce the market for system PL8177 for this indication.
 
  PL9643 for Anti-Inflammatory Ocular Indications. PL9643 is under development for dry eye diseases and may also have utility for other inflammatory ocular indications. Mild to moderate dry eye disease and other ocular inflammatory diseases may be treated with artificial tear eye drops, lubricating tear ointments, hot compresses or punctual plugs, but more severe disease may be treated with topical immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsions, including Restasis® marketed in the United States by Allergan, Inc., or with drugs inhibiting inflammatory cell binding, such as lifitegrast, including Xiidra® marketed in the United States by Shire US Inc. In addition, there are a number of drugs in clinical development for treatment of dry eye disease, with over 20 agents reported to be in or have completed Phase 2 development. Products under development include tumor necrosis factor agonists, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, calcineurin inhibitors and nicotinic receptor agonists, among others. There are no reported MC1r agonist drugs in clinical trials for dry eye disease. If one or more of these competing product candidates is approved and either treats the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease or reduces the frequency of flares of dry eye in patients, it could reduce the market for PL9643 for dry eye disease.
 
  Obesity and Related Indications. There are a number of FDA-approved drugs and medical devices for the treatment of obesity, and a large number of products in clinical development by other companies, including products which target melanocortin receptors. Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is reported to have completed Phase 3 clinical trials with an MC4r agonist peptide drug for rare genetic disorders of obesity.
 
  PL5028 for Cardiovascular and Fibrotic Indications. We are evaluating potential clinical indications for PL5028, and have not determined a specific indication for initial studies. There are many approved drugs and drugs in clinical studies for cardiovascular diseases, including drugs that directly modulate the NPR system, such as nesiritide (sold under the trade name Natrecor®), a recombinant NPR-B peptide drug, and a combination drug comprised of sacubitril and valsartan (sold under the trade name Entresto®), which inhibits both the angiotensin II receptor and neprilysin, which is an enzyme that inactivates endogenous active natriuretic peptides. This combination drug results in increases of endogenous active ANP levels. In addition, there are a number of approved drugs and drugs in development for treatment of cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases through mechanisms or pathways other than agonism of NPR-A.
 
  Patents and Proprietary Information
 
  Patent Protection. Our success will depend in substantial part on our ability to obtain, defend and enforce patents, maintain trade secrets and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, both in the United States and abroad. We own a number of issued United States patents and have pending United States patent applications, many with issued or pending counterpart patents in selected foreign countries. We seek patent protection for our technologies and products in the United States and those foreign countries where we believe patent protection is commercially important.
 
 We own three issued United States patents and a pending patent application in the United States for methods of treating FSD with Vyleesi, with related patents issued in Australia, South Africa, the Republic of Georgia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom and related patent applications pending in Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Ukraine and Vietnam. Under our license agreement with AMAG, AMAG has assumed responsibility for prosecution in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We do not know the full scope of patent coverage we will obtain, or whether any patents will issue other than the patents already issued. Issued patents and pending applications in the United States and elsewhere in the world have a presumptive term, if a patent is issued, until 2033.

 We own two issued United States patents claiming the Vyleesi drug substance. The issued United States patents have a term until 2020, and the term of one patent may be subject to extension for a maximum period of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during drug development and the FDA regulatory review process, pursuant to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. An application for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments has been submitted, but the length of any such extension has not been determined. In addition, the claims of issued patents covering Vyleesi may not provide meaningful protection. Further, third parties may challenge the validity or scope of any issued patent, and under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, potentially receive approval of a competing generic version of our product or products even before a court rules on the validity or infringement of our patents.
 
 We own patents on an alternative class of melanocortin receptor-specific peptides for treatment of sexual dysfunction and other indications, including obesity, consisting of two issued patents in the United States. The presumptive term of the issued patents is until 2029. We also have patents and pending patent applications for a second class of alternative melanocortin receptor-specific peptides for treatment of sexual dysfunction and other indications, including obesity, consisting of three issued patents in the United States and issued patents in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Israel, Korea, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom and pending patent applications on the same class in Brazil, China, India, and Mexico. The presumptive term of the issued patents and pending patent applications is until 2030. Until one or more product candidates covered by a claim of one of these patents and patent applications are developed for commercialization, which may never occur, we cannot evaluate the duration of any potential patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.
 
 We own four issued patents in the United States, and issued patents in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom claiming highly selective MC1r agonist peptides, including for treatment of inflammation-related diseases and disorders and related indications, and pending patent applications in Australia, Brazil, and India. The presumptive term of the issued patents and pending patent applications is until 2030. Until one or more product candidates covered by a claim of one of these patent applications are developed for commercialization, which may never occur, we cannot evaluate the duration of any potential patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.
 
 We own two issued United States patents claiming the PL3994 substance and other natriuretic peptide receptor agonist compounds that we have developed and an issued United States patent claiming a precursor molecule to the PL3994 substance, both of which expire in 2027. Corresponding patents on the PL3994 substance and other natriuretic peptide receptor agonist compounds were issued in a number of countries throughout the world, but we do not intend to develop a PL3994 product for commercialization and will cease maintaining patents outside the United States. We also own an issued United States patent claiming use of the PL3994 substance for treatment of acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which expires in 2031. We additionally have 35 issued United States patents on melanocortin receptor specific peptides and small molecules, and five issued United States patents on natriuretic peptide receptor agonist compounds, but we are not actively developing any product candidate covered by a claim of any of these patents.
 
 In the event that a third party has also filed a patent application relating to an invention we claimed in a patent application, we may be required to participate in an interference proceeding adjudicated by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) to determine priority of invention. The possibility of an interference proceeding could result in substantial uncertainties and cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. An adverse outcome could result in the loss of patent protection for the subject of the interference, subjecting us to significant liabilities to third parties, the need to obtain licenses from third parties at undetermined cost, or requiring us to cease using the technology. Additionally, the claims of our issued patents may be narrowed or invalidated by administrative proceedings, such as interference or derivation, inter partes review, post grant review or reexamination proceedings before the USPTO.
 
  Future Patent Infringement. We do not know for certain that our commercial activities will not infringe upon patents or patent applications of third parties, some of which may not even have been issued. Although we are not aware of any valid United States patents which are infringed by Vyleesi or our other product candidates, we cannot exclude the possibility that such patents might exist or arise in the future. We may be unable to avoid infringement of any such patents and may have to seek a license, defend an infringement action, or challenge the validity of such patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. If such patents are valid and we do not obtain a license under any such patents, or we are found liable for infringement, we may be liable for significant monetary damages, may encounter significant delays in bringing products to market, or may be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of products or methods of treatment covered by such patents.
 
  Proprietary Information. We rely on proprietary information, such as trade secrets and know-how, which is not patented. We have taken steps to protect our unpatented trade secrets and know-how, in part with confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with our employees, consultants and certain contractors. If our employees, scientific consultants, collaborators or licensees develop inventions or processes independently that may be applicable to our product candidates, disputes may arise about the ownership of proprietary rights to those inventions and processes. Such inventions and processes will not necessarily become our property but may remain the property of those persons or their employers. Protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights.
 
 If trade secrets are breached, our recourse will be solely against the person who caused the secrecy breach. This might not be an adequate remedy to us because third parties other than the person who causes the breach will be free to use the information without accountability to us. This is an inherent limitation of the law of trade secret protection.

  U.S. Governmental Regulation of Pharmaceutical Products
 
  General
 
 Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries will continue to significantly impact our research, product development, manufacturing and marketing of any pharmaceutical products. The nature and the extent to which regulations apply to us will vary depending on the nature of any such products. Our potential pharmaceutical products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. The products we are developing are subject to federal regulation in the United States, principally by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), and by state and local governments, as well as ministries of health and other authorities in foreign governments. Such regulations govern or influence, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety and efficacy requirements, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, licensing, advertising, promotion, distribution and export of products, manufacturing and the manufacturing process. In many foreign countries, such regulations also govern the prices charged for products under their respective national social security systems and availability to consumers.
 
 All drugs intended for human use are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA in the United States and similar regulatory bodies in other countries. The steps ordinarily required by the FDA before an innovative new drug product may be marketed in the United States are similar to steps required in most other countries and include, but are not limited to:
 
   ●
 completion of preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal testing and formulation studies;


   ●
 submission to the FDA of an IND, which must be in effect before clinical trials may commence;


   ●
 clinical studies to evaluate safety and efficacy;


   ●
 submission to the FDA of an NDA that includes preclinical data, clinical trial data and manufacturing information;


   ●
 payment of substantial user fees for filing the NDA and other recurring user fees;


   ●
 FDA review of the NDA;


   ●
 satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities; and


   ●
 FDA approval of the NDA, including approval of all product labeling.


 For new drug products or for combination products deemed to have a “drug” primary mode of action, primary review of the product will be conducted by the appropriate division within the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”). For combination products, CDER will consult with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health to ensure that the device components of the product meet all applicable device requirements.
 
 The research, development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and approvals may not be granted on a timely or commercially viable basis, if at all.

 Preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluations to characterize the product’s composition, impurities, stability, and mechanism of its pharmacologic effect, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of each product. Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA regulations regarding Good Laboratory Practices and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act. Violations of these laws and regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the tests, requiring such tests to be repeated and delaying approval of the NDA. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of human clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to an IND by placing the study on clinical hold, the IND will go into effect 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. The FDA may authorize trials only on specified terms and may suspend ongoing clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. If the FDA places a study on clinical hold, the sponsor must resolve all of the FDA’s concerns before the study may begin or continue. The IND application process may become extremely costly and substantially delay development of products. Similar restrictive requirements also apply in other countries. Additionally, positive results of preclinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in clinical trials.
 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to humans under the supervision of qualified principal investigators. Our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice regulations under protocols submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. In addition, each clinical trial is approved and conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board (“IRB”) and requires the patients’ informed consent. An IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possibility of liability of the institutions conducting the trial. The IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a belief that the test subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. As the sponsor, we can also suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time.
 
 Clinical development is typically conducted in three sequential phases, Phases 1, 2, and 3, involving clinical trials with increasing numbers of human subjects. These phases may sometimes overlap or be combined. Phase 1 trials are performed in a small number of healthy human subjects or subjects with the targeted condition, and involve testing for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Phase 2 studies, which may involve up to hundreds of subjects, seek to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, preliminary information related to the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage. Finally, Phase 3 trials may involve up to thousands of individuals often at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, and are intended to provide the data demonstrating the effectiveness and safety required for approval. Prior to commencing Phase 3 clinical trials many sponsors elect to meet with FDA officials to discuss the conduct and design of the proposed trial or trials.
 
 In addition, federal law requires the listing, on a publicly available website, of detailed information on clinical trials for investigational drugs. Some states have similar or supplemental clinical trial reporting laws.
 
 Success in early-stage animal studies and clinical trials does not necessarily assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from animal studies and clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or even prevent regulatory approval.
 
 All data obtained from the preclinical studies and clinical trials, in addition to detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, would be submitted in an NDA to the FDA for review and approval for the manufacture, marketing and commercial shipments of any of our products. FDA approval of the NDA is required before commercial marketing or non-investigational interstate shipment may begin in the United States. The FDA may also conduct an audit of the clinical trial data used to support the NDA.
 
 The FDA may deny or delay approval of an NDA that does not meet applicable regulatory criteria. For example, the FDA may determine that the preclinical or clinical data or the manufacturing information does not adequately establish the safety and efficacy of the drug. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with an applicant’s interpretation of the data submitted in its NDA. The FDA can request additional information, seek clarification regarding information already provided in the submission or ask that new additional clinical trials be conducted, all of which can delay approval. Similar types of regulatory processes will be encountered as efforts are made to market any drug internationally. We will be required to assure product performance and manufacturing processes from one country to another.
 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved uses for the product as described in the product labeling, require that contraindications, warning statements or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval or limit labeling. Once it approves an NDA, the FDA may revoke or suspend the product approval if compliance with post-market regulatory commitments is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-market studies. The FDA and other government agencies have broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy civil and criminal penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and revoke approvals.

 Pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities with the FDA and state agencies. Manufacturers are required to list their marketed drugs with the FDA, are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other authorities, where applicable, and must comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) regulations, and the product specifications set forth in the approved NDA. The GMP requirements for pharmaceutical products are extensive and compliance with them requires considerable time, resources and ongoing investment. The regulations require manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials and components to establish validated systems and to employ and train qualified employees to ensure that products meet high standards of safety, efficacy, stability, sterility (where applicable), purity, and potency. The requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the synthesis, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug product. For all drug products, the regulations require investigation and correction of any deviations from GMP requirements and impose documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Manufacturing establishments are subject to mandatory user fees, and to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with all GMP requirements. The FDA is authorized to inspect manufacturing facilities without a warrant at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner.
 
 We or our present or future suppliers may not be able to comply with GMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer and/or the NDA sponsor or distributor to possible legal or regulatory action, such as a delay or refusal to approve an NDA, suspension of manufacturing, seizure or recall of a product, or civil or criminal prosecution of the company or individual officers or employees.
 
  Post-Marketing Regulation
 
 Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals, as well as the materials and components used in our products, are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including:
 
   ●
 recordkeeping requirements;


   ●
 periodic reporting requirements;


   ●
 GMP requirements related to all stages of manufacturing, testing, storage, packaging, labeling and distribution of finished dosage forms of the product;


   ●
 monitoring and reporting of adverse experiences with the product; and


   ●
 advertising and promotional reporting requirements and restrictions.


 Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of market restriction through labeling changes or product removal. Product approvals may be revoked if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or effectiveness of the product occur following approval. The FDA is developing a national electronic drug safety tracking system known as SENTINEL that may impose additional safety monitoring burdens, and enhanced FDA enforcement authority, beyond the extensive requirements already in effect. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor a product’s safety or efficacy. The FDA also may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions which can materially impact the potential market and profitability of a product.
 
 With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA and other government agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice, and individual States, impose a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, including, among others, standards and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FFDCA, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in administrative and judicial enforcement actions, including the issuance of a Warning Letter directing correction of deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, False Claims Act prosecution based on alleged off-label marketing seeking monetary and other penalties, including potential exclusion of the drug and/or the company from participation in government health care programs, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. Foreign regulatory bodies also strictly enforce these and other regulatory requirements and drug marketing may be prohibited in whole or in part in other countries.

 We, our collaborators, licensees or third-party contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with the applicable regulations. After regulatory approvals are obtained, the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems, or the failure to maintain compliance with existing or new regulatory requirements, may result in:
 
   ●
 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product;


   ●
 Warning Letters or Untitled Letters from the FDA asking us, our collaborators or third-party contractors to take or refrain from taking certain actions;


   ●
 withdrawal of the product from the market;


   ●
 the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;


   ●
 voluntary or mandatory product recall;


   ●
 fines or disgorgement of profits or revenue;


   ●
 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;


   ●
 refusals to permit the import or export of products;


   ●
 product seizure; and


   ●
 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.


 We may also be subject to healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement and our failure to comply with any such laws, regulations or enforcement could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. Certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable to our business. We are subject to regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we or our partners conduct our business. The laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:
 
   ●
 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or in return for the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;


   ●
 federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including, for example, the federal civil False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;


   ●
 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private), knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;


  
11


 

   ●
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered entities, including healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;


   ●
 the federal physician sunshine requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“Affordable Care Act”), which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and


   ●
 state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be provided to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.


 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 
 Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. In addition, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws or regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, individual imprisonment or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 
  Generic Competition
 
  Orange Book Listing. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, the applicant identifies all patents that claim the approved product’s active ingredient(s), the drug product’s approved formulation, or an approved method of use of the drug. Each of the identified patents are then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing, unless such testing is waived by the FDA, as is the case with some injectable drug products, to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can usually be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify either that: (1) the required patent information has not been filed (a Paragraph I Certification); (2) the listed patent has expired (a Paragraph II Certification); (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and the generic approval is being sought only after patent expiration (a Paragraph III Certification); or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the proposed generic product (a Paragraph IV Certification). In certain circumstances, the ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a “section (viii)” statement instead of a Paragraph IV Certification, certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the application contains only Paragraph I or Paragraph II Certifications, the ANDA may be approved as soon as FDA completes its review and concludes that all approval requirements have been met. If the ANDA contains one or more Paragraph III Certifications, the ANDA cannot not be approved until each listed patent for which a Paragraph III Certification was filed have expired.
 
  
12


 

 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA holder and patent owner once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The patent owner or NDA holder may then commence a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months (the “30-month stay”), expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit in which the patent owner admits that the patent is invalid or not infringed by the ANDA product, or a decision in the infringement case that holds the patent to be invalid or not infringed, or an order by the court shortening the 30-month stay due to actions by the patent holder to delay the litigation. In most circumstances, NDA holder is only eligible for one 30-month stay against an ANDA.
 
 If a patent infringement action is filed against an ANDA applicant, any settlement of the litigation must be submitted to the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). If the FTC believes the terms or effects of the settlement are anticompetitive, FTC may bring an antitrust enforcement action against the parties. Private parties may also bring antitrust lawsuits against drug companies based on such patent litigation settlements.
 
 The ANDA also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent regulatory exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
 
  Regulatory Exclusivity. Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (“NCE”), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot receive for review any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. An ANDA containing a Paragraph IV Certification may be received by FDA 4 years after the NCE drug’s approval, but any 30-month stay that ensues would be extended so that it expires seven and one half years after the NCE approval date, subject to early termination by reason of a court decision or settlement as described above.
 
 Certain changes to an NDA drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, for which new clinical trials, conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the change, can be eligible for a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. An ANDA that contains a section (viii) statement to a method of use patent may be approved with labeling that omits the patented use before the use patent expires. Generic drugs approved with such a labeling carve out may be substituted by pharmacists for the original branded drug before the method of use patent expires.
 
  Section 505(b)(2) NDAs. Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application.
 
 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. A 505(b)(2) NDA may be used where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication or conditions of use sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the expiration of any 30-month stay, subject to early termination of the stay as described above.
 
  Changing Legal and Regulatory Landscape
 
 Periodically, legislation is introduced in the U.S. Congress that could change the statutory and regulatory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of our drugs. In addition, the FFDCA, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA or the courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and products. We cannot predict whether or when legislation or court decisions impacting our business will be enacted or issued, what FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations may change, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be in the future.

  Third-Party Reimbursements
 
 Successful sales of our proposed products in the United States and other countries depend, in large part, on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party payers such as governmental entities, managed care organizations, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), and private insurance plans. Reimbursement by a third-party payer depends on a number of factors, including the payer’s determination that the product has been approved by the FDA for the indication for which the claim is being made, that it is neither experimental nor investigational, and that the use of the product is safe and efficacious, medically necessary, appropriate for the specific patient and cost effective.
 
 Since reimbursement by one payer does not guarantee reimbursement by another, we or our licensees may be required to seek approval from each payer individually. Seeking such approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. Third-party payers routinely limit the products that they will cover and the amount of money that they will pay and, in many instances, are exerting significant pressure on medical suppliers to lower their prices.
 
 Payers frequently employ a tiered system in reimbursing end users for pharmaceutical products, with tier designation affecting copay or deductible amounts. The only approved product for treating HSDD is flibanserin, sold under the trade name Addyi®. There is significant uncertainty concerning the extent and scope of third-party reimbursement for products treating HSDD. Based on third-party reimbursement for approved products treating ED, we believe Vyleesi will be classified as a Tier 3 drug, so that reimbursement will be limited for Vyleesi for treatment of premenopausal women with HSDD, assuming the product is approved by the FDA. Less than full reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payers may adversely affect the market acceptance of Vyleesi. Further, healthcare reimbursement systems vary from country to country, and third-party reimbursement might not be made available for Vyleesi for HSDD under any other reimbursement system.
 
  Manufacturing and Marketing
 
 To be successful, our proposed products will need to be manufactured in commercial quantities under GMP prescribed by the FDA and at acceptable costs. We do not have the facilities to manufacture any of our proposed products under GMP. We intend to rely on collaborators, licensees or contract manufacturers for the commercial manufacture of our proposed products.
 
 Vyleesi is manufactured by AMAG, our exclusive North American licensee, using contract manufacturing companies. Pursuant to the license agreement, we have transferred contracts and our manufacturing methodologies to AMAG. We are negotiating a commercial supply agreement with AMAG pursuant to which AMAG will supply our licensees throughout the world.
 
 Our PL3994 product candidate is a peptide mimetic molecule, incorporating a proprietary amino acid mimetic structure and amino acids. We have had a contract manufacturer make the active pharmaceutical ingredient in quantities sufficient for Phase 1 and Phase 2.
 
 Our MC1r and MCr agonist product candidates are synthetic peptides. We have had a contract manufacturer make both the PL8177 and PL9643 peptides in suitable scale for toxicity studies and under GMP for clinical trial use. The PL8177 drug product for uveitis has been manufactured for clinical trial use, and manufacturing process development is ongoing for an oral formulation of PL8177 preparatory to manufacturing oral PL8177 drug product for clinical trial use. While the production process for making peptide active pharmaceutical ingredient involves well-established technology, there are few manufacturers capable of scaling up to commercial quantities under GMP at acceptable costs. Additionally, scaling up to commercial quantities may involve production, purification, formulation and other problems not present in the scale of manufacturing done to date. Manufacturing drug product, such as the oral formulation of PL8177, similarly may involve production, formulation and other problems not present in manufacturing at laboratory scale.
 
 The failure of any manufacturer or supplier to comply with FDA regulations, including GMP or medical device quality systems regulations (“QSR”), or to supply the device component or drug substance and services as agreed, would force us or our licensees to seek alternative sources of supply and could interfere with our and our licensees’ ability to deliver product on a timely and cost-effective basis or at all. Establishing relationships with new manufacturers or suppliers, any of whom must be FDA-approved, is a time-consuming and costly process.
 
  Product Liability and Insurance
 
 Our business may be affected by potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our proposed products. We have liability insurance providing $10 million coverage in the aggregate as to certain clinical trial risks.

  Employees
 
 As of September 10, 2019, we employed 18 people full time, of whom 13 are engaged in research and development activities and five are engaged in administration and management, and did not have any part-time employees. While we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel, competition for personnel in our industry is intense. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. All of our employees have executed confidentiality and intellectual property agreements. We consider relations with our employees to be good.
 
 We rely on contractors and scientific consultants to work on specific research and development programs. We also rely on independent organizations, advisors and consultants to provide services, including aspects of manufacturing, testing, preclinical evaluation, clinical management, regulatory strategy and market research. Our independent advisors, contractors and consultants sign agreements that provide for confidentiality of our proprietary information and that we have the rights to any intellectual property developed while working for us.
