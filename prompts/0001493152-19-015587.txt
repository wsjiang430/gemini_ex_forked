Item 1. Business
Organizational Background
 
Java Express, Inc., was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 14, 2001, for the purpose of selling coffee and other related items to the general public from retail coffee shop locations. These endeavors ceased in 2006, and it had no material business operations from 2006 until March of 2013. On March 29, 2013, the Company, its newly formed and wholly-owned subsidiary, Anew Acquisition Corp., a Utah corporation (“Merger Sub”), and ANEW LIFE, INC., a Utah corporation (“ANEW LIFE”), executed and delivered an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into ANEW LIFE, ANEW LIFE was the surviving company under the merger and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on the closing of the merger (the “Merger”). On April 17, 2013, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to change its name from “Java Express, Inc.” to “Sundance Strategies, Inc.” Sundance Strategies, Inc. is referred to as the Company, us or we.
Our Business
 
We are currently focused on the business of purchasing residual economic interests in a portfolio of life settlements. A life settlement is the sale of an existing life insurance policy to a third party for more than the policy’s cash surrender value, but less than the face value of the policy benefit. After the sale, the new policy holder will pay the premiums due on the policy until maturity and then collect the settlement proceeds at maturity.
 
We currently do not purchase or hold life settlement or life insurance policies but, rather, previously held a contractual right to receive the net insurance benefits, or NIBs, from a portfolio of life insurance policies held by a third party. These NIBs represented an indirect, residual ownership interest in a portfolio of individual life insurance policies and they allowed us to receive a portion of the settlement proceeds from such policies, after expenses related to the acquisition, financing, insuring and servicing of the policies underlying our NIBs have been paid.
 
We were not responsible for maintaining premiums or other expenses related to maintaining the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies. Ownership of the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies, and the related obligation to maintain such policies, remains with the entity that holds such policies. However, in the event of default of the owner, the Company may choose to expend funds on premiums, interest and servicing costs to protect its interest in NIBs, though the Company has no legal responsibility nor adequate funds for these payments.
 
NIBs are generally sold by an entity that holds the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies, either directly or indirectly through a subsidiary, such an entity being referred to herein as a “Holder.” A Holder, either directly or through a wholly owned subsidiary, purchases life insurance policies either from the insured or on the secondary market and aggregates them into a portfolio of policies. At the time of purchase, the Holder also (i) contracts with a service provider to manage the servicing of the policies until maturity, (ii) consider purchasing mortality re-insurance (“MRI”) coverage under which payments will be made to the Holder in the event the insurance policies do not mature according to actuarial life expectancies, and (iii) arranges financing to cover the initial purchase of the insurance policies, the servicing of the life insurance policies until maturity and the payment of the MRI premiums. The financing obtained by the Holder for a portfolio of life settlement or life insurance policies is secured by the insurance policies for which the financing was obtained. After a Holder purchases policies, aggregates them into a portfolio and arranges for the servicing, MRI coverage and financing, the Holder contracts to sell NIBs related to the policies, which gives the holder of the NIBs the right to receive the proceeds from the settlement of the insurance policies after all of the expenses related to such policies have been paid. When an insurance policy underlying our NIBs comes to maturity, the insurance proceeds are first used to pay expenses associated with such policy. Once all of the expenses have been paid, the Holder will retain a small percentage of the proceeds and then will pay the remaining insurance proceeds to us.
 
We began purchasing NIBs during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2013.

Life Settlements Market
 
There are a number of reasons a policy owner may choose to sell his or her life insurance policy. The policy owner may no longer need or want his or her policy, he or she may wish to purchase a different kind of insurance policy, premium payments may no longer be affordable or the policy owner may need cash to fund healthcare or other expenses. In particular, policy holders 65 years of age and older and their families are faced with a variety of challenges as they seek to address their post-retirement financial needs and selling one’s life insurance policy may provide a unique and valuable financial solution to such challenges. From the early 2000s through 2008, the market for newly originated life settlements grew from virtually no activity to a peak of an estimated $12 billion of face value of U.S. life settlement policies settled annually in 2007 and 2008. Economic factors slowed the growth in 2009, when an estimated $8 billion of face value of U.S. life insurance was settled and growth has continued to decline since that time. According to a 2015 study done by the insurance research group Conning & Co., investors purchased $1.7 billion worth of U.S. life insurance face value in 2014, bringing its estimate of the total face value of life settlements held at year end to just over $32 billion. Looking ahead, however, Conning & Co. projected steady growth in the amount of face value available for life settlements, though it may take years to re-attract capital to pre-2009 levels to meet that supply. Regardless, we believe that the supply of policies has the potential to increase over time due to the aging population and increased awareness of the life settlement market as an alternative to allowing a policy to lapse for little or no value. A report from the AAP Life Settlement Market Update indicated that internal rates of return for life settlement transactions conducted in 2013 were in the high-teens. Participants in the secondary life settlement market have included major insurance companies which have purchased available pools of policies for their own investment, portfolio aggregators, private equity funds, and independent third-party investors.
Our Business Model
 
Predictability of Future Cash Flows. Predictability of future cash flows is one of the biggest challenges facing companies engaged in the life settlements industry. If a Holder is not able to adequately predict future cash flows and does not continually have enough cash to make a policy portfolio’s premium payments, the policies in the portfolio may lapse and we may lose our right to receive the proceeds from the settlement of the policies at maturity. Prediction of future cash flow requires the use of financial models, which rely on various assumptions. These assumptions include the amount and timing of projected net cash receipts, expected maturity events, counter party performance risk, changes to applicable regulation of the investment, shortage of funds needed to maintain the asset until maturity, changes in discount rates, life expectancy estimates and their relation to premiums, interest, and other costs incurred, among other items. These uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income. As a result, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. If projections of life expectancies are wrong, Holders may be obligated to service the related insurance policies for longer than expected, thereby increasing their costs and reducing the net insurance benefit available to us.
 
Financing a portion of the purchase price. Financing a portion of the purchase price of a policy portfolio allows the Holder to leverage its investment and create a larger and diversified policy portfolio. When making an investment in a portfolio of life insurance policies, a Holder utilizes actuarial tables to determine when the policies in the portfolio can be expected to come to maturity. However, the Holder assumes the risk that the policies in the portfolio will come to maturity later than was predicted by the actuarial tables used at the time of purchase. The life expectancies provided by the actuarial tables are based on actual death rates in large populations of individuals with similar demographic characteristics. Thus, the more policies underlying a policy portfolio, the more reliable the use of actuarial tables becomes. In other words, the larger the policy portfolio, the more closely the underlying insureds would be expected to, on average, follow actuarial predictions and the lower the risk associated with future cash flows will be. Because we want predictability and stability in the cash flows generated by our NIBs, we have only purchased NIBs where the Holder of the underlying policy portfolio has maximized its investment in the policy portfolios by financing a portion of the purchase price.
 
Financing premium payments. Holding NIBs where the Holder of the policy portfolio has ensured its ability to pay policy premiums by financing such premium payments and ensured the predictability of future cash flows by obtaining MRI provides us with a more stable cash position and enables us to focus on long term growth.

Mortality Re-Insurance (MRI) Coverage. Because of the uncertainty of maturity of insurance policies, the Holders had, on occassion previously contracted with an insurance provider for MRI coverage. We do not have a contract with the MRI provider and the MRI provider has not provided any insurance to us but, rather, provided MRI coverage to the various Holders of life insurance policies underlying our NIBs. MRI coverage typically provides guaranteed cash flow based on the expected death benefits of the pool of policies being insured calculated at the issuance of the coverage and thereby provides credit enhancement to any bank providing financing to a Holder. The term of the MRI policies is usually 15 years. Any claims paid by the MRI to the Holder must be paid back to the MRI provider out of death benefit proceeds from the pool of policies being insured when such death benefit proceeds are eventually received. This enables the Holder to receive a smoother cash flow from a pool of policies over time and avoid “lumpiness” in the cash flows that would otherwise be more pronounced in the absence of the MRI coverage. Any claim payment balances would accrue interest, typically at a spread of 250 basis points over LIBOR, to the extent they remain outstanding. The MRI coverage is obtained by paying an MRI premium, typically at equal to 2% of the cumulative death benefit of the covered life insurance policies, at the outset of the coverage and, depending on the specific terms of the MRI policy, possibly an additional premium amount at a predetermined time during the effective coverage period (the “Commitment Fee”), which is typically 1% of the cumulative death benefits of the covered policies. The insurer under the MRI policy typically must approve the sale of any life insurance policies covered by the MRI policy if such sale does not result in the full repayment of any outstanding recovery amounts. It is our understanding that there is only one MRI Provider. While the MRI coverage is relatively expensive, we believe that insurance policies underlying NIBs that are covered by MRI have less volatility, are more liquid and should achieve higher values for purposes of financing and secondary market sales.
 
Financing a policy portfolio’s premium payments gives a Holder additional cash needed to satisfy the premium obligations of its portfolio. In addition, obtaining MRI increases the probability that the Holder will receive future cash flows in the event the underlying insureds live longer than expected. This combination provides the Holder with sufficient liquidity to stabilize its cash position and, in turn, increases the likelihood that we will receive the NIB we have purchased related to the Holder’s portfolio.
 
Life Settlement Financing Market
 
Because of the uncertainty of maturity of life insurance policies, financing for the purchase and servicing of life insurance policies has historically been difficult to secure. The lender (the “Holders’ Lender”) has provided financing to the Holders to finance the purchase of the insurance policies underlying our NIBs. To be clear, the Holders’ Lender does not provide any financing to us but, rather, provides financing to the various Holders of life insurance policies underlying our NIBs. We have no contract, arrangement or understanding with the Holders’ Lender. The Holders’ Lender contracts with the Holders for financing to purchase the insurance policies underlying our NIBs. We believe there are few lenders within this market. The failure of the Holders’ Lender or other lenders to make loans to Holders may result in Holders’ inability to provide NIBs to us for purchase and our business model of purchasing and holding NIBs will suffer substantially. We do not have a direct contractual relationship with the Holders’ Lender.
 
The loans from the original Holders’ Lender had a term of 4 to 5 years at an interest rate between 4.5% and 8% compounded quarterly (12.1% in the event of default) and was secured by the life insurance policies owned by the Holder. During October 2017, the entities completed a refinancing of the loans that had matured. The agreements were with a new senior lending facility who previously provided MRI for the underlying policies. Between May 2018 and July 2018, the Holders entered into agreements that completed a strict foreclosure transaction that transferred the underlying life insurance policies relating to the Company’s NIBs to the lenders in full satisfaction of the loan obligation.
 
Our NIB Purchasing Guidelines
 
Our objective is to acquire NIBs based on insurance policy portfolios that will produce returns in excess of the purchase, financing, servicing and insuring costs incurred by the Holder and hold those NIBs to maturity. The guidelines we generally follow regarding the purchase of NIBs include:

● | the insured is 75 years old or older; 
--+------------------------------------------

-


● | all NIBs relate to U.S. Universal Life Insurance policies; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | all underlying insurance policies have qualified for financing that will cover at least four years of premiums following the date on which we acquire the NIBs; 
● | each policy must first be reviewed by the legal due diligence team of the lender providing financing for the acquisition and servicing of the life insurance policies, second by the MRI company’s due diligence team and then finally approved by our due diligence processes; 
● | all policies must qualify for MRI; and 
● | the projected proceeds payable on each life insurance policy upon the death of the underlying insured are projected to exceed the costs to service the life insurance policies, amounts due to creditors secured by such life insurance policy, such as the Holders’ Lender or the MRI provider, other costs and fees incurred by the Holder and the percentage of the remaining insurance benefit retained by the Holder before payment is made to us in satisfaction of our NIBs. 

Competition
 
We are not aware of any other company engaged in the business of buying NIBs. However, we encounter significant competition in the life settlements industry generally from numerous companies, including hedge funds, investment banks, secured lenders, specialty life insurance finance companies and life insurance companies themselves who purchase life settlements. Many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do and may have significantly lower cost of funds because they have greater access to insured deposits or the capital markets. Moreover, some of these competitors have significant cash reserves and can better fund shortfalls in collections that might have a more pronounced impact on companies such as ours. They also have greater market share. For example, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a portfolio of $300 million (face value) in life insurance policies in 2013. According to The Deal Pipeline, total life settlement transactions grew to $2.57 billion (face value) in 2013. In 2014 transaction volumes were reported higher by market participants in all major segments of the industry and Conning & Co. forecast an average annual gross market potential for life settlements of $180 billion from 2014-2023, with an average volume of approximately $3 billion per year in life settlement transactions.
 
A report from the AAP Life Settlement Market Update indicated that internal rates of return for life settlement transactions conducted in 2013 were in the high-teens, an attractive return at a time when fixed income and other hedge positions were delivering minimal rates of return. In the event that certain better-financed companies make a significant effort to compete against our business or the secondary market in general, prices paid for existing portfolios of life insurance policies may rise and our ability to purchase NIBs or realize a return on NIBs may decline. In addition, recent shrinking of the market for life settlements has resulted in fewer available pools of insurance policies. As a result, price competition for the remaining pools has increased. Our limited resources prohibit us from competing for larger pools. These factors could adversely affect our profitability by reducing our return on investment or increasing our risk.
 
Our Current NIB Portfolio
 
During October 2017, the Holders of the life settlements completed a refinancing of the loans that had matured. The agreements are with a new senior lending facility who previously provided MRI for the underlying policies. Between May 2018 and July 2018, the Holders entered into agreements that completed a strict foreclosure transaction that transferred the underlying life insurance policies relating to the Company’s NIBs to the lenders in full satisfaction of the loan obligation. As a result of the foreclosure, the Company has lost its position in the residual benefits of the policies and reduced the carrying value of the NIBs at March 31, 2018 to zero.
Employees
 
On March 31, 2018, we had two full-time employees: Randall F. Pearson, our President; and Lisa L. Fuller, Esq., our general legal counsel. Effective January 1, 2018, Matthew Pearson resigned his position as the Company’s Chief Operations Officer to pursue other opportunities. As of the date of this filing, no replacement has been designated to fill his position.
