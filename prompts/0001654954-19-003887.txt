  Our Business
  
 ShipTime Inc. ShipTime’s platform provides its members with the ability to quote, process, track and dispatch shipments while getting preferred rates on packages and skidded less than truckload (“LTL”) freight shipments throughout North America and around the world. In addition to these features, ShipTime also provides what it refers to as “Heroic Multilingual Customer Support.” In this capacity, ShipTime acts as an advocate on behalf of its clients in resolving matters concerning orders and shipping.  With an increasing focus and service offering for e-commerce merchants; which include online shopping carts, inventory management, payment services, client prospecting and retention software, ShipTime can help merchants worldwide grow and scale their businesses. ShipTime generates monthly recurring revenue through transactions and “software as a service” (SAAS) offerings. It currently serves in excess of 50,000 members in North America and has plans to expand its services into Europe and then worldwide.
  
 AuctionInc Software. AuctionInc is a suite of online shipping and tax management tools assisting businesses with e-commerce storefronts, shipping solutions, tax calculation, inventory management, and auction processing. The application was designed to focus on real-time carrier calculated shipping rates and tax calculations. The product does have tools to assist with other aspects of the fulfillment process, but the main purpose of the product is to provide accurate shipping and tax calculations and packaging algorithms that provide customers with the best possible shipping and tax solutions.
  
 BeerRun Software. BeerRun Software is a brewery management and Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau tax reporting software. Small craft brewers can utilize the product to manage brewery schedules, inventory, packaging, sales and purchasing. Tax reporting can be processed with a single click and is fully customizable by state or province. The software is designed to integrate with QuickBooks accounting platforms by using our powerful sync engine. We currently offer two versions of the software BeerRun and BeerRun Light which excludes some of the enhanced features of BeerRun without disrupting the core functionality of the software. Additional features include Brewpad and Kegmaster and can be added on to the base product. Craft brewing continues to grow in the United States and we feel that there is potential to grow this portion of our business.
  
  Business Strategy
  
 The Company’s focus in 2018 was to effectively execute the integration of Paid Inc. and ShipTime while ensuring that our mission; (“To provide a comprehensive e-commerce platform for global small to medium enterprises that deliver the infrastructure and the tools to allow our members to seamlessly market, transact, ship and manage their businesses to thrive in an online world”) continued to move with the velocity needed for our members to compete in today’s on-line marketplace.
  
 While the ShipTime portion of our business is now our key revenue driver; our strategy in 2018 was to continue to buildout the foundation of our e-commerce platform while driving our core business forward with double digit growth. By continuing to offer small to medium enterprises meaningful solutions and an integrated infrastructure platform we can enhance the value proposition to both our channel partners and our growing customer base allowing us to cost effectively break into new markets.
  
 In order to support the Company’s members via our strategic build-out of e-commerce services, a transition has begun to shift our Heroic Support team from an inbound support role to a combined Support and Customer Success mindset. Our Customer Success Team will be engaging with our prospects and members to provide guidance and support in utilizing new tools and services. We will be engaging our customers in new ways so they can focus on their core business and competencies. Paid will provide the infrastructure to support and assist in accelerating growth for our customers in both their existing markets and provide assistance to reach new markets as well.
  
 Our strategy for the shipping calculator clients includes upgrading the AuctionInc clients to our new Paid platform. We are increasing our product offerings to include plugins for several online shopping cart platforms. The process of augmenting our service offering to our BeerRun clients began in the 4th quarter of 2017 with a roll-out continuing throughout 2018. BeerRun continues to be a valuable component of the Company, we hope to maintain and grow our client base in the Craft Brewery industry.
  
  The business strategy described above is intended to expand our markets, increase revenue per member while enhancing our opportunities in the online e-commerce market. There are always a variety of factors that may impact our plans and inhibit our success. See “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A. Therefore, we have no guarantees and can provide no assurances, that our plans will be successful.

  Marketing and Sales
  
 The Company continues to successfully nurture and grow the relationships with our channel partners and has added new relationships that are global in scope. While much of the growth and success in 2018 was the result of the cooperative efforts of ShipTime and our channel partners with new marketing initiatives, this strategy alone will not be enough to drive our new service offerings without enhancing our marketing strategy. A foundation was mapped out in 2018 to pursue new digital marketing efforts, as well as an in-house sales team to fast forward our growth.
 
 The Company will continue to market PAID, ShipTime and BeerRun throughout 2019 and beyond. Cross selling efforts will be enhanced and new features are being added to our Paid platform. Based on experience and feedback with existing partnerships that promote our product lines, the Company believes that creating additional partnerships beyond North America is an effective marketing tool to promote and encourage new registrations. Additional resources and marketing initiatives will be utilized to increase onboarding and converting our members to being active long-time users of the Company’s services in order to accelerate our growth. 
  
  Revenue Sources
  
 In 2018, our revenues were primarily derived from our label generation services. This portion of our business has maintained consistent growth since our merger in 2016. In addition to the label generation services we continue to focus on launching our new e-commerce platforms and releasing enhancements to our brewery management software. See “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A. We have no guarantees and can provide no assurances that our plans will be successful.
 Competition
  
 Technology within the logistics industry is highly competitive and we have focused a variety of differentiators including our Heroic Customer Support™ to elevate our services beyond those of our competition. Our product offerings may also be available from other companies in our industry and we continue to emphasize value and quality customer support. The ShipTime trademark has been registered in both Canada and the United States. Our line of AuctionInc shipping calculator software is proprietary. Our intellectual property rights do not guarantee any competitive advantage and may not sufficiently protect us against competitors with similar technology. We believe that our products and other proprietary rights do not infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. However, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products or other works of ours.
  
 We also utilize free open-source technology in certain areas. Unlike proprietary software, open-source software has publicly available source code and can be copied, modified and distributed with minimal restrictions. We use open source software and technology as well to support the growing social and viral opportunities on the internet. By using 'best-of-breed' products and tools we can maximize our clients’ opportunities while minimizing our costs, which we are able to pass on to our customers.
  
 As with any software product BeerRun is not excluded from the competitive market. There are a growing number of competitors in the industry all with a unique perspective. The launch of our new offering has helped us maintain a presence in the brewery management industry. Our sales and support team stays informed with the competition and we have the ability to modify our product as the industry changes.
  
  Research and Development
  
 Over the past years the Company has made significant progress developing new integrations with e-commerce shopping cart platforms. The Company now employs several developers who are focused on the growth of the PAID brand and ShipTime products and their technologies. Our technology roadmap has been projected for the 2019 calendar year and we have enhancements scheduled for all aspects of our businesses. Our strategy includes a product redesign, new websites, e-commerce shopping cart solutions, a merchant payment processing platform, shipping calculator enhancements and many additional features and upgrades to our online shopping and shipping tools.
 Employees
  
 As of March 30, 2019, the Company currently has one part time and sixteen full time equivalent employees. We have no collective bargaining agreements and consider the relationship with our employees to be good.
