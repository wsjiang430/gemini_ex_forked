Company Description and Development of the Business
The discussion below describes the business conducted by The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, an Ohio corporation (“Scotts Miracle-Gro” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we” or “us”), including general developments in the Company’s business during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 (“fiscal 2019”).

We are the leading manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer lawn and garden products in North America. Our products are marketed under some of the most recognized brand names in the industry. Our key consumer lawn and garden brands include Scotts® and Turf Builder® lawn and grass seed products; Miracle-Gro®, Nature’s Care®, Scotts®, LiquaFeed® and Osmocote®1 gardening and landscape products; and Ortho®, Roundup®2, Home Defense® and Tomcat® branded insect control, weed control and rodent control products. We are the exclusive agent of the Monsanto Company, a subsidiary of Bayer AG since June 2018 (“Monsanto”), for the marketing and distribution of certain of Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® branded products within the United States and certain other specified countries. We have a presence in similar branded consumer products in China and Latin America. 
Through our Hawthorne segment, we are a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of nutrients, growing media, advanced indoor garden, lighting and ventilation systems and accessories for hydroponic gardening. Our key hydroponic gardening brands include General Hydroponics®, Gavita®, Botanicare®, Vermicrop®, Agrolux®, Can-Filters® and AeroGardenTM. On June 4, 2018, our Hawthorne segment acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Sunlight Supply, Inc., Sunlight Garden Supply, Inc., Sunlight Garden Supply, ULC, and IP Holdings, LLC, and all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Columbia River Industrial Holdings, LLC (collectively “Sunlight Supply”). Prior to the transaction, Sunlight Supply was the largest distributor of hydroponic products in the United States, and was engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing horticultural, organics, lighting and hydroponics products (including lighting fixtures, nutrients, seeds and growing media, systems, trays, fans, filters, humidifiers and dehumidifiers, timers, instruments, water pumps, irrigation supplies and hand tools) under key brands including Sun System®, Gro Pro®, Mother Earth®, Hurricane® and Grower’s Edge®. See “Acquisitions” for further discussion. 
Scotts Miracle-Gro traces its heritage to a company founded by O.M. Scott in Marysville, Ohio in 1868. In the mid-1900s, we became widely known for the development of quality lawn fertilizers and grass seeds that led to the creation of a new industry - consumer lawn care. In the 1990s, we significantly expanded our product offering with three powerful leading brands in the U.S. home lawn and garden industry. In fiscal 1995, through a merger with Stern’s Miracle-Gro Products, Inc., which was founded by Horace Hagedorn and Otto Stern in Long Island, New York in 1951, we acquired the Miracle-Gro® brand, the industry leader in water-soluble garden plant foods. In fiscal 1999, we acquired the Ortho® brand in the United States and obtained exclusive rights to market Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® brand within the United States and other contractually specified countries, thereby adding industry-leading weed, pest and disease control products to our portfolio. Today, Scotts®, Turf Builder®, Miracle-Gro®, Ortho® and Roundup® brands make us one of the most widely recognized companies in the consumer lawn and garden industry in the United States.

Among other things, the Third Restated Agreement amends the provisions of the Restated Marketing Agreement relating to commissions, contributions, noncompetition, and termination. The Company also performs other services on behalf of Monsanto, including manufacturing conversion services, pursuant to ancillary agreements. For additional details regarding the Third Restated Agreement, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — In the event the Third Restated Agreement for Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® products terminates or Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® business materially declines, we would lose a substantial source of future earnings and overhead expense absorption” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “NOTE 7. MARKETING AGREEMENT” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Prior to this transaction, our net investment and advances with respect to the TruGreen Joint Venture had been reduced to a liability which resulted in an amount recorded in the “Distributions in excess of investment in unconsolidated affiliate” line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of $21.9 million at September 30, 2018.

Where required, we have classified our results of operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations during the applicable periods. See “NOTE 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution
We sell our products primarily to home centers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, large hardware chains, independent hardware stores, nurseries, garden centers, e-commerce platforms, food and drug stores, indoor gardening and hydroponic product distributors, retailers and growers through both a direct sales force and our network of brokers and distributors. In addition, during fiscal 2019, we employed approximately 2,100 full-time and seasonal in-store associates within the United States to help our retail partners merchandise their lawn and garden departments directly to consumers of our products.
The majority of our shipments to customers are made via common carriers or through distributors in the United States. We primarily utilize third parties to manage the key distribution centers for our consumer business in North America, which are strategically located across the United States and Canada. Growing media products are generally shipped direct-to-store without passing through a distribution center. 
Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials for our products from various sources. We are subject to market risk as a result of the fluctuating prices of raw materials, including urea and other fertilizer inputs, resins, diesel, gasoline, natural gas, sphagnum peat, bark and grass seed. Our objectives surrounding the procurement of these materials are to ensure continuous supply, minimize costs and improve predictability. We seek to achieve these objectives through negotiation of contracts with favorable terms directly with vendors. When appropriate, we commit to purchase a certain percentage of our needs in advance of the lawn and garden season to secure pre-determined prices. We also hedge certain commodities, particularly diesel, resin and urea, to improve cost predictability and control. Sufficient raw materials were available during fiscal 2019.
Trademarks, Patents and Licenses
We consider our trademarks, patents and licenses to be key competitive advantages. We pursue a vigorous trademark protection strategy consisting of registration, renewal and maintenance of key trademarks and proactive monitoring and enforcement activities to protect against infringement. The Scotts®, Miracle-Gro®, Ortho®, Tomcat®, Hyponex®, Earthgro®, General Hydroponics®, Vermicrop®, Gavita®, Botanicare®, Agrolux®, Sun System®, Mother Earth® and Can-Filters® brand names and logos, as well as a number of product trademarks, including Turf Builder®, EZ Seed®, Organic Choice®, Nature’s Care®, Home Defense Max®, Nature Scapes®, Weed B Gon® and Roundup® for Lawns are registered in the United States and/or internationally and are considered material to our business. 
In addition, we actively develop and maintain an extensive portfolio of utility and design patents covering subject matters such as fertilizer, weed killer, chemical and growing media compositions and processes; grass seed varieties; and mechanical dispensing devices such as applicators, spreaders and sprayers. Our utility patents provide protection generally extending to 20 years from the date of filing, and many of our patents will continue well into the next decade. We also hold exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses and supply arrangements, permitting the use and sale of additional patented fertilizers, pesticides and mechanical devices. Although our portfolio of patents and patent licenses is important to our success, no single patent or group of related patents is considered significant to any of our business segments or the business as a whole.
Seasonality and Backlog
Our business is highly seasonal, with approximately 75% of our annual net sales occurring in our second and third fiscal quarters combined. Our annual sales are further concentrated in our second and third fiscal quarters by retailers who rely on our ability to deliver products closer to when consumers buy our products, thereby reducing retailers’ pre-season inventories.
We anticipate significant orders for the upcoming spring season will start to be received late in the winter and continue through the spring season. Historically, substantially all orders have been received and shipped within the same fiscal year with minimal carryover of open orders at the end of the fiscal year.
Significant Customers
Our three largest customers are Home Depot, Lowe’s and Walmart. Home Depot and Lowe’s are the only customers that individually represent more than 10% of reported consolidated net sales during any of the three most recent fiscal years. For additional details regarding significant customers, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Because of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers, the loss of one or more of, or a significant reduction in orders from, our top customers could adversely affect our financial results” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “NOTE 21. SEGMENT INFORMATION” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competitive Marketplace
The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of product innovation, product quality, product performance, value, brand strength, supply chain competency, field sales support, in-store sales support, the strength of our relationships with major retailers, distributors and advertising. 
In the lawn and garden, pest control and indoor gardening and hydroponic markets, our products compete against private-label as well as branded products. Primary competitors include Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc., Central Garden & Pet Company, Enforcer Products, Inc., Kellogg Garden Products, Oldcastle Retail, Inc., Lebanon Seaboard Corporation, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, FoxFarm Soil & Fertilizer Company, Nanolux Technology, Inc., Sun Gro Horticulture, Inc., Advanced Nutrients, Ltd. and 
Hydrofarm, LLC. In addition, we face competition from smaller regional competitors who operate in many of the areas where we compete.
In Canada, we face competition in the lawn and garden market from Premier Tech Ltd. and a variety of local companies including private label brands.
Research and Development
We continually invest in research and development, both in the laboratory and at the consumer level, to improve our products, manufacturing processes, packaging and delivery systems. Spending on research and development was $39.6 million, $42.5 million and $39.9 million in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, including product registration costs of $11.0 million, $11.4 million and $10.6 million, respectively. In addition to the benefits of our own research and development, we actively seek ways to leverage the research and development activities of our suppliers and other business partners.
Regulatory Considerations
Local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations affect the manufacture, sale, distribution and application of our products in several ways. For example, in the United States, all pesticide products must comply with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), and most require registration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “U.S. EPA”) and similar state agencies before they can be sold or distributed. Fertilizer and growing media products are subject to state and foreign labeling regulations. In addition to the regulations already described, federal, state and foreign agencies regulate the disposal, transport, handling and storage of waste, remediation of contaminated sites, air and water discharges from our facilities, and workplace health and safety. Our grass seed products are regulated by the Federal Seed Act and various state regulations. 
In addition, the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local, state, federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations (such as “not for use on sod farms or golf courses”), may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients or categories of products altogether.
State, federal and foreign authorities generally require growing media facilities to obtain permits (sometimes on an annual basis) in order to harvest peat and to discharge storm water run-off or water pumped from peat deposits. The permits typically specify the condition in which the property must be left after the peat is fully harvested, with the residual use typically being natural wetland habitats combined with open water areas. We are generally required by these permits to limit our harvesting and to restore the property consistent with the intended residual use. In some locations, these facilities have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water.
For more information regarding how compliance with local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations may affect us, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Compliance with environmental and other public health regulations or changes in such regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could increase our costs of doing business or limit our ability to market all of our products” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to various environmental proceedings, the majority of which are for site remediation. At September 30, 2019, $3.9 million was accrued for such environmental matters. During fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, we expensed $1.4 million, $1.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, for such environmental matters. We had no material capital expenditures during the last three fiscal years related to environmental or regulatory matters.
Employees
As of September 30, 2019, we employed approximately 5,600 employees. During peak sales and production periods, we employed approximately 6,100 employees, including seasonal and temporary labor.
