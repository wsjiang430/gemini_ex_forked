Item 1. Business
Overview
Thoughtworks Holding, Inc. ("Thoughtworks," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a premium global technology consultancy that integrates strategy, design and software engineering to enable enterprises and technology disruptors across the globe to thrive as modern digital businesses. Thoughtworks exists to deliver extraordinary impact for clients, employees, partners and the communities we serve through our culture and technology excellence.
In the face of ongoing digital disruption, many companies lack the capabilities and talent necessary to keep pace with the accelerating rate of technological change. Thoughtworks has been a thought leader at the forefront of technology innovation for the past 29 years. We leverage our vast experience to improve our clients’ ability to flourish in the digital era. 
We are a globally diversified business, with clients across all major verticals and geographies. Our global distributed agile delivery model operates where our clients are, with over 12,500 employees working across 18 countries on five continents, including North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Further, our unique, diverse and cultivating culture, with a reputation for technology excellence and thought leadership, enables us to attract and retain what we believe is the best talent in the industry. That is why our clients trust Thoughtworks as their premium digital transformation partner.
Global spending on digital transformation is forecast by International Data Corporation ("IDC") to reach $3.4 trillion in 2026.
Thoughtworks provides premium, end-to-end digital strategy, design and engineering services and we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. We connect strategy to execution, using cross-functional teams to deliver value to our clients at scale. Our four global service lines provide specialized capabilities and thought leadership to drive digital transformation:
•Enterprise Modernization, Platforms & Cloud
•Customer Experience, Product & Design
•Data & Artificial Intelligence ("AI")
•Digital Transformation & Operations
Our unique service offerings, differentiated delivery, global talent and culture have enabled us to attract over 410 current clients, including global enterprises and technology disruptors. Our clients are highly diversified across industry verticals. We have relatively low client concentration, with only 24.7% of our revenues coming from our top 10 clients in 2022. Our deep client integration and senior executive relationships have enabled us to drive long-standing partnerships with our clients, as demonstrated by an average tenure of nine years across our top 10 clients by revenue in 2022. As a result, 87.2% of our revenues in 2022 were generated from existing clients.
Since our inception, we have been pioneers in technologies that now underpin today's modern digital businesses, such as agile software development, continuous delivery, microservices, evolutionary architecture and data mesh. We have established ourselves as a thought leader and are continually advancing digital trends with our innovations. We believe our approach enables us to deliver the innovations that deliver value for our clients before new technologies reach mass adoption.
We utilize a distributed agile delivery model, leveraging a broad base of high-quality, poly-skilled global technology talent. Our professionals seamlessly work with clients both where they are located and nearshore/offshore. Our local presence enables us to develop deep client intimacy and assimilate market context and knowledge. Blending our local presence with our nearshore/offshore capabilities allows us to innovate rapidly at scale. Our differentiated delivery model enables us to generate an average annual revenue per employee of over $100,000 in each of 2020, 2021 and 2022 (based on the average number of employees for the relevant year). For more information regarding our average annual revenue per employee in historical periods, see 
"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Performance—Expanding our technical capabilities and client solutions."
Our differentiated approach is rooted in a unique culture that is championed by our global management team, which has an average tenure of 16 years. Our reputation for technology excellence, thought leadership and advocacy for social change enables us to attract what we believe is the best talent in the industry. Allied to this, our cultivating culture enables us to develop and retain talent. In addition, Thoughtworks is widely recognized for leading the technology industry through our efforts on diversity and inclusion. For example, 40% of our global management team are women or underrepresented gender minorities ("WUGM"). Thoughtworkers are incredibly engaged and loyal, as evidenced by our 2022 annual employee engagement survey, where our overall engagement remained consistent with 2021 at 8.7 which is in the top 25% for the technology sector. Our diversity and inclusion score increased to 9.0 which puts Thoughtworks in the top 5% in the sector. Our attrition rate of 12.0% for 2022 is lower than the industry average.
We believe the Thoughtworks value proposition is sustainable and difficult to replicate. The core elements form a virtuous cycle: clients trust us to deliver on their most complex and business-critical projects; those experiences allow us to explore cutting-edge technologies and expand our thought leadership; this enables us to continuously attract, develop and retain the very best global talent; which gives us the ability to meet and exceed our clients’ needs. Our position is at the forefront of successive waves of technological change — spotting important trends early.
Our approach has enabled us to consistently grow our revenues and profits. In 2022, we reported revenues of approximately $1.3 billion, representing 21.1% year-over-year growth. Net loss for the full year was $(105.4) million compared to $(0.6) million in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $256.8 million representing year-over-year growth of 15.0%. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for a definition of and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, how we use Adjusted EBITDA and an explanation of why we consider this non-GAAP measure to be helpful for investors.

Our Growth Strategies
We continue to differentiate ourselves as a leading global technology consultancy that drives digital innovation by leveraging the following key growth strategies:
•Deepen our relationships with existing clients. We have a successful track record of expanding our relationships with our existing clients. This is reflected in our total percentage of revenues from existing clients, which represented 87.2% in 2022. In addition, in 2022, we had 32 clients generating between $5 million and $10 million in revenues and 35 clients generating over $10 million. We intend to focus on larger, higher value projects. We believe we have a substantial opportunity to cross-sell additional services to our existing clients.
•Establish new client relationships. We believe there are significant untapped opportunities to win new clients across current and adjacent industry verticals and geographies. To that end, we increased the total number of clients to 416 in 2022 from 371 in 2021. Adding new clients has also enabled us to maintain relatively low client concentration with only 15.4% and 24.7% of our revenues coming from our top five and 10 clients, respectively, in 2022.
•Develop new technical capabilities and client solutions. For 29 years, we have been at the forefront of innovation, pioneering numerous innovative trends. We have built a thought leadership engine that we believe is consistently pioneering technology-driven business change. We accomplish this by giving our teams, who work in close proximity to our clients, autonomy to experiment with new technologies while solving complex client problems. When they discover new innovations, we give them resources to develop and harvest them, then scale them through our global delivery model.
•Develop and grow our strategic partnerships. While we remain technologically agnostic and work with the appropriate technologies for our clients, we have expanded our relationships with hyperscale cloud providers, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Alibaba. This enables us to deepen our capabilities, target new clients and drive meaningful growth. We partner with other third-party product and service companies to expand our delivery capabilities as well as identify additional client opportunities.
•Pursue strategic, targeted acquisitions. Our historic growth has been predominantly organic and we expect this to continue. In 2022, we made two strategic acquisitions: (i) Handmade in Brazil to bolster and enhance our customer experience, product and design service line and (ii) Connected in Canada to advance our capabilities in solving business problems through product-led design processes, from defining the strategy to discovery and delivery. Going forward, we believe there is further opportunity to augment our growth by selectively pursuing acquisitions that broaden our service offerings, add leading talent, expand our client base and addressable market and enhance the depth of our capabilities in all of our verticals and geographies.
•Focused-geographic expansion. Thoughtworks has throughout its history expanded into key new countries, for instance we opened an office in Vietnam in 2022, and intend to continue to do so, as and when opportunities to do so make strategic sense.
Thoughtworks' Differentiation
Thoughtworks was founded in Chicago in 1993 by a small team with a unified purpose. At that time, information technology functions were largely regarded as ineffective cost centers. As a digital native business, Thoughtworks aspired to change this through experimenting and learning to drive continuous improvement and the pursuit of excellence in the craft of software development.
Today, we believe our clients benefit from our differentiation, including our:
•Ability to digitally transform global enterprises at scale by applying strategic consulting and cutting edge technologies. Digital transformation requires alignment across the entire organization. Thoughtworks' unique and consistent global approach and end-to-end capabilities span strategy, design, software engineering and organizational transformation. We believe that is why we can enable 
clients to realize value swiftly, and why our clients rely on Thoughtworks to solve their most complex problems.
•Deep agile and technical expertise coupled with a history of thought leadership. Thoughtworks was an early visionary behind some of today’s leading technologies, as reflected by our range of publications, including approximately 100 software engineering and technology books Thoughtworkers have collectively authored. We have been delivering software and subsequently digital transformation, in an agile manner for over 20 years, long before it was a mainstream practice.
•Poly-skilled, transformational and global talent. We believe we deliver transformational change to our clients through our differentiated and diversified talent base of over 12,500 Thoughtworkers. To achieve that, we hire poly-skilled, high-aptitude Thoughtworkers who can learn new skills quickly. We see this as a competitive advantage in the talent market.
•Global and distributed agile delivery with a strong local presence. We use highly skilled, distributed teams to deliver custom software projects more effectively and to give our over 410 clients access to the diverse talent they need. Our global delivery ensures our ability to meet our clients’ global demands, while our local presence provides us with specialized knowledge of the local market and culture, enabling us to work side-by-side with our clients in their time zones and languages on innovative and effective solutions.
•Award-winning and cultivating culture. Since our founding, we have relentlessly focused on evolving our culture, creating a differentiated brand that Thoughtworkers are proud to be a part of. We believe our culture not only drives higher quality work but also enables us to efficiently recruit and retain Thoughtworkers to drive growth.
•Experienced management team with a long history of working together. Our global management team has an average tenure of 16 years at Thoughtworks and the majority have been working together as a team for over a decade. Most of the team members have worked across multiple functions and geographies, giving the group a diverse and well-rounded experience-base on all facets of our business.
As a result of our competitive advantages, we have created a virtuous cycle that is difficult to replicate. We earn our clients’ trust to deliver on their most complex and business-critical projects. Our demonstrated track record of success encourages us to further develop cutting-edge technology solutions and expand our thought leadership. As a result, we continuously attract, develop and retain high caliber talent, enabling us to meet and exceed our clients’ needs. The reputation we have built as the go-to partner for digital transformation allows us to command premium bill rates.
Our Culture & People
Since inception, revolutionizing the technology industry has been a core part of Thoughtworks’ mission. We are driven by a desire to “create an extraordinary impact on the world through our culture and technology excellence.” Our people relentlessly pursue our values of integrity, excellence, global-first, cultivation, curiosity, autonomy, inclusivity and courage. We aim to be an awesome partner for clients and their ambitions.
Diversity & Inclusion
Thoughtworks proudly and actively seeks to make itself and the technology industry more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve. We believe that our culture encourages discourse and collaboration at all levels, as evidenced by our 2022 employee engagement survey: we scored 8.7 as an aggregated average across Thoughtworks.
Diversity and inclusion has been a core guiding principle since we were founded. As of December 31, 2022, 40% of our global management team and approximately 40.4% of our technologists identify as WUGM.
Our Recognition
Our differentiated culture has been widely recognized by the industry, earning us numerous awards, including:
•Thirteen of Thoughtworks’ countries now have the Great Place to Work certification. We are proud that we have achieved industry-leading Great Place to Work trust index scores, with a global average of 91%.
•In Q4 2022, our overall global Glassdoor rating is 4.47, higher than the Glassdoor rating for the IT services sector of 3.95.
Attracting Talent
Our employee brand is strong in the market and in 2022, we had approximately 225,000 applications for roles. Our recruitment capability is a source of key differentiation, with 99.99% of all hires being recruited internally through our recruitment and recruitment marketing teams on a 30/30/30 model — with a goal of 30% referrals, 30% direct applicants and 30% sourced, with the help of channels like Access Thoughtworks, our online community for career development and job opportunities.
Thoughtworkers come from a variety of traditional and non-traditional technology backgrounds and include career changers and/or self-taught technologists, valuing transferable skills, adaptability and continuous learning. Our blended delivery approach gives us a clear advantage when it comes to attracting talent. Candidates have the opportunity to work on in-region service line projects, as well as in distributed agile teams — either as part of a nearshore or far-shore delivery team. We believe candidates are attracted by our career development opportunities. We continue to innovate in our recruitment and onboarding processes and tools.
Training Talent
As a pioneer of agile and extreme programming practices, in 2005 we set up Thoughtworks University, our immersive entry-level program for new hires. This provides guidance on career coaching and progression, ensuring our newest Thoughtworkers have the full toolset required for them to build long-term careers at Thoughtworks. As of December 2022, there have been approximately 4,100 graduates from Thoughtworks University since its inception, including 62% WUGM in 2022.
Retaining Talent
Cultivation and empowerment is a core part of our culture; we call this "Empowering Thoughtworker Growth"—enabling Thoughtworkers to have a personalized, integrated journey of cultivation and growth. We developed tools, including "Pathways" for career planning and growth paths and "Summit" for self-assessment, expectation-setting and feedback, as well as offering Thoughtworkers extensive online training opportunities.
When we became a public company in September 2021, every Thoughtworker with us at that time became an equityholder. Going forward, we can offer equity as part of the total reward package to a broad set of our people. This approach aligns with our inclusive culture and proactive approach to employee retention.
Our Differentiated Service Offerings
We are passionate about creating exceptional customer experiences and helping clients achieve their unique business goals. As our clients continuously evolve and grow their modern digital business capabilities, they capitalize on our end-to-end services that combine strategy, innovative experience design and world-class software engineering.

Our Global Distributed Agile Delivery Model
Thoughtworks is a global business, operating as a single organization, with consistent global capabilities, regardless of country. We have a broad geographical presence with proven capabilities in key regions. As of December 31, 2022, we have 9.6% of our employees in North America, 14.3% in Europe, 15.5% in Latin America ("LATAM") and 60.6% in Asia-Pacific ("APAC").
Our blended delivery model means we are able to partner with our clients in ways that suit them. By offering a combination of onshore and nearshore/offshore talent, we are able to deliver the services our clients need, while balancing costs and proximity considerations.
Our Clients
During 2022, we served over 410 clients ranging from large, global enterprises to technology disruptors, who utilized our services and talent to help them evolve the digital capabilities within their organizations. We have a diversified client base spanning a range of geographies and industry verticals. In 2022, our revenues as a percentage of total revenues were as follows across geographies: 38.9% North America; 32.4% APAC; 24.4% Europe; and 4.3% LATAM. In addition, in 2022, our revenues as a percentage of total revenues were as follows across industry verticals: 27.8% technology and business services; 24.4% energy, public and health services; 18.3% retail and consumer; 17.1% financial services and insurance; and 12.4% automotive, travel and transportation. Additionally, our top five and 10 clients in 2022 represented just 15.4% and 24.7%, respectively, of our revenues.
We have long-term and trusted relationships with our clients. In 2022, 87.2% of our revenues came from existing clients and our 10 largest clients in 2022 have been clients with us for an average of nine years. We look to partner with clients who recognize the importance of technology as a central component of their business strategy. With that shared understanding, we engrain ourselves in their organizations and collaborate with them to translate that strategy into higher business value over the long term.
Key Challenges Our Clients are Facing
As much as digital transformation is considered an imperative, companies face several key challenges in their digital transformation journeys, including the ability to:
•Keep up with the latest technological innovations. Often companies lack the ability to synthesize and prioritize the latest technology to drive value and to compete.
•Embrace digital to drive sustainable change across the enterprise. Often, companies are unable to align key functional stakeholders on competing priorities between business and technology.
•Deliver digital products and experiences rapidly and at scale. Many organizations struggle to adapt to the pace of change required to thrive in a digital marketplace.
•Adopt platform thinking. To benefit fully from digital platforms requires significant investments and, often, cultural changes.
•Recruit and retain high-quality talent. Competition for digital talent is fierce.
Sales & Marketing
Our sales and marketing strategy is focused on increasing revenues from existing clients, generating revenues from new clients and continuing to maintain our brand to appeal to current and prospective clients and employees.
Sales
Our sales strategy emphasizes a team-based approach involving client partners, account managers, delivery professionals, country heads and senior leaders. We have created a three-prong model for our demand teams. One group targets new client acquisition, a second looks after existing clients and the third builds on growing our partner business.
In 2022, we invested in our outbound demand generation capacity, increasing our ability to win new business.
Excellence in Client Services Initiative
Our approach to client relationships is based on the understanding that technology and delivery are as important as sales. Each of our clients has a Client Leadership Team (“CLT”), whose mission is to drive success for the client’s business. The CLT consists of three senior leaders. They are supported by the Excellence in Client Services program, which enables the CLTs to execute strategic change with their clients through masterclasses, workshops and tools. This has been an effective model for us, allowing us to stay close to not only the client but also the work we deliver and how we deliver it.
Marketing
Our reputation as a leading digital transformation services provider helps us generate new business opportunities. In addition to the flagship Thoughtworks Technology Radar, we have a portfolio of high impact publications such as our annual Looking Glass report, as well as thought leadership events, such as XConf, a global event series focused on the latest thinking from Thoughtworks’ technology community. 
The investment in our Digital Experience Platform—including the implementation of a new customer relationship management system and migration to a new content management system—has strengthened our ability to reach and influence our target business executive audience, support account growth with personalized account-based marketing and collate real-time insights to inform our go-to-market strategy.
Our focus on building our premium brand has resulted in Thoughtworks being ranked as a Brand Finance top 25 global IT services brand.
Revolutionizing the Technology Industry
Alongside our commitment to diversity and inclusion in the technology industry, Thoughtworks has been at the forefront of revolutionizing the technology industry and thought leadership and authorship are part of our DNA.
Books
Thoughtworkers have published approximately 100 books on a wide variety of topics, cementing Thoughtworks’ industry-leading ideas around distributed agile, lean thinking, microservices and evolutionary architecture. Through nurturing talent and supporting would-be authors, Thoughtworks has established a reputation as an attractive place to work for top talent.
Thoughtworks Technology Radar and Thoughtworks Looking Glass
Published twice a year over the past 13 years and now in its 27th edition, Thoughtworks Technology Radar has become the go-to guide for software developers. It helps technologists keep up with the rapid innovation and the ever-evolving technology landscape. The publication received endorsements from Porsche, Redgate and REA Group.
Thoughtworks Looking Glass is our annual report into the day’s most important technology trends. It gives business executives advice on how advances in technology will impact their organization and how quickly they need to react.
Open Source
Thoughtworks has always been an ardent supporter of open source software. This support stems from a philosophical perspective on how the best software is created and from a practical perspective, in that many of the software tools and products we have developed have been created through the use of open source licenses; many Thoughtworkers are dedicated contributors to a wide variety of open source projects.
We believe that open source enables us to build superior solutions to those based on proprietary software in terms of cost, freedom, privacy, security, quality and community. Building open source software allows us to share new ways of working and learn from the wider community.
Environment and Social Impact
Environment
Thoughtworks is passionate about sustainability and the environment, and has a long-standing commitment to creating positive social change through our technology contributions. This includes in May 2021, co-founding the Green Software Foundation, along with Microsoft, GitHub, Accenture and the Linux Foundation, which seeks to build a trusted ecosystem for green software. In 2019, Thoughtworks committed to set near-term company-wide emission reductions targets for which we are currently coordinating validation from the Science Based Targets initiative ("SBTi").
Social Impact
Diversity and inclusion has been a guiding principle since we were founded as evidenced by our 2022 employee engagement survey: Our diversity and inclusion score increased to 9.0 which, according to Peakon surveys, puts Thoughtworks in the top 5% in the sector. As of December 31, 2022, 42.8% of Thoughtworkers globally were WUGM.
We work with communities around the world on over 70 initiatives, and strive to make significant contributions to the United Nations ("U.N.") Sustainable development goals ("SDGs"), particularly goals three (good health and well-being), five (gender equality), nine (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 10 (reduced inequalities) and 13 (climate action). We believe that our social impact ethic is a key pillar of our culture and business and is considered a board-level priority. Thoughtworkers seek to undertake transformational social impact projects around the world. An example of this is the work we do in support of the Digital Public Goods Alliance, whose mission is to promote digital public goods to create a more equitable world. In 2022, Thoughtworks joined the United Nations Global Compact. We believe the ten UN Global Compact principles are reflected in our company purpose and we intend to make incorporating these principles into our strategies, policies and procedures a board-level priority.
Our Industry
Modern, next-generation technologies have spawned a digital revolution, advancing the global economy towards a digital age driven by seamless connectivity, efficient cloud computing and advanced data analytics. This is redefining business models, disrupting the competitive landscape and increasing consumer expectations. To survive and enable growth, companies across all industries and geographies need to adapt to the accelerated pace of technological change by undergoing holistic and continuous digital transformations.
Key Technology Industry Trends Driving Digital Transformation
A number of key industry trends are driving spending for digital transformation:
•Platforms as products: Delivering value through customer focus. To be truly effective and transformative, platforms must be designed and delivered with a relentless commitment to end-user value.
•Hostile tech: Confronting challenges in security, ethics and privacy. Successful innovation requires a strong commitment to mitigating the potential risks of new technologies.
•Partnering with AI: Making machine intelligence mainstream. Businesses must consider where and how to embed machine learning capabilities, ensuring a tangible impact.
•Making the metaverse: Exploring the frontiers of digital interaction. Emerging technologies, such as extended and augmented reality, are enabling new forms of connection inside organizations and across the wider economy.
•Evaluating Web3: Navigating the internet’s possible futures. The future of the internet is still taking shape; leaders must make smart and informed choices about their participation.
•Accelerating sustainability: Responding to the climate crisis with technology. Technology is not only an important area for sustainable transformation, it can also help drive it.
Our Market Opportunity
As companies struggle to keep pace with this accelerating rate of technological innovation, they need to rely on service providers to drive digital transformation, creating a massive market opportunity. According to IDC, global spending on digital transformation is forecast to reach $3.4 trillion in 2026.
Competition
We operate in a global, dynamic and rapidly evolving market and, as a result, face competition from a wide number of organizations and service providers, both global as well as local. These include software engineering specialists, large global consulting firms, strategic consulting firms, traditional IT services providers and our clients’ in-house development teams.
We believe that our thought leadership, excellence in modern software engineering capabilities, end-to-end solutions that we are able to deliver to our clients rapidly and at scale, differentiated global delivery model and unique culture with a focus on diversity and inclusion provide us with strong, sustained differentiation from our competition.
Limitations of Other Digital Service Providers
While the market for digital transformation services is large and growing rapidly with a range of quality providers, many face some key limitations, including:
•Inability to deliver new technological innovations ahead of mass adoption. Many service providers offer expertise around digital innovations only after such innovations reach mass adoption. As a result, they struggle to innovate and adopt newer technologies earlier to differentiate their clients’ digital products and experiences.
•Lack of expertise to provide early stage strategy for complex digital transformations. Many service providers are optimized to execute once a template for scaling is designed, but often lack early stage strategy expertise. If technology expertise is absent from strategic decision-making, then the resulting solution may be ineffective or undifferentiated.
•Employees focused on narrower specialties. Many service providers train their employees in narrower specialties, resulting in both siloed development and solutions. By taking this approach, employees often lack the full context needed to identify potential problems and opportunities, limiting the speed and depth of innovation.
•Limited onshore talent. Many service providers have a high concentration of employees offshore, but offer limited onshore talent. As a result, they may lack important local market context, client intimacy to 
drive innovation and the ability to influence culture, transfer knowledge and enable sustained organizational change.
•Concentration of talent in fewer offshore geographies. Many service providers rely on a limited number of international geographies to recruit their offshore talent. As a result, they may miss out on broader pools of high-quality talent to support demand and are unable to consistently provide talent in the client’s preferred location.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property rights are important to our business, particularly around our branding. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and unfair competition laws, as well as intellectual property assignment and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights. We require our employees, independent contractors, vendors and clients to enter into written confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us be kept confidential.
We customarily enter into non-disclosure agreements with our clients with respect to the use of their software systems and platforms. Our clients usually own the intellectual property in the software or systems we develop for them. Furthermore, we usually grant a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, transferable and non-revocable license to our clients to use our pre-existing intellectual property but only to the extent necessary to use the software or systems we developed for them.
We have invested and plan to continue to invest in research and development to enhance our domain knowledge and create complex, specialized solutions for our clients. We have registered (or applied for registration of) the trademark “Thoughtworks” in over fifteen jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom, as of December 31, 2022. We have developed several tools, including consulting frameworks and software applications, that we use to deliver digital services to our clients. We have also secured patent protection for certain internal asset tracking and human machine interaction designs. In addition, to ensure we maintain the ability to engage with our clients, employees and the public, we have registered and maintained dozens of domain names.
We do not believe that any individual intellectual property right, other than our rights in our name and logo, is material to our business.
Government Regulations
Due to the industry and geographic diversity of our operations and services, our operations are subject to a variety of rules and regulations. Several foreign and U.S. federal and state agencies regulate various aspects of our business. We are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we operate, including export-import restriction and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, anti-corruption laws, and privacy laws and regulations like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA") and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), among others. Compliance with these laws requires significant resources and non-compliance may result in civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures.
