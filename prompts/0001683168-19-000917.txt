Our Products
 
Original Content
 
We own and produce original content that is meant to entertain and enrich toddlers to tweens as well as families. It is generally a three-year cycle from the inception of an idea, through production of the content and development and distribution of a range of consumer products to retail, creating an inevitable lag time between the creation of the intellectual property to the realization of economic benefit of those assets. Our goal is to maintain a robust and diverse portfolio of brands, appealing to various interests and ages, featuring evergreen topics with global appeal. Our portfolio of intellectual property can be licensed, re-licensed, and exploited for years to come, with revenue derived from multiple sources and territories. Our portfolio of original content includes:

Licensed Content
 
In addition to the wholly-owned or partially-owned properties listed above, we represent Llama Llama in the licensing and merchandising space.
 
Genius Brands Network
 
Seeing a need for a destination devoted to providing "Content with a Purpose," we launched the Genius Brands Network comprised of the Kid Genius Cartoon Network and Baby Genius TV. The network is distributed across multiple platforms including advertising supported video-on-demand (“AVOD”), subscription video-on-demand (“SVOD”) and over-the-top platforms (“OTT”) providing kids and parents a clear choice in premium entertaining, enriching and engaging programming.
 
The Kid Genius Cartoon Network provides smart TV for kids. Our shows are designed for kids to tweens and anyone in between. Our Kid Genius Cartoon Network exposes kids to new and intriguing subjects that stimulate their senses and imagination on a daily basis. Parents will enjoy watching their kids be entertained with enriching and educational series. Featured series include Dino Squad, Thomas Edison's Secret Lab, Inspector Gadget and more.

Distribution
 
Content
 
Today’s global marketplace and the manner in which content is consumed has evolved to a point where we believe there is only one viable strategy, ubiquity. Kids today expect to be able to watch what they want whenever they want and wherever they want. As such, content creators now must offer direct access on multiple fronts. This includes not only linear broadcast but also digital platforms. We have strong ties to and actively solicit placement for our content from the largest linear broadcasters such as Nickelodeon, The Disney Channel, Cartoon Network, Sprout, and PBS. Similarly, on the digital side, we are partnered with Comcast’s Xfinity platform as well as AppleTV, Roku, Samsung TV, Amazon Fire, Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube, Cox, Dish, Sling and Zumo as well as Connected TV. We replicate this model of ubiquity around the world defining content distribution strategies by market that blends the best of linear, VOD, and digital distribution.
 
Finally, we expanded our long-term strategic partnership with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment from domestic to global in January 2017. On August 31, 2018 Sony Pictures Home Entertainment assigned all of its rights and interest in our programs to Alliance Entertainment, LLC (“AEC”).
 
Consumer Products
 
A source of our revenue is our licensing and merchandising activities from our underlying intellectual property content. We work directly in licensing properties to a variety of manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. We currently have across all brands in excess of 49 licensees and hundreds of licensed products scheduled to enter the market. Products bearing our marks can be found in a wide variety of retail distribution outlets reaching consumers in retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target, Barnes & Noble, The Home Depot, Old Navy, Amazon.com and many more. We often negotiate dedicated retail space on a direct basis with retailers that will include branded signage to give our brands prominence and clear communication with the consumer. License agreements that we enter into often include financial guarantees and commitments from the manufacturers guaranteeing a minimum stream of revenue for us. As licensed merchandise is sold at retail, these advances and/or minimum guarantees can earn out at which point we could earn additional revenue.

Marketing
 
We believe that generating awareness and consumer interest in our brands requires a 360-degree approach to marketing. Beyond the content creation and distribution, consumers must become engaged with the content in all aspects of their lives. Successful marketing campaigns for our brands have included utilizing influencers (individuals with a strong, existing social media presence who drive awareness of our brands to their followers), social media marketing, and participating in cross promotional consumer product campaigns. We deploy digital and print advertising to support the brands as well as work with external media relations professionals to promote our efforts to both consumer and trade. We regularly initiate grass roots marketing campaigns and strategic partnerships with brands that align and offer value to us. Our Genius Brands Network, with distribution in over 80 million households, provides reach for cross promotion of content and consumer products.
Competition
 
We compete against other creators of children’s content including Disney, Nickelodeon, PBS Kids, and Sesame Street as well as other small and large creators. In the crowded children’s entertainment space, we compete with these other creators for both content distribution across linear, VOD, and digital platforms as well as retail shelf space for our licensed products. To compete, we are focused on our strategic positioning of “content with a purpose” which we believe is a point of differentiation embraced by the industry, as well as parents and educators. Additionally, the Kid Genius Cartoon Network, Baby Genius TV, and Kid Genius Cartoon Channel Plus enables us to increase the awareness of our brands through an owned platform.
Customers and Licensees
 
Typically, our business is not reliant on one or a few major customers; however, in 2018 one customer accounted for 20% of our revenue. In 2017, over 80% of our revenue was attributable to the recognition of revenues earned from Netflix upon the delivery of the first season of Llama Llama. As of December 31, 2018, we had partnered with over 60 consumer products licensees going to market with nearly 300 stock keeping units (“SKU”). As of the same date, we licensed our content to over 40 broadcasters in over 90 territories globally as well as a number of VOD and online platforms that have a global reach. This broad cross-section of customers includes companies such as Comcast, Netflix, Sony, YouTube, Mattel, Target, Penguin Publishing, Manhattan Toys, Roku, Apple TV, Amazon, Google, Bertelsmann Music Group, Discovery International, and others both domestically and internationally.
Government Regulation
 
The FCC requires broadcast networks to air a required number of hours of Educational and Informational content (E/I). We are subject to online distribution regulations, namely the FTC’s Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) which regulates the collection of information of children younger than 13 years old.
 
We are currently subject to regulations applicable to businesses generally, including numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, enforcement and advertising of credit accounts, and limitations on the maximum amount of finance charges that may be charged by a credit provider. Although credit to some of our customers is provided by third parties without recourse to us based upon a customer’s failure to pay, any restrictive change in the regulation of credit, including the imposition of, or changes in, interest rate ceilings, could adversely affect the cost or availability of credit to our customers and, consequently, our results of operations or financial condition.
 
Licensed toy products are subject to regulation under the Consumer Product Safety Act and regulations issued thereunder. These laws authorize the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) to protect the public from products which present a substantial risk of injury. The CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall such products. The CPSC may also impose fines or penalties on manufacturers or retailers. Similar laws exist in some states and other countries in which we plan to market our products. Although we do not manufacture and may not directly distribute toy products, a recall of any of the products may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We also maintain websites which include our corporate website located at www.gnusbrands.com, as well as www.spacepopgirls.com, www.kidgeniustv.com, www.babygenius.com, www.smckids.com, www.slam7.com, and www.edisonsecretlab.com. These websites are subject to laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet communications and commerce, which is a currently developing area of the law. The United States has enacted Internet laws related to children’s privacy, copyrights and taxation. However, laws governing the Internet remain largely unsettled. The growth of the market for Internet commerce may result in more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad, that place additional burdens on companies conducting business over the Internet. We cannot predict with certainty what impact such laws will have on our business in the future.  In order to comply with new or existing laws regulating Internet commerce, we may need to modify the manner in which we conduct our website business, which may result in additional expense.
 
Because our products are manufactured by third parties and licensees, we are not significantly impacted by federal, state and local environmental laws and do not have significant costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations.
