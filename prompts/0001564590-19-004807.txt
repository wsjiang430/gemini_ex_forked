ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
MGM Resorts International is referred to as the “Company,” “MGM Resorts,” or the “Registrant,” and together with its subsidiaries may also be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” MGM China Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as “MGM China.” Except where the context indicates otherwise, “MGP” refers to MGM Growth Properties LLC together with its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Overview 
 
MGM Resorts International is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1986 that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, owns and operates integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts across the United States and in Macau.
 
MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company which completed its initial public offering in April 2016, is organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an UPREIT) structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by and substantially all of its businesses are conducted through MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”). Pursuant to a master lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company (the “tenant”) and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the “landlord”), the tenant leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM (which was branded as Monte Carlo prior to May 2018), Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, and MGM National Harbor from the landlord. See Note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding MGP and the Operating Partnership, which we consolidate in our financial statements, and Note 17 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the master lease with MGP.
 
We believe we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. We make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. Ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests. 
 
Business Developments
 
In August 2016, we completed the acquisition of Boyd Gaming Corporation’s (“Boyd Gaming”) ownership interest in Borgata, at which time Borgata became a consolidated subsidiary of ours. Subsequently, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from us.  In December 2016, we opened MGM National Harbor and, in October 2017, MGP also acquired the long-term leasehold interest and real property associated with MGM National Harbor from us.
 
In February 2018, we opened MGM Cotai, an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip in Macau, and in August 2018, we opened MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts. 
 
In July 2018, MGP completed its previously announced acquisition of the membership interests of Northfield Park Associates, LLC (“Northfield”), an Ohio limited liability company that owns the real estate assets and operations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park from Milstein Entertainment LLC for a purchase price of approximately $1.1 billion (“Northfield Acquisition”). Simultaneously with the close of the transaction, MGP entered into a new agreement with an affiliate of Hard Rock Café International (STP), Inc. to continue to serve as the manager of the property. 
 
In September 2018, we entered into an agreement with MGP to acquire all of the operating assets of Northfield (“Northfield OpCo”) from MGP for approximately $275 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Northfield will be added to the existing master lease between us and MGP. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions.
 
In December 2018, we entered into an agreement with MGP whereby MGP will pay us consideration of approximately $638 million for renovations undertaken by us regarding the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas property (the “Park MGM Lease Transaction”). Additionally, at closing, the parties will enter into an amendment to the existing master lease. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019 and is subject to customary closing conditions. 
 
In January 2019, we completed our previously announced acquisition of the real property and operations associated with Empire City Casino's race track and casino ("Empire City") for consideration of approximately $864 million, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments. Subsequently, MGP acquired Empire City’s real property from us for fair value of consideration of 
 1


approximately $634 million. In connection with this transaction, we entered into an amendment to the existing master lease for our subsidiary to lease back the real estate assets of Empire City from the landlord. In addition, pursuant to the master lease amendment, we agreed to provide MGP a right of first offer with respect to certain undeveloped land adjacent to the property to the extent that we develop additional gaming facilities and choose to sell or transfer such property in the future.
 
Resort Operations 
 
General 
 
Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments, and repay debt financings.
 
Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Lunar New Year. While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant portion of our operating income is generated from high-end gaming customers, which can cause variability in our results. In addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results. 
 
All of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of our newly acquired Empire City Casino which operates 20 hours a day, every day of the year. At our domestic resorts, our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or leased to third parties. We utilize third-party management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs. We lease space to retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities.
 
Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations

 Las Vegas Strip Resorts. At December 31, 2018, our Las Vegas Strip Resorts consisted of the following casino resorts: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York (including the Park), Excalibur, Park MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas) and Circus Circus Las Vegas.
 Regional Operations. At December 31, 2018, our Regional Operations consisted of the following casino resorts: MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland; and MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts.
 
Over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations, including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming amenities. We market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.
 
Our casino operations feature a variety of slots, table games, and race and sports book wagering. In addition, we offer our premium players access to high-limit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere. 
 
MGM China
 
We own approximately 56% of MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”), the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Macau is the world’s largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and we expect future growth in the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.
 
Our current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China’s revenues are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by MGM Grand Paradise. The Macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was granted by Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A., and expires in 2020. The Macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions, but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or 
 2


gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires, though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations.
 
Corporate and Other 
 
We have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations, including MGP’s Northfield. CityCenter Holdings, LLC (“CityCenter”) is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a fee.
Our Operating Resorts

Customers and Competition 
 
Our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States and internationally. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business.” We face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.”
 
Our primary methods of successful competition include:
  
• | Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Constructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention facilities and premier dining, entertainment, retail and other amenities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providing unique, “must-see” entertainment attractions; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations
 
Our customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions, trade associations, and small meetings. We have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resorts during mid-week and off-peak periods.
 
Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip Resorts also compete, in part, with each other. Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.
 
Outside Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where location is a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region. 
 
MGM China
 
The three primary customer bases in the Macau gaming market are VIP casino gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations. VIP gaming play is sourced both internally and externally. Externally sourced VIP gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer VIP players various services, such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel, food and beverage services. Gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover-based commissions. In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. Unlike gaming promoters and in-house VIP players, main floor players do not receive commissions. The profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the VIP segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. Gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this customer base represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future. To target premium main floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield, we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which include both table games and slots, to the main floor gaming area. The amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players.  
 VIP gaming at MGM China is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips and in turn they sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow us to track the 
 4


amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine VIP gaming play. Gaming promoter commissions are based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate. They also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate, which can be applied to hotel rooms, food and beverage and other discretionary customers-related expenses. Gaming promoter commissions are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. In-house VIP commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. 
 
Our key competitors in Macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires. If the Macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations, primarily on the Cotai Strip.
 
We encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world, including Singapore, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Russia, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region. 
 
Marketing
 
Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs. We advertise on radio, television, internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the use of social media. We also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities. Our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques that identify customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, and help build lasting customer relationships. 
 
M life Rewards, our customer loyalty program, is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in both gaming and non-gaming areas, encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts. We also offer the Golden Lion Club for gaming focused customers, in addition to M life Rewards, at MGM China. The structured rewards systems based on member value and tier level ensure that customers can progressively access the full range of services that the resorts provide. Our loyalty programs focus on building a rewarding relationship with our customers, encouraging members to increase both visitation and spend.
 
Strategy 
 
We strive to be the recognized global leader in entertainment and hospitality, embracing innovation and diversity to inspire excellence. The quality of our resorts and amenities can be measured by our success in winning numerous awards, both domestic and globally, including several Four and Five Diamond designations from the American Automobile Association as well as multiple Four and Five Star designations from Forbes Travel Guide, as well as numerous certifications of our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts.
 
Our strategic objectives include:
  
• | Operational enhancements. Drive continuous improvements in operational performance to support enterprise-wide increases in revenue, market share, cash flow, and margins;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Financial strength. Accelerate financial performance through optimal capital structure and disciplined investment of cash flows;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Corporate social responsibility. Continue to solidify the Company’s reputation as a global leader in the principles of Corporate Social Responsibility;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Geographic expansion. Execute a targeted approach to domestic and international expansion to increase global brand presence; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Business model innovation. Explore the evolution of the existing business model into new lines of business and key adjacencies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technology
 
Collectively we utilize various types of technology to maximize revenue, drive efficiency in our operations, and serve our customers more effectively. Information Technology continues to automate operations in an effort to control costs related to operations and implement leading edge solutions for all major lines of business. To aid this process, data and analytics are utilized to support making timely and accurate business decisions. A cloud first strategy is applied when possible to enable our technology solution delivery and speed to market. We are also focused on technology to enhance the guest experience. For example, our eCommerce platform provides our guests and business partners a premier digital experience where they have the ability to create an 
 5


all-inclusive experience from accommodations to dining and entertainment with real time recommendations provided based on the preference. 
 
Employees and Management 
 
We believe that knowledgeable, friendly and dedicated employees are a primary success factor in the hospitality industry. Therefore, we invest heavily in recruiting, training, motivating and retaining exceptional employees, and we seek to hire and promote the strongest management team possible. We have numerous programs, both at the corporate and business unit level, designed to achieve these objectives. We believe our internal development programs, such as the MGM Resorts University and various leadership and management training programs, are best in class among our industry peers. 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
 
We believe that profitability and social responsibility can be linked for long-term sustainability and profitability in furtherance of value t
o all our stakeholders – our shareholders, our employees, our customers and our communities. Whether we refer to our philosophy as Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) or associated Environmental and Social Governance (“ESG”) metrics, we strive to further two fundamental principles ‒ ethical, legal conduct in the way we conduct our business, and integration of social responsibility as a distinct, strategic discipline into the fabric of our culture and sustainable business operations.   
 
Through investment of many years of dedicated effort and resources, our evolving CSR approaches – grounded in prudent fiscal management and long-term focused strategies – have advanced us beyond leadership in the gaming and hospitality industry to national recognition for our accomplishments. 
 
Our core values of integrity, inclusion, teamwork and excellence shape our character and culture, the way we do business, and our CSR practices.  Four strategic pillars guide our work.
 
Fostering diversity and inclusion. Our commitment to inclusion translates diversity as a fundamental paradigm of the 21st century global economy into long-term human capital leadership, customer market expansion and competitive business advantage.  Inclusion is an important, multi-dimensional business imperative that attracts top talent; drives our culture of respect for humanity; leverages the broad diversity of our employees’ talents to drive excellence in collaboration, innovation and financial performance; fuels expansion of our customer markets and supply chain; and forges stronger ties with our communities around the world.
 
Investing in community.  The communities in which we operate, and our employees live, work and care for their families, are cornerstones of our business and our CSR system.  We create economic opportunity for local residents, collaborate to promote educational and develop skills of local workforces, engage local businesses, and stimulate economic development in our communities.  We promote responsible gaming practices and tools, such as GameSense, that keep gaming safe and entertaining.  Beyond our tax support of public education, infrastructure and services, we make philanthropic and development-related investments in long-term institutions that benefit our employees and customers and elevate the quality of life and culture in our communities.
 
Caring for one another.  We believe caring for less fortunate community neighbors is a deep-rooted part of our culture, and our actions help uplift the communities in which we operate, while simultaneously instilling employee pride and engagement in our business. Through three primary channels – our employee-driven MGM Resorts Foundation, our Employee Volunteer Program and our Corporate Giving Program, we contribute leadership, funding and manpower to an extensive array of nonprofit organizations that provide services, goods and resources indispensable to our communities’ well-being, development and stability.  Significantly, in 2018, our U.S. employees invested more than 123,000 hours of voluntary service with community non-profits and achieved a 71% participation level in giving through our MGM Resorts Foundation.    
 
Environmental sustainability. We continue to gain recognition for our comprehensive environmental responsibility initiatives in energy and water conservation, recycling and waste management, sustainable supply chain and green construction. Certain of our casino resorts in Nevada and our casino resort in Michigan were the first in each state to earn certification from Green Key, one of the largest international programs evaluating environmental sustainability in hotel operations. We received certifications at all of our domestic resorts and Aria and Vdara at CityCenter. Aria, Vdara, Bellagio, Delano, Mandalay Bay, and MGM Grand Detroit have all received “Five Green Key,” the highest possible rating. Many major travel service providers recognize the Green Key designation and identify our resorts for their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations. 
 
In addition, we believe that incorporating the tenets of environmental sustainability in our business decisions advances a platform for innovation and operational efficiency. CityCenter (Aria, Vdara and Veer) is one of the world’s largest private sustainable developments. With six LEED® Gold certifications from the U.S. Green Building Council (the “Council”), CityCenter serves as the 
 6


standard for combining luxury and environmental responsibility within the large-scale hospitality industry. Also, MGM National Harbor, The Park, and T-Mobile Arena have all been awarded LEED® Gold certification by the Council.
 
At MGM China, we incorporate the same commitment to environmental preservation. Our efforts to improve energy efficiency, indoor air quality, and environmental stewardship have resulted in MGM China being included in the Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Benchmark Index on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. MGM Cotai has achieved the China Green Building (Macau) Design label from the China Green Building and Energy Saving (Macau) Association.
 
Development and Leveraging Our Brand and Management Assets 
 
In allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts, spending on strategic developments or initiatives and repaying long-term debt or returning capital to shareholders. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns. 
 
We regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets. Opportunities we evaluate may include the ownership, management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada, or in states other than Nevada, or outside of the United States, accessing new markets for sports and interactive, as well as online gaming. We leverage our management expertise and well-recognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities. We feel that several of our brands are well-suited to new projects in both gaming and non-gaming developments. We may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties. 
 
During 2018, we entered into an agreement with GVC Holdings PLC to form Roar Digital LLC, a world-class sports betting and online gaming platform in the United States. The 50/50 venture will be capitalized with initial commitments of $100 million per partner. Under the agreement, the venture will benefit from the economics of our existing race and sports books and online gaming operations and will have exclusive access to certain U.S. land-based and online sports betting, online real money and free-to-play casino gaming, major tournament and online poker, and other similar future interactive businesses. The commencement of operations is subject to gaming regulatory approvals.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
Our principal intellectual property consists of trademarks for, among others, Bellagio, The Mirage, Borgata, Mandalay Bay, MGM, MGM Grand, MGM Resorts International, Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Circus Circus, Beau Rivage and Empire City, all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes in the United States. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties and services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration so long as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand development and identification, and enforcement of our trademark rights. 
Employees and Labor Relations 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 55,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time employees domestically, of which approximately 6,000 and 3,000, respectively, support the Company’s management agreements with CityCenter. In addition, we had approximately 11,000 employees at MGM China. We had collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 39,000 of our employees as of December 31, 2018. Collective bargaining agreements with three unions covering a substantial number of our employees in Las Vegas are scheduled to expire in the first half of 2019. We anticipate negotiations for successor contracts with all three of those unions will begin in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, in our regional properties, new collective bargaining agreements will be negotiated in 2019 at MGM National Harbor and MGM Springfield. As of December 31, 2018, none of the employees of MGM China are part of a labor union and the resorts are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. In January 2019, we acquired operations in New York that employ approximately 1,000 employees, a portion of which are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We anticipate several of these agreements will be negotiated in 2019. Also, in July 2018, MGP acquired its property in Northfield, Ohio, which continues to be operated (on behalf of MGP) by an affiliate of Hard Rock International (STP), Inc. MGM expects to acquire these operations in the first half of 2019, subject to certain customary closing conditions. The Ohio operation has employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, several of which we anticipate will be negotiated in 2019.
Regulation and Licensing 
 
The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. 
 7


These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.  
 
A more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
Our businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes (including regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities), construction, land use and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. 
 
In addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations. 
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
 
This Form 10-K and our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “will,” “may” and similar references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding expected market growth in Macau, our ability to generate significant cash flow and execute on ongoing and future projects, such as MGM 2020, and the expected results of MGM 2020, amounts we will spend in capital expenditures and investments, the opening of strategic resort developments, the estimated costs and components associated with those developments, our expectations with respect to future cash dividends on our common stock, dividends and distributions we will receive from MGM China, the Operating Partnership or CityCenter and amounts projected to be realized as deferred tax assets. The foregoing is not a complete list of all forward-looking statements we make. 
 
Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive, market, and regulatory conditions and the following:
