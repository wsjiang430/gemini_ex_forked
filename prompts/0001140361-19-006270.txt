Rice Mill
 
On November 28, 2018 we completed our acquisition of the assets and operations of the Golden Ridge Rice Mills, LLC’s rice milling and bran stabilization facility in Wynne, Arkansas.  Golden Ridge is a recently constructed rice milling facility that encompasses nearly 32 acres and specializes in #1 and #2 Grade U.S. premium long and medium white rice milled to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) standards.  Golden Ridge also produces brown rice, brewers rice, and brokens.  These are all synergistic ingredients for our target customers which should enable our sales team to deepen customer relationships in addition to leveraging Golden Ridge customers to our products.  Golden Ridge gives us a substantial presence in Arkansas, where more U.S. rice is produced and processed than any other rice-producing state, and provides a source of SRB that is closer to many of our customers in the Midwest and Eastern U.S., with active and attractive freight lanes.
 
The physical manufacturing nature of the process is very similar to our other locations.  All of our locations have similar standard operating procedures that are required of all food ingredient manufacturers to meet Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards and Safe Quality Food (SQF) certifications.  Golden Ridge not only sells rice, but also sells rice bran, husk byproducts, and a mix of both used for animal nutrition.  Golden Ridge, like our existing businesses, is subject to the exact same regulatory rules that we already adhere to.  It also obtains the same plant certifications and associated audits as our other locations.  Strategically, the acquisition of Golden Ridge is an extension of our existing business model that provides considerable room for expansion to increase our SRB production capacity as well as to house additional product development capacity to further expand our portfolio.
 
Our Products
 
We believe our greatest market opportunities are in the food ingredient and animal nutrition markets.  Nutritionally balanced, minimally processed, clean-label food and animal feed ingredients are in high demand and we are strategically positioned to take advantage of this growing and sustainable market opportunity as discussed below in “Our Growth Strategy.”
Food Ingredients
 
 Our SRB and derivative products are nutritional and beneficial food products that contain a unique combination of oil, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fibers, and antioxidants that enhance the nutritional value of popular consumer products.  Foods that are ideally suited for the addition of our SRB to their products include processed meats, cereals, snacks, beverages, baked goods, breading, and batters.


In 2008, we received USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) approval to market rice bran as an ingredient to be used as a filler in comminuted meat products, such as meat and poultry sausages that contain binders, nugget-shaped patties, meatballs, meatloaf and meat and poultry patties.  Our products replace ingredients like soy protein isolate, soy protein concentrate, modified food starch, pea protein and mustard flour at a significantly reduced cost.  With strong application benefits such as reduced cost per unit, increased product yield and reduced purge, we believe our SRB has a significant market opportunity in the comminuted meat market both inside and outside of the United States.
 
Animal Nutrition
 
Our SRB is marketed as a feed ingredient in the United States and international animal nutrition markets, and we will continue to pursue sales opportunities with attractive margins in those markets.  SRB is used as an equine feed ingredient and has been shown to provide health benefits.  Show and performance horses represent the premium end of the equine market and are a key target for our animal nutrition products.  We are also now pursuing numerous opportunities in the markets for companion animal products.
About Rice Bran
 
Rice is the staple food for over half of the world’s population, especially in some of the world’s most populous countries.  Asia accounts for roughly 90% of global rice production and China is the world’s number one rice producer.  Globally, the United States ranks 11th in rice production with approximately 2% of the global total.
 
When harvested from the field, individual rice kernels are stored in common receiving locations such as farm silos for future delivery to grain dryers or area rice mills.  At this stage, large quantities of individual rice kernels are collectively called “paddy rice,” or “rough” rice.  In this form, the rice kernel is fully enveloped by the rice hull, which serves as a protective cover, shielding the inner rice kernel from damage.

After storage and drying, if necessary, paddy rice is cleaned of foreign material (scalping, de-stoning and aspiration) just before it enters the first stage of milling, or paddy husking.  In the paddy husker, the hull is removed from rough rice by differential speed rubber rollers.  Loosened hulls are carried off by aspiration.  After husking, a paddy separator uses a reciprocating motion to separate normal brown rice kernels (caryopsis) from unhusked kernels which are returned to the paddy husker.
 
In the second stage of milling, the outer brown layers of bran are removed from the inner white starch endosperm by an abrasive or frictional milling process which produces a milled, white rice kernel.  After milling, white rice is typically sorted by size to remove broken pieces of rice kernels from whole kernels, as well as color sorting to remove discolored kernels.  Additional stages may be required (per customer specifications) to polish the white rice to a smooth surface.
 
Raw rice bran collected from the milling process is composed of rice germ and several sub-layers (pericarp, testa, nucellus and aleurone) surrounding the white starchy endosperm.  Commercial rice bran makes up approximately 10% of rough rice by weight.  Rice germ, an especially nutrient rich material, makes up approximately 10% of commercial rice bran by weight.
 
As brown rice is milled into white rice, the oils present in raw rice bran come into contact with native lipase enzymes that are naturally present in the rice kernel.  These lipase enzymes initiate a rapid enzymatic hydrolysis of the oil, converting oils (triglycerides) into monoglycerides, diglycerides and free fatty acids (FFA).  As the FFA content builds in raw rice bran, the bran becomes unpalatable and off flavors (rancidity) develop.  If left unchecked, enzymatic degradation at normal room temperatures can increase the FFA levels to 5-8% within 24 hours and can continue at a rate of approximately 4-5% per day thereafter.  Enzymatic degradation is the most serious form of degradation of raw rice bran.  Rice bran stabilization is the process of carefully deactivating native enzymes to prevent the increase of FFA otherwise caused by lipase enzyme activity.  Proper stabilization is critical in the preservation of the nutritional value of the bran, an important nutrient source that is largely used as animal feed or otherwise wasted.
 
Historically, there have been a number of attempts to develop rice bran stabilization techniques, including the use of chemicals, microwave heating or variations of existing extrusion technology.  Many of these approaches have had limited success in part because they have produced rice bran with limited shelf life or with significant degradation of nutrients.
 
Our Technologies
 
Our Proprietary Rice Bran Stabilization Technology
 
Our stabilization process uses proprietary innovations to create a combination of temperature, pressure and other conditions necessary to thoroughly deactivate enzymes without significantly damaging the structure or nutrient content of raw rice bran.  This means that higher value compounds in bran, such as oils, proteins and phytonutrients are left undamaged and are available for utilization.  Our process does not use chemicals to stabilize raw rice bran.
 
Our stabilizers are designed to be installed adjacent to, on the premises of or in near proximity to any conventional rice mill so that freshly milled raw rice bran can be quickly delivered to our proprietary stabilizers.  Process logic controllers maintain exact process conditions within the prescribed pressure/temperature regime.  In case of power failure or interruption of the flow of fresh bran into the system, the electronic control system is designed to purge the equipment of materials in process and resume production only after proper operating conditions are re-established.
 
SRB leaving our system is then discharged onto cooling units specifically designed to control air pressure and humidity.  Cooled SRB can be loaded into bulk hopper trucks for large volume customers or sent by pneumatic conveyor to a bagging unit for packaging into various size bags or 2,000-pound sacks.
 
Each stabilization module can process approximately 2,000 pounds of bran per hour and has a capacity of over 7,200 tons per year.  Stabilization production capacity can be doubled, tripled or further multiplied by installing additional units sharing a common conveyor and stage system, which we believe can handle the output of the world’s largest rice mills.  We have also developed and tested a smaller production unit, with a maximum production capacity of 600 pounds per hour, for installation in locations where rice mills are substantially smaller than those in the United States.
 
Additional patented and proprietary processes involve enzyme treatment of SRB to produce fractions enriched in one or more macronutrients, including proteins, fibers, lipids and micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals and phytosterols, among others.  In these processes SRB in an aqueous slurry, is treated with one or more enzymes, centrifugally separated and the fractions dried on drum driers, spray driers or other drying systems.

Our Stabilization Process
 
Rice bran is free of all major allergens and is a valuable source of protein with a balanced amino acid profile for food ingredient products and is rich in healthy oil, vitamins, antioxidants, dietary fiber and other nutrients.  The approximate composition and caloric content of our SRB is as follows:

Fat (oil) | 18-23% 
--------------------+--------------
Protein | 12-16% 
Total Dietary Fiber | 20-30% 
Moisture | 4-8% 
Ash | 6-14% 
Calories | 3.2 kcal/gram

 
Rice bran contains approximately 18-23% oil, which has a favorable fatty acid composition and excellent heat stability.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We hold eight U.S. patents relating to the production or use of rice bran and rice bran derivatives.  In addition to the issued U.S. patents, we have been issued fourteen foreign patents covering the subject areas.  We intend to apply for additional patents in the future as new products, treatments and uses are developed.
 
Our stabilization and processing activities are an adaptation and refinement of standard food processing technology applied to rice bran.  We have chosen to treat certain of our methods and processes as a trade secret and not to pursue process or process equipment patents on the original processes.  However, as we develop improvements we intend to periodically review whether we should seek patent protection for them.  We believe that certain unique products, and their biological effects, resulting from our SRB may be patentable in the future.  We also hold a number of U.S. registered trademarks and trade names and have applied for additional marks.
 
We continue to support internal as well as external R&D efforts that improve on existing technologies or lead to the development of new technologies relating to rice bran processing and applications.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We are pursuing a simple growth strategy based on a few key initiatives.  Management, working closely with our Board, is focused on growing our markets and business, generating positive adjusted EBITDA (earnings before depreciation, interest, taxes, amortization and share-based compensation to employees and directors), improving our financial condition, and maximizing shareholder value.  The following points summarize our growth strategy:

1. | Building a stronger pipeline of sales and growth from existing and new customers: During much of 2018 we repositioned and strengthened our sales team to take advantage of customer types and geographic reach. We continue to add expertise in companion animal, snacks and bakery, protein, and fiber areas to complement our existing selling strengths in equine and lifestyle markets. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The global and domestic markets are strong and rapidly expanding for minimally processed plant-based ingredients that provide dense and balanced nutrition in addition to evidence-based functionalities while also being free of all major allergens and being non-GMO.  The regulatory requirements to add front-of-label warnings on food items and increasing demand from consumers for foods that list fewer and less processed ingredients is driving food companies to replace standard food ingredients with cleaner ingredients, such as stabilized rice bran.  We anticipate further incorporation of our food ingredients by major consumer packaged goods food companies as more food companies adopt rice bran as a standard clean label food ingredient. This trend is not limited to food ingredients, as we are finding similar transition to clean ingredients among high-end animal nutrition companies.  We believe this positions us well to pursue these growth opportunities.

2. | Concurrently working to strengthen our bran supply, with a particular focus on expanding in the Delta region of the U.S.: We continue to meet with numerous participants in the U.S. rice milling industry to expand our footprint with additional bran supplies. We are focused on building a stronger presence in the Delta region of the U.S. rice industry, particularly in Arkansas and Louisiana, which typically account for near 70% of the U.S. rice harvest (nearly 50% in Arkansas alone). As such, we acquired Golden Ridge in Wynne, Arkansas in November 2018. We believe that Golden Ridge’s operations will add meaningful sales and EBITDA in 2019 with significant room for expansion of SRB production. We expect this mill to be an important component of our SRB supply in the Arkansas region. Building a stronger presence in the Delta will also provide us with logistical benefits to serve our customers located east of the Rocky Mountains. We intend to invest in strategic initiatives, including a significant expansion of the production capacity and construction of a world-class bran room capable of producing new, innovative, and technology-driven SRB products at Golden Ridge. We also remain committed to building a strong presence in California, which typically accounts for over 20% of the U.S. rice harvest.

3. | Driving operational efficiencies and cost and expense reductions: We are focused on improving our operational efficiencies while driving cost and expense reductions. Accounting cost absorption has been an historical issue for us, and we hope to improve absorption by driving greater volumes through our existing facilities, which should reduce our costs per unit of production. We have made considerable efforts to lower costs and expenses as well in areas related to headcount, salaries and wages, travel and entertainment, and shop supply purchases. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Consolidation of our operating footprint: We are focused on building our market presence in the Delta (Arkansas and Louisiana) in addition to our traditional focus in the Sacramento Valley region of California. We recently occupied a 59,800 square foot distribution, processing, and office facility in West Sacramento, CA. This facility provides us with a food grade building that will help us better meet our customer needs. We transitioned to a new corporate office in The Woodlands, Texas, during the second quarter of 2018. The Woodlands is located near Houston-Bush Intercontinental Airport, one of the most active airports in the U.S., and is a suburb of Houston, one of the fastest growing SMAs in the U.S. The Woodlands is about a 2 to 3-hour drive from our existing facilities in Mermentau and Lake Charles, Louisiana, and provides us flights of 75 minutes or less to reach most of the key rice milling areas of the Delta states. The large corporate population – the Houston SMA is habited by 54 Fortune 1000 companies – provides us a large pool of possible employees versed in public company needs. In addition, both regions allow us to partner with an established scientific and university community at and around institutions like University of California-Davis and Texas A&M.

5. | New product development: We are focused on extending our proprietary product and process technologies, finding new products and processes, and working to define new niches for existing products. We believe the acquisition of Golden Ridge will provide us with a platform to develop new products derived from SRB to expand growth opportunities.

Our Customers
 
We use internal sales staff, outside independent sales representatives and third-party distributors to market our portfolio of products to customers domestically and internationally.  In 2018 and 2017, three customers accounted for 35% and 39% of our revenues, respectively.  We continue to focus efforts on diversification of our customer base in an attempt to mitigate the concentration of customers.
Our Strategic Alliances
 
In February 2016, we entered into an exclusive supply and cooperation agreement with a Thailand-based entity (Youji) granting us the exclusive worldwide, supply and distribution rights, with certain exclusions, for their organic rice bran.  In addition, as part of the agreement, we have agreed to lease two of our proprietary stabilization extruders to Youji for stabilization purposes at one of their rice mills.
Government Regulations
    Our operations are subject to federal, foreign, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to zoning, workplace safety and accommodations for the disabled and our relationships with our employees are subject to regulations, including minimum wage requirements, anti-discrimination laws, overtime and working conditions and citizenship requirements.

Index

In both our United States and foreign markets, we are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints.  Such laws, regulations and other constraints exist at the federal, state and local levels in the United States, and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions, including regulations pertaining to the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale and storage of our products.  In addition, we are subject to regulations regarding product claims and advertising.
     The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, primarily the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the USDA.  Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are manufactured and sold, as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States, in which our products are manufactured and sold.  Among other matters, regulation by the FDA and FTC is concerned with product safety and claims made with respect to a product’s ability to provide health-related benefits.  Specifically, the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and sale of food and food ingredients.  The FTC regulates the advertising of these products.


Federal agencies, primarily the FDA and the FTC, have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them, including initiating investigations, issuing warning letters and cease-and-desist orders, requiring corrective labeling or advertising, requiring consumer redress such as requiring that a company offer to repurchase products previously sold, seeking injunctive relief or product seizures, imposing civil penalties or commencing criminal prosecution.  In addition, certain state agencies have similar authority.  These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the food and food ingredient industries, including the imposition of civil penalties.
 
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), enacted January 4, 2011, amended the FDCA to significantly enhance the FDA’s authority over various aspects of food regulation.  The FSMA granted the FDA mandatory recall authority when the FDA determines there is a reasonable probability that a food is adulterated or misbranded and that the use of, or exposure to, the food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.  One of the more significant changes under FSMA is the requirement of hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls (HARPC) for all human and animal food processing facilities.  We are committed to FSMA compliance and completed our SQF certification for each of our facilities.
 
Any substance that is intentionally added to food is a food additive and is subject to premarket review and approval by the FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the use of the substance is otherwise excluded from the definition of a food additive.  When an additive is proposed for use in a meat, its safety, technical function and conditions of use must also be evaluated by the USDA.  Because the USDA retains jurisdiction over meat products and food ingredients intended for use in meats, the use of our SRB meat enhancers is regulated by this agency.  SRB has USDA approval for use in certain meat products.
 
Animal feed ingredients are regulated by the FDA at the federal level and by the individual states.  Our SRB is defined for animal use as heat stabilized rice bran for use as a feed ingredient.
 
Our Competition
 
There are a number of companies that have invested significant resources to develop technologies for stabilizing and further processing rice bran and who market rice bran products with varying levels of stabilization into multiple markets around the world.  We believe that we have best of breed technologies for stabilizing rice bran and, as such, have developed significant brand recognition in the animal feed and food ingredient product sectors both domestically and internationally.  Together with our decades of application technology know-how and patented processing methods, we believe that we have a first-to-market advantage over the competition with respect to our SRB.
 
We are aware of several new producers of rice-based animal nutrition and food ingredient products in the United States, Europe and Asia.  We believe that our major competitors include producers of isolated soy protein, wheat bran and oat bran, particularly in the food ingredients market segment.
 
We compete with other companies that offer products incorporating SRB as well as companies that offer other food ingredients.  Many consumers may consider such products to be a replacement for the products we manufacture and distribute.
