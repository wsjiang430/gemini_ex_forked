ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Knowles,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to Knowles Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
Our Company
We are a market leader and global provider of advanced micro-acoustic, audio processing, and precision device solutions, serving the mobile consumer electronics, communications, medical, defense, aerospace, and industrial markets. We use our leading position in micro-electro-mechanical systems ("MEMS") microphones and strong capabilities in audio processing technologies to optimize audio systems and improve the user experience in mobile, ear, and Internet of Things ("IoT") applications. We are also the leader in acoustics components used in hearing aids and have a strong position in high-end capacitors. Our focus on our customers, combined with our unique technology, proprietary manufacturing techniques, rigorous testing, and global scale, enables us to deliver innovative solutions that optimize the user experience. Knowles, founded in 1946 and headquartered in Itasca, Illinois, has approximately 8,000 employees in 11 countries around the world.
Our Strategy
Our primary focus has been to position the Company to benefit from the positive trends we are seeing in our Audio segment. With products ranging from mobile phones to headsets, and from smart speakers to household appliances, voice-powered interactions are emerging as a critical and necessary feature. Consumers want to engage with technology through natural, spoken commands, across the mobile, ear, and IoT markets, and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs") are racing to develop and deploy the technology to enable it. Our unique capabilities in acoustics, digital signal processing, and algorithms place us in a competitive position to enable voice and audio input.
We have been focused on strategically positioning the business to support these broader trends around audio input including the acquisition of Audience, Inc. ("Audience") in 2015, which brought us essential digital signal processing and algorithm capabilities, and the divestiture of our low-margin speaker and receiver product line ("Speaker and Receiver Product Line") in 2016. During this time, we have also invested significantly in our core MEMS microphone and hearing health businesses to maintain our leadership positions and optimize our manufacturing footprint across our business units. 
In our Precision Devices segment, we continue to drive higher sales growth and improved operating margins through both organic initiatives and acquisitions. In 2017, we reshaped our portfolio by divesting our timing device business ("Timing Device Business") to increase our focus on growth platforms in Precision Devices where we have strong market positions and attractive margin profiles, including industrial, medical, defense, automotive, and telecom applications.
Our Business Segments
In January 2017, the Company changed its internal reporting to drive growth in our core business. Given the changes in the allocation of resources and in its internal reporting structure, the Company now reports two segments, Audio and Precision Devices ("PD"). As a result of this change, transducer products used in hearing health and premium headset applications were moved from the historical Specialty Components segment into the new Audio segment, which includes the historical Mobile Consumer Electronics segment. The capacitor products formerly in the Specialty Components segment are now included in the PD segment.
• Audio Segment
Our Audio group designs and manufactures innovative audio products, including microphones and balanced armature speakers, audio processors, and software and algorithms used in applications that serve the mobile, ear, and IoT markets. Locations include the sales, support, and engineering facilities in North America, Europe, and Asia, as well as the manufacturing facilities in Asia.
• PD Segment
Our PD group specializes in the design and delivery of highly engineered capacitors and radio frequency ("RF") devices for technically demanding applications. Our devices are used in applications including power supplies, radar, medical implants, and satellites, serving the industrial, defense, aerospace, medical, telecommunications, and automotive markets. Locations include the sales, support, engineering, and manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, and Asia.

We sell our products directly to OEMs and to their contract manufacturers and suppliers and to a lesser extent through distributors worldwide. Our products by segment on a continuing operations basis are as follows:

• | Audio - Includes analog and digital MEMS microphones, electret condenser microphones, smart microphones, ultrasonic sensors, acoustic processors, and balanced armature speakers.


• | PD - Includes capacitors and filters.

Market Trends
In our Audio segment, we have seen an inflection point with voice being embraced as a primary user interface across consumer electronic devices. Voice assistants are proliferating throughout a variety of applications from mobile phones to headsets, and from smart speakers to household appliances. Consumers want to engage with technology through natural, spoken commands, across the mobile, ear, and IoT markets, and OEMs are racing to develop and deploy the technology to enable it. Our core capabilities in acoustics, digital signal processing, and algorithms are unparalleled and place us in an ideal position to enable voice and audio input. 
Within the hearing aid market, sales are largely driven by aging demographics, healthcare spending, increasing affluence in emerging markets, and government subsidies.
Our Precision Devices segment sells multi-layer ceramic capacitors, electromagnetic interference filters, high reliability capacitors, single layer capacitors, precision variable capacitors, and thin film devices across diverse end markets, including industrial, defense, aerospace, medical, and telecommunications markets. Portions of this segment face much greater exposure to capital investment cycles and government spending, both direct and indirect, as some of these end markets are largely dependent on project upgrades, expansion, and government contracts.
Geographic Trends
We strive to maintain our manufacturing facilities in close proximity to our direct customers. In the case of Audio, we currently operate 5 facilities in Asia to serve the contract manufacturers who build OEM equipment on behalf of our end-customers. These contract manufacturers are largely based in China, Taiwan, India, Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Although end-user demand for consumer electronics and hearing aids is global and marketing activities occur globally, the majority of our manufacturing is located in Asia, primarily in China, Malaysia, and the Philippines.
In the case of PD, we operate 5 facilities in North America and 1 facility in Asia for the manufacturing of capacitors that support our global customers, as well as their suppliers and contract manufacturers.
Competitive Landscape
Success in the electronic components industry is primarily driven by innovation and flexibility as customers compete to gain a share of the growing consumer device market. We compete across handset, wearables, and other consumer platforms to deliver superior acoustic performance through customized products. Our investments in research and development enable us to capture new design wins across consumer OEMs. Our ability to balance and shift between full and semi-automation is key to our ability to optimize our operations and operating expenses. Additionally, it is important for suppliers to have flexibility and quick time-to-market to meet clients’ needs. Notably, according to industry estimates, the product cycle for mobile handsets has shortened over recent years. Key competitors include:

• | Audio - AAC Technologies, Goertek, Sonion, and Synaptics; and


• | PD - AVX Corporation, Kemet, and Murata.

In the Audio segment, our investments in research and development enable us to continually introduce new products with higher performance. Our customers are adopting these higher value microphones to improve the overall audio performance of their devices which in turn improves the end user experience. Typically our new products have higher average selling prices than the products they are replacing. Once introduced, the pricing for these products trend lower, as is typical in the consumer electronics market.

For products that were introduced more than 18 months ago, we strive to offset anticipated price erosion through bill of material cost reductions, yield improvements, equipment efficiency, and movement to lower-cost manufacturing locations.
In the PD segment, the end markets tend to be more stable. We see a highly fragmented set of competitors across capacitor products for a diverse set of end markets including industrial, defense, aerospace, medical, and telecommunications.
Customers, Sales, and Distribution
We serve customers in the mobile consumer electronics, industrial, defense, aerospace, medical, and telecommunications markets. Our customers include some of the largest OEMs and operators in these markets. In addition, many of our OEM customers outsource their manufacturing to Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) companies. Other customers include global mobile phone manufacturers, hearing aid manufacturers, and many of the largest global EMS companies, particularly in China.

We manufacture and develop our products as well as maintain sales and technical customer support offices in North America, Europe, and Asia. In our PD segment, we supplement our direct sales force with external sales representatives and distributors. Our global distribution center is located in Penang, Malaysia. Our worldwide sales force provides geographically specific support to our customers and specialized selling of product lines to various customer bases. For further detail and for additional disclosures regarding sales and property, plant, and equipment, net, by geographic location, see Note 17. Segment Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Raw Materials
We use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals, and semi-processed or finished components. Commodity pricing for various metals, such as palladium, gold, brass, stainless steel, and copper, fluctuates. As a result, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. Although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers, if commodity prices trend upward, we attempt to control such costs through fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs.
We rely on highly specialized suppliers or foundries for critical materials, components, or subassemblies that are used in our products which, in some cases, may be sole sourced from such suppliers or foundries or, such suppliers or foundries may also be a strategic supplier to one of our competitors or a customer. The loss of any single supplier has not had a material impact on operating profits. However, should an event occur which affects the ability or willingness of any supplier or foundry to continue to deliver materials or components to us in a timely manner, we may not be able to identify or qualify an alternative supplier in a 
timely manner which, in any such period and future periods, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding risks related to our business.
Research and Development
We concentrate our research and development efforts on the design and development of new products for each of our principal markets. We also fund certain other emerging product and technology opportunities. Expenditures for research and development in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $100.6 million, $93.4 million, and $92.0 million, respectively. Our future success is highly dependent upon our ability to develop complex new products, transfer new products to volume production, introduce them into the marketplace in a timely fashion, and have them selected for design into our customers’ products at competitive prices. Our future success may also depend on increasing acoustic content in our customers’ products including assisting our customers with integration of our products and software into their new products and providing support from the concept stage through design, launch, and production ramp.
Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets
We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property, products, and technology. Our U.S. patents expire in calendar years 2019 through 2037. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. We do not anticipate any material effect on our business due to any patents expiring in 2019, and we continue to obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development. We have maintained U.S. federal trademark registrations for KNOWLES, Knowles logo designs, along with various other trademarks. These U.S. registrations may be renewed as long as the marks continue to be used in interstate commerce. We have also filed or obtained foreign registration for these marks in other countries or jurisdictions where we conduct, or anticipate conducting, international business. To complement our own research and development efforts, we have also licensed and expect to continue to license, a variety of intellectual property and technologies important to our business from third parties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding risks related to our business.
Seasonality
In general, our businesses tend to have higher revenues in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. This is particularly true of those businesses that serve the consumer electronics market. Our businesses tend to have short product cycles due to the highly technical nature of the industries they serve which can result in new OEM product launches that can impact quarterly revenues, earnings, and cash flow.
Environmental and Social Responsibility Matters
As a socially responsible company, we strive to align our business practices and policies with the needs of our key stakeholders, and to that end we have developed environmental, social, and governance policies which can be accessed at our website, www.knowles.com.
Our operations are governed by a variety of international, national, state, and local environmental laws. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to the air, water, and soil; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; and requirements with respect to the treatment, transport, storage, and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws.
We are dedicated to the preservation and improvement of our global environment. We have established a Green Materials Policy, pursuant to which we have established a Green Materials Standard. Our products are in compliance with the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances ("EU RoHS") and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ("WEEE") directives. This standard is based on the list of substances identified in the Joint Industry Guide-101 Standard which is endorsed by the Electronic Industry Association, the Joint Electronics Device Engineering Council, and the Japan Green Procurement Survey Standardization Initiative associations as well as the Sony Standard-00259. As part of Knowles’s commitment to social responsibility and compliance with Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act") it is our goal to only use 3TG minerals in our products that do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo region.
Employees
We currently employ approximately 8,000 persons across our facilities in 11 countries. Approximately 78% of our employees are located in Asia. We are subject to various local, national, and multi-national laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees. Our workforce in the United States is not unionized. We believe we generally have good relationships with employees and their representative organizations.
