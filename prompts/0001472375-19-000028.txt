The Company has identified a cosmetic and skincare manufacturer and has agreed upon product formulations, the design and sourcing of packaging, and product costs.

With profound knowledge and expertise in cosmetic chemistry and professional skincare, this manufacturer has established itself as a leader in cutting edge formulations and product innovation in the field of skincare. 
 This manufacturer offers custom product formulation and manufacturing, allowing our Company to develop proprietary blends in order to privately brand our collection. 
 This supplier manufactures products in accordance with Good Manufacturing Procedures (GMP). It also follows the recommendations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada and also adheres to the Quality Assurance Guidelines of the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association.

 Business Segments
 
The Company consists of only one reportable business segment.
 
Employees
 
The Company does not currently have any employees other than the President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer who are responsible for strategic planning and development, as well as some operational duties. 
 
The majority of manufacturing, distribution, marketing, and sales operations will be outsourced. However, strategic planning and development will be performed internally by the Company. This includes, but is not limited to, developing our catalog of products, developing proprietary skincare formulations, pricing our products, deciding which markets to target, deciding which influencers to engage in marketing campaigns, developing sales channels such as our e-commerce sites, determining which marketing initiatives to pursue, and selecting strategic partners and suppliers to advance our business plans.
 
Facilities and Properties

As the production of our products will be outsourced to a manufacturer, the Company has no need for a physical manufacturing facility. 
 
The packaging and labeling of our products for shipping and distribution will also be outsourced. Management plans to outsource the delivery of its products to a name brand distributor who has an advanced fulfillment network. The Company will benefit from the distributor’s expertise in worldwide product delivery. As such, the Company has no need for a warehouse or distribution facility.
Manufacturing and Materials
 
The primary raw materials that we will use in the manufacture of our products are various botanicals, peptides, collagen and vitamin C. These raw materials are readily available from multiple suppliers and are utilized widely in the cosmetic and skincare industry.

Distribution
 We will sell our products primarily through our own e-commerce websites directly to consumers online through Company-owned and operated e-commerce sites. While we expect a majority of our online sales to be generated in the United States, we intend for expansion of online sales growth globally.
Marketing
 We intend to build brand awareness and sales through our digital presence, which encompasses e-commerce and m-commerce, as well as digital and social media. We wish to set the standard for online shopping by continually innovating to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews, and mobile phone and tablet applications). We will support our e-commerce and m-commerce businesses via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and consumer engagement. We will support our authorized retailers to strengthen their e-commerce businesses and drive sales of our brands on their websites. We will dedicate resources to implement coordinated, brand-enhancing strategies across all online activities to increase our direct access to consumers.
Competition
 There is vigorous competition in the skin care industry. Brand recognition, quality, performance, availability and price are some of the factors that impact consumers’ choices among competing products.  We will compete against a number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do.
Trademarks, Patents and Copyrights
 We have no trademark rights or patent rights. We intend to file an application for trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  We own the domain names www.eternelleskin.com, www.eternelleskincare.com, www.eternelleskincareproducts.com.
