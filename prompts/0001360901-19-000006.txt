Item 1. | Business

Overview
Evercore is one of the leading independent investment banking advisory firms in the world based on the dollar volume of announced worldwide merger and acquisition ("M&A") transactions on which we have advised since 2000. When we use the term "independent investment banking advisory firm," we mean an investment banking firm that directly, or through its affiliates, does not engage in commercial banking or significant proprietary trading activities. We were founded on the belief that there is an opportunity within the investment banking industry for a firm free of the potential conflicts of interest created within large, multi-product capital intensive financial institutions. We believe that maintaining standards of excellence and integrity in our core businesses demands a spirit of cooperation and hands-on participation more commonly found in smaller organizations. Since our inception, we have set out to build—in the employees we choose and in the projects we undertake—an organization dedicated to the highest caliber of professionalism and integrity.
We operate globally through two business segments:

• | Investment Banking; and


• | Investment Management.

Investment Banking
Our Investment Banking segment includes our global advisory business through which we deliver strategic corporate advisory, capital markets advisory and institutional equities services. In 2018, our Investment Banking segment generated $2.015 billion, or 98% of our revenues, excluding Other Revenue, net, ($1.576 billion, or 96%, in 2017 and $1.364 billion, or 96%, in 2016) and earned 663 Advisory fees from client transactions.
At December 31, 2018, our strategic corporate advisory and capital markets advisory businesses had 98 Senior Managing Directors with expertise and client relationships in a wide variety of industry sectors and broad geographic reach.
Strategic Corporate Advisory
Evercore's strategic corporate advisory business provides differentiated strategic and tactical advice, as well as unparalleled execution to financial sponsors and both public and private companies across a broad range of industry sectors and geographies. We help our clients identify and pursue strategic priorities, devise strategies to enhance shareholder value, and develop new ideas and deeper perspective to achieve their goals. 

• | Mergers and Acquisitions. In advising companies on an acquisition, merger or sale, we evaluate potential targets, provide valuation analyses, and evaluate and propose financial and strategic alternatives. We provide boards and management teams with independent judgment and deep expertise as they navigate their most important transactions and strategic decisions. We also advise as to the timing, structure, financing and pricing of a proposed transaction, as well as assist in negotiating and closing the deal.


• | Strategic Shareholder Advisory. Our extensive experience, insights into activist tactics, expertise in helping companies with shareholder communications and innovative defense strategies are instrumental in helping clients prepare for, avoid, and, if required, defend against activist investors and hostile takeover attempts. In public company situations, Evercore’s strategic shareholder advice is an integral part of our practice and is a decisive edge for clients seeking to obtain shareholder support for their transactions.


• | Special Committee Assignments. Evercore has a leading special committee practice which is driven by, and exemplifies, our overall commitment to independence, discretion, objectivity, and the delivery of unconflicted advice. Our team has a long history of providing impartial advice to special committees and assisting them to meet fiduciary duties and obligations in significant situations. 


• | Transaction Structuring. Evercore provides integrated advice in connection with the structuring of public and private transactions - including mergers, spin-offs, sales, joint ventures, and capital markets offerings - intended to optimize tax, accounting, and other objectives of the deal.

Capital Markets Advisory
Evercore is a leading advisor to clients on many of the largest and most complex corporate balance sheets in the global capital markets. Our flexible and integrated teams develop trust with clients by focusing on objectives and facts, not capital markets products. Functionally, Evercore can act as an independent advisor, capital placement agent, or underwriter based on each client's circumstances and preferences.

• | Equity Capital Markets. Evercore provides equity and equity-linked capital markets advice and execution designed to complement our firm's formidable corporate advisory platform. Our team provides its clients with independent advice, experienced judgment, and key insights on all aspects of capital formation and capital markets transactions. Our ECM team has the flexibility to engage with our corporate clients as an underwriter or an independent advisor.


• | Debt Advisory. Evercore provides independent advice to corporate clients on all debt capital markets products globally and, in conjunction with our Market Risk Management and Hedging team, on associated market related risks and hedging.


• | Private Placement Advisory. Evercore structures and executes private market transactions for public and private corporate clients who require direct private equity, credit or hybrid financing solutions.


• | Market Risk Management and Hedging. Evercore advises clients on all aspects of market-related risks arising from foreign exchange, interest rates, inflation and commodity prices in connection with cross-border M&A and financing transactions.


• | Private Capital Advisory. Evercore advises managers of private assets – private equity, private debt, real estate, infrastructure and others – seeking to recapitalize or liquidate their assets through a privately negotiated transaction (e.g. fund sales, asset refinancing and fund recapitalizations). In addition, Evercore provides advisory services focused on primary and secondary transactions for real estate oriented financial sponsors and private equity interests.


• | Private Funds. Evercore provides comprehensive global advisory services on capital raising for select private fund sponsors, including private equity, infrastructure and real estate, advising and executing on all aspects of the fundraising process, including competitive positioning and market assessment, preparation of marketing materials, investor development and documentation.


• | Restructuring. Evercore provides independent financial restructuring advice to companies, creditors, shareholders, and other stakeholders, both in-and out-of-court. We specialize in providing critical and unbiased advice to clients on complex balance sheet issues and transformational situations.

Institutional Equities
At Evercore ISI, our experienced research, sales and trading professionals deliver superior client service on a content-led platform, striving to be the best independent equity research resource to support our clients' overall money management needs. At December 31, 2018, Evercore ISI had 30 senior research and distribution professionals.

Our dedicated specialists provide access to our macro and fundamental research products and provide tailored solutions through conferences, roadshows and one-on-one meetings.


• | Trading. Evercore ISI’s trading professionals engage primarily in agency-only transactions, free of the potential conflicts of interest created by proprietary trading. Our team provides seamless execution, placing our clients’ interests first and executing transactions with efficiency, objectivity and discretion.


• | Corporate Access. Our corporate access team provides strategic and customized analyses to determine targeted investors and regional strengths. We provide planning and execution of non-deal roadshows, field trips, sector and macro conferences.

While we do not intend to raise any Evercore-sponsored funds, we maintain a strategic alliance to pursue private equity investment opportunities with Trilantic Capital Partners ("Trilantic").

– | On September 30, 2016, we entered into an agreement to transfer ownership of the Mexican Private Equity business and related entities to Glisco.

Our Strategies for Growth
We expect to deploy the majority of our capital to continue to grow our Investment Banking businesses. We intend to continue to grow and diversify our businesses, and to further enhance our profile and competitive position, through the following strategies:

• | Add Highly Qualified Investment Banking Professionals. We hired ten new Senior Managing Directors in 2018, expanding our capabilities in the U.S. and Europe and increasing our presence in Industrials and Consumer/Retail, as well as launching our real estate capital advisory team and expanding our equity research capabilities. We intend to continue to recruit and promote high-caliber strategic corporate, strategic and capital markets advisory, as well as equity research, professionals to add depth in industry sectors and products and services in areas that we believe we already have strength, and to extend our reach to sectors or new business lines and geographies that we have identified as particularly attractive. On occasion, these additions result from the acquisition of boutique independent advisory firms with leading professionals in a market or sector. Of equal importance, following our long-term strategy of developing internal talent, we also promoted six internal candidates to Senior Managing Director in our Advisory business in 2018 and intend to continue to promote our most talented professionals in the future.

• | Achieve Organic Growth and Improved Profitability in Investment Management. We are focused on managing our current Investment Management business towards growth and improved profitability. We also continue to selectively evaluate opportunities to expand Wealth Management.

People
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 1,700 people worldwide. None of our employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we believe we have good relations with our employees.
As a leading independent investment banking advisory firm, our core asset is our professional staff, including their intellectual capital and their dedication to providing the highest quality services to our clients. Prior to joining Evercore, many of our Advisory Senior Managing Directors, Senior Research and Sales and Trading Professionals and Portfolio and Client Relationship Managers held senior level positions with other leading corporations, financial services firms or investment firms.
Competition
The financial services industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. Our competitors are other investment banking, financial advisory and investment management firms. We compete both globally and on a regional, product or niche basis. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including transaction execution skills, investment performance, quality of equity research, our range of products and services, innovation, reputation and price.
Evercore's investment banking competitors can be categorized into three main groups: (1) large universal banks and bulge bracket firms such as Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and UBS, (2) independent advisory firms such as Lazard and Rothschild and (3) boutiques, such as Centerview, Greenhill, Moelis, Perella Weinberg and PJT Partners, among others. We believe, and our clients have informed us, that firms that also engage in acquisition financing, significant proprietary trading in clients' securities and the management of large private equity funds that often compete with clients can cause such firms to develop interests that may be in conflict with the interests of advisory clients. Since Evercore is able to avoid potential conflicts associated with these types of activities, we believe that Evercore is better able to develop trusted and long-term relationships with its clients than those of its competitors, which provide such services. In addition, we have a larger global presence and deeper sector expertise than many of the boutiques. Evercore ISI's business is also subject to competition from investment banks and other large and small financial institutions who offer similar services.
We believe that we face a range of competitors in our Investment Management business, with numerous other firms providing competitive services in each of our sectors. Evercore Wealth Management competes with domestic and global private banks, regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, registered investment advisors, commercial banks, trust companies and other financial services firms offering wealth management services to clients, many of which have substantially greater resources and offer a broader range of services, and ECB faces substantial competition from a large number of asset management companies, many of which are larger, more established firms with greater brand name recognition and more extensive client networks and product offerings. 
Competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.
Regulation
United States
Our business, as well as the financial services industry generally, is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and in the other jurisdictions where we operate. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the United States and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. In the United States, the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. Evercore Group L.L.C. ("EGL"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours through which we conduct our U.S. investment banking business, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") and is registered as a broker-dealer in various states and the District of Columbia. EGL is subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC. FINRA, a self-regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the SEC, adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities, of its member firms, including EGL. The SEC, FINRA, and regulators in various non-U.S. jurisdictions impose both conduct-based and disclosure-based requirements with respect to research reports and research analysts. State securities regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over EGL. The Private Funds Group is 
5


impacted by various state and local regulations that restrict or prohibit the use of placement agents in connection with investments by public pension funds.
Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of customers' funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, the financing of customers' purchases and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers and employees. In particular, as a registered broker-dealer and member of a self-regulatory organization, we are subject to the SEC's uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of a broker-dealer's assets be kept in relatively liquid form. The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC's uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital. EGL is also subject to the SEC's Market Access Rule, Rule 15c3-5. The Market Access Rule requires EGL to have controls and procedures in place to limit financial exposure by establishing capital thresholds for its trading clients and implementing controls to prevent erroneous orders. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are also subject to regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as amended (the "Patriot Act"), which impose obligations regarding the prevention and detection of money-laundering activities, including the establishment of customer due diligence and other compliance policies and procedures. Regulatory authorities are also increasingly focused on cyber security and vendor management. Failure to comply with any legal and regulatory requirements may result in monetary, regulatory and, in certain cases, criminal penalties.
We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business.
Three of our investment management businesses, EWM, ABS and Atalanta Sosnoff, are registered as investment advisors with the SEC. Registered investment advisors are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an advisor and advisory clients, state and local political contributions, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions. EWM is also an investment advisor to a mutual fund, which subjects EWM to additional regulations under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). ETC, which is limited to fiduciary activities, is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to, among other things, the Patriot Act, the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended, other federal banking laws and the state laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. 
Mexico
ECB is authorized by the Mexican Ministry of Finance to act as a broker-dealer and financial advisor in accordance with the Mexican Securities Market Law. ECB is subject to regulation and oversight by the Mexican Ministry of Finance and the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission, including the maintenance of minimum capital requirements. In addition, the Mexican Broker Dealer Association, a self-regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission, adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities of, its member broker-dealers, including ECB. ECB has been authorized by the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission to act as a trustee and to operate in the equity markets.
United Kingdom
Authorization by the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"). The FCA is responsible for regulating Evercore Partners International LLP ("Evercore U.K.") and Evercore ISI International Limited ("ISI U.K."), the London vehicle of Evercore ISI. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA") is the basis for the United Kingdom's ("U.K.") financial services regulatory regime. FSMA is supported by secondary legislation and other rules made under FSMA, including the FCA Handbook of Rules and Guidance. A key FSMA provision is section 19, which contains a "general prohibition" against any person carrying on a "regulated activity" (or purporting to do so) in the U.K., unless he is an authorized or exempt person. It is a criminal offense to breach this general prohibition and certain agreements made in breach may not be enforceable. The "regulated activities" are set out in the FSMA (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (as amended). Evercore U.K. is authorized to carry out regulated activities including: advising on investments, arranging (bringing about) deals in investments and making arrangements with a view to transactions in investments. ISI U.K. is also authorized to carry out these activities. As U.K. authorized persons, Evercore U.K. 
6


and ISI U.K. are subject to the FCA's high-level principles for businesses, conduct of business obligations and organizational requirements. The FCA has extensive powers to supervise and intervene in the affairs of the firms. It can take a range of disciplinary enforcement actions, including public censure, restitution, fines or sanctions and the award of compensation. 
FSMA also gives the FCA investigatory and enforcement powers in respect of contraventions of various European Union ("EU") regulations, including the Market Abuse Regulation, which prohibits insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information and market manipulation. The FCA is also able to prosecute a number of criminal offenses including, among other things, criminal insider dealing under the Criminal Justice Act 1993 and criminal market manipulation under the Financial Services Act 2012.
Regulatory Capital. Regulatory capital requirements form an integral part of the FCA's prudential supervision of FCA authorized firms. The regulatory capital rules oblige firms to hold a certain amount of capital at all times (taking into account the particular risks to which the firm may be exposed given its business activities), thereby helping to ensure that firms can meet their liabilities as they fall due and safeguarding their (and their counterparties') financial stability. The FCA also expects firms to take a proactive approach to monitoring and managing risks, consistent with its high-level requirement for firms to have adequate financial resources. However, as a so-called "exempt-CAD firm," Evercore U.K. is subject only to limited minimum capital requirements. 
Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorist Financing and Anti-Bribery. The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (the "Money Laundering Regulations") came into force on June 26, 2017 and implemented the Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive ("MLD 4"). MLD 4 is designed to reinforce the efficacy of EU law in countering money laundering and terrorist financing and to ensure that the EU framework is aligned with the International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation adopted by the Financial Action Task Force in 2012. The Money Laundering Regulations impose numerous obligations on Evercore U.K. and ISI U.K. (and other "relevant persons"), including, among other things, obligations to take appropriate steps to assess the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing to which the business is subject and to maintain policies, controls and procedures to mitigate and manage the risks identified in the risk assessment. The Fifth EU Money Laundering Directive ("MLD 5") came into force on July 9, 2018. It amends MLD 4, and must be transposed by member states by January 10, 2020. The objectives of MLD 5 include, among other things, extending the scope of MLD 4 to include a broader range of market participants, clarifying the enhanced due diligence requirements for client relationships or transactions involving high risk countries and improved access to beneficial ownership for customer due diligence information.
The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Terrorism Act 2000 also contain a number of offenses in relation to money laundering and terrorist financing, respectively. Evercore U.K., ISI U.K. (and potentially other Evercore entities with a 'close connection' to the U.K.) are also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, which came into force on July 1, 2011. It provides for criminal penalties for bribery of, or receipt of a bribe from, public officials, corporations and individuals, as well as for the failure of an organization to prevent a person with whom it is associated from providing bribes for the organization's benefit. 
Regulatory Framework in the European Union. Both Evercore U.K. and ISI U.K. have obtained the appropriate European investment services passport rights to provide cross-border services into a number of other members of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Evercore U.K. has also obtained a passport to provide specific investment services from a Spanish branch. These "passports" derive from the pan-European regime established by the recast EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ("MiFID II"), which along with the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation ("MiFIR"), regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EEA. MiFID II provides investment firms which are authorized in any one EEA member state the right to provide investment services on a cross-border basis, or through the establishment of a branch to clients located in other EEA member states (known as "host member states") on the basis of their home member state authorization without the need for separate authorization by the competent authorities in the relevant host member state. This practice is known as "passporting." 
MiFID II and MiFIR set out a number of investor protection and conduct of business rules, including strict restrictions on investment firms making or receiving so-called "inducements" including research published by broker-dealers, such as EGL and ISI U.K. MiFID II and MiFIR also set out a harmonized regime for access by non-European firms to the EU investment services market. These place some limits on the ability of Evercore entities outside of Europe to provide investment services within Europe. 
Hong Kong
In Hong Kong, our subsidiary, Evercore Asia Limited ("Evercore Asia") is licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission ("SFC") to conduct certain corporate finance activities and securities dealing and advising activities that are related to corporate finance. The compliance requirements of the SFC include, among other things, paid-up share capital, liquid capital and conduct 
7


of business requirements. The directors and certain officers, employees and other persons affiliated with Evercore Asia are also subject to SFC licensing and/or compliance requirements.
Singapore
In Singapore, Evercore Asia (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. maintains a Capital Market Services license issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore ("MAS") for dealing in securities and advising on corporate finance. The compliance requirements of MAS include conduct of business requirements and rules relating to client assets, among other things.
Dubai
Financial services activities in or from the Dubai International Financial Authority, a free-zone located in the United Arab Emirates, Emirate of Dubai, are regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority ("DFSA") and are subject to licensing requirements. Evercore Advisory (Middle East) Limited maintains licenses issued by the DFSA for (i) advising on financial products, (ii) arranging credit and advising on credit and (iii) arranging deals in investments. The compliance requirements of the DFSA include, among other things, conduct of business requirements and anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing and sanctions requirements.
General
Certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, the privacy of client information, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by financial authorities and self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability.
The U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States, are empowered to conduct periodic examinations and initiate administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a regulated entity or its directors, officers or employees.
