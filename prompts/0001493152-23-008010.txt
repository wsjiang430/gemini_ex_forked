Overview
 
We are a clinical biotechnology company developing a novel and patented systemically-administered anti-cancer and anti-viral immunotherapy. We have evolved from more than a century of immunotherapy advances. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that efficient activation of both innate and adaptive immune cells and associated anti-tumor and anti-viral immune responses will require a multi-targeted package of immune system activating signals that can be administered safely intravenously. Our patented technology is composed of single strains of attenuated and killed, non-pathogenic, Gram-negative bacteria, designed to have reduced i.v. toxicity, but largely uncompromised ability to prime or activate many of the cellular components of innate and adaptive immunity. This approach has led to broad anti-tumor and anti-viral activity in pre-clinical models, including durable anti-tumor response synergy observed with each of five different classes of existing agents, including checkpoint therapy, targeted antibody therapy and low-dose chemotherapy. Tumor eradication by our technology has demonstrated activation of both innate and adaptive immunological memory and, importantly, did not require provision of or targeting a tumor antigen in pre-clinical models. We have carried out successful current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) manufacturing of our lead clinical candidate, Decoy20, and completed other Investigational New Drug application (IND) enabling studies.
 
Unlike many competitor products, our technology does not depend on targeting with or to a specific antigen, providing broad potential across multiple indications. Our products are designed to have a much shorter half-life and produce less systemic exposure than small molecule, antibody or human cell-based therapies, potentially reducing the risk of non-specific auto-immune reactions. Our technology has produced single agent activity and/or combination therapy-based durable responses in lymphoma, hepatocellular, colorectal and pancreatic tumors and has also showed activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV infection in standard pre-clinical models. In May 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors where currently approved therapies have failed and in December 2022, we initiated this Phase 1 clinical trial. Target indications include, but are not limited to, colorectal, hepatocellular (± HBV), bladder, cervical and pancreatic carcinoma, which according to GLOBOCAN 2020, account in the aggregate for 23% of yearly cancer cases and over 28% of yearly cancer deaths world-wide.
 
Historically, we have operated virtually with a team of highly experienced consultants and advisors, carrying out research and development at contract research organizations (CROs). We have a broad patent portfolio with 34 granted patents and 16 pending patent applications. Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through public and private offerings of our equity securities.
 
Background
 
Approved immunotherapies, such as Interluekin-2, Interferon-alpha and the more recently approved “checkpoint” and CAR-T therapies produce durable responses in a few percent to about fifty percent of patients across about a dozen out of over one hundred different types of cancer. Although checkpoint therapies are able to effectively cure many previously incurable patients, only about 15% of patients receiving this type of therapy respond. The main limitation of existing immunotherapies is that they each activate only one or a small number of key steps in either the innate or adaptive immune system, but there is general agreement that highly efficient cancer immunotherapy will require activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. The human body’s innate and adaptive immune systems are each capable of cell-mediated destruction of tumors if the tumor cells are recognized as foreign or damaged. Activation of innate and adaptive responses is also dependent on immune cells sensing the presence of “danger.” The most potent immune cell activating danger signals are released by bacteria and viruses in the setting of infection, and include agonists of immune cell receptors, such as Toll-Like (TLR), NOD and STING. Bacterial danger signals, including TLR agonists are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and can activate both innate and adaptive immune cells, including antigen-presenting cells, promoting innate (NK, macrophage) and adaptive (T cell-mediated) destruction of tumors.

The oldest form of cancer immunotherapy involves the provision of decoy danger signals from bacteria. It was based on the long-standing observation of tumor regression in the setting of bacterial infection. Treatment of cancer patients with heat-killed bacteria (“Coley’s toxins”) was established in 1891 and used for 70 years with significant success. For example, ≥5-year survival was reported for 45% of 432 inoperable sarcoma, lymphoma, melanoma, and carcinoma patients. Despite this success, several limitations led to the abandonment of this approach by the pharmaceutical industry. Although there was an indication that Coley’s toxins worked best when administered intravenously (i.v.), it was too toxic when given by this route, limiting the approach to local administration, which produced highly variable results. Another limitation was lack of knowledge about the mechanism of action, preventing optimization and standardization of manufacturing, leading to another source of variability in clinical response. Due to this high variability, Coley’s toxins was not grandfathered-in as an approved drug by the FDA in 1963 and was supplanted by radiation and chemotherapy, despite the fact that these more modern approaches rarely produce durable responses in advanced cancer patients. Scientists now understand the mechanism of action of Coley’s toxins. Gram-negative bacteria contain multiple immune-stimulating danger signals, including TLR agonists such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Bacteria and purified or mono-specific TLR agonists, including LPS derivatives, have been validated and approved for prevention and treatment of early stage cancer. However, a safe and effective TLR agonist-based approach for advanced cancer has been elusive, possibly due to limitations in the ability of intratumorally administered, mono-specific TLR agonists to induce potent, systemic anti-tumor immune responses. In addition, the intratumoral approach is not feasible with all tumor types or patients. Our hypothesis is that an effective TLR agonist-based immunotherapy for advanced cancer will require invention of a packaged, multi-TLR agonist or multi-danger signal product that is modified or attenuated to allow safe i.v. administration.
 
Our Approach
 
Our patented approach is based on the hypothesis that efficient activation of both innate and adaptive immune cells and associated anti-tumor immune responses can be achieved by using intact bacteria, containing multiple PAMPs, which have been attenuated so that they can be administered safely intravenously. Because LPS appears to be the most important contributor to both toxicity and efficacy, our patented product candidates are single strains of killed, non-pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria that have been treated in an effort to kill the bacteria and significantly reduce, but not completely eliminate, the cell surface LPS-endotoxin activity. Our product candidates are designed to have enhanced sufficient residual LPS to synergize with other PAMPs in the bacteria to efficiently prime innate and adaptive immune pathways. This approach has led to broad anti-tumor responses, including synergistic regressions and durable responses with five different classes of existing anti-tumor agents, in preclinical models, including checkpoint therapy, targeted antibody therapy and low-dose chemotherapy. Tumor eradication by our technology is designed to produce both innate and adaptive immunological memory and, importantly, not require provision of an exogenous tumor antigen, potentially due to the ability of LPS and other PAMPS to activate dendritic cells that have already captured a tumor antigen.
 
All immune cells can participate in killing of tumors and viruses. As illustrated below, current therapies activate only one or a small subset of both pathways and cure only a small percentage of patients.

Our technology, however, is designed to synergize with existing therapies to activate both innate and adaptive immune cells, inducing efficient anti- tumor immune responses with a wide safety margin. Induction of adaptive anti-tumor immune responses and immunological memory by our technology does not require an exogenous tumor antigen.
 

Innate and adaptive immune responses require identification of a tumor as foreign or not self. However, most steps required for migration and activation of immune cells are unrelated to the tumor or are tumor non-specific. All innate and adaptive non-specific steps are induced or promoted by immune system “danger signal” molecules, such as those found in our bacteria. Bacteria-derived danger signals are also able to enhance the processing and recognition of tumor antigens, which are frequently present, but not “seen” by the immune system.
 

Results
 
We have developed patented treatment methods (and associated patented compositions) for attenuation and killing of non-pathogenic, Gram-negative bacteria (34 issued or granted patents). In preclinical models, Indaptus treated bacteria induced less systemic toxicity than untreated bacteria but were still able to activate innate and adaptive immune responses. Despite exhibiting reduced in vivo pyrogenicity and a higher maximally tolerated dose, our bacteria were able to induce secretion of most cytokines and chemokines from mouse and human immune cells in vitro at levels comparable to those seen with untreated bacteria. Our bacteria were also able to synergize with human immune cells to kill human tumor cells in vitro.

We have observed significant single agent anti-tumor activity and/or combination therapy-mediated regression with durable responses in established non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, as well as colorectal, hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinoma in pre-clinical syngeneic and human tumor xenograft models. Our bacteria synergized with each of five different classes of approved agents in preclinical models, including checkpoint therapy, targeted antibodies, low-dose chemotherapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cytokines to induce tumor regression, providing significant flexibility for targeting of diverse types of cancer. Our technology is designed to eradicate tumors via activation of both innate (NK cell) and adaptive (CD4+ and CD8+ T cell) mechanisms, with the goal of producing both innate and adaptive immunological memory. In our preclinical studies, tumor eradication occurred at non-toxic doses of our bacteria, with a very wide (10 to ≥33-fold) therapeutic index. Notable mechanism of action information has also been obtained, via gene expression analysis with treated tumors and plasma cytokine analysis, demonstrating that our combination technology has the potential to turn “cold” tumors into “hot” tumors and induce, activate or recruit innate and adaptive genes, cells and pathways. Immune cell pre-depletion studies have demonstrated that both innate (NK) and adaptive (CD4 T and CD8 T) immune cells are involved in tumor eradication. We have also demonstrated significant single agent activity against chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in standard pre-clinical models.
 
We have carried out successful cGMP manufacturing and stability studies with our lead product candidate, Decoy20. In addition, IND-enabling multi-dose toxicology studies have been completed and did not produce sustained induction of factors that are associated with cytokine release syndrome.
 

The chart above demonstrates that our bacteria synergize with Anti-PD-1 Checkpoint therapy to regress established mouse hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Tumors. All mice (all groups) received a low-dose, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID/Indomethacin), which increases the number of regressions in the combination setting. Most regressions were durable, with 5/6 combination regressions stable through termination at Day 91 and in a repeat experiment through termination at Day 143 (see next Figure below) (CR = complete response or complete regression). The repeat experiment also produced 5/6 or 6/6 durable regressions per group over a 33-fold Indaptus concentration range and an absence of safety concerns, demonstrating a very wide therapeutic index. Similar tumor eradication results have been obtained by combining our bacteria with low-dose chemotherapy in a mouse non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma model. Eradication of established non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma tumors by our technology has also been observed with human tumor xenografts, via activation of the innate immune system.

The chart above illustrates that the synergistic tumor eradication by our technology and Anti-PD-1 produces immunological memory. Established tumors were regressed in 11 mice by combination treatment as in the Figure above and then the mice were re-challenged with fresh HCC tumor cells, without further treatment. All of the new tumors were rejected. Similar results have been obtained by combining our bacteria with low-dose chemotherapy in a non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma model.
 
In May 2022, the FDA cleared our IND application for a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors where currently approved therapies have failed, and in December 2022, we initiated this Phase 1 clinical trial which is an open label, multi-center, dose escalation and expansion, single arm (monotherapy) study conducted in 2 parts. The Phase 1 study has begun with a single dose escalation, which is planned to be followed by an expansion part with continuous weekly administration of Decoy20. The study is enrolling patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, who have exhausted approved treatment options. The study’s objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of Decoy20, to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose, as well as to assess Decoy20 pharmacokinetics (“PK”), pharmacodynamics and clinical activity. The primary endpoint of the study is incidence, relatedness and severity of adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse events and determining the number of subjects per cohort with dose limiting toxicity-based adverse events. Secondary endpoints include the incidence of anti-drug antibodies and neutralizing antibodies pre- and post-treatment, change in Decoy20 PK parameters over time, objective response rate in subjects with measurable disease and duration of response.

Competitive Advantages
 
Our bacteria contain multiple constituents, capable of priming or activating many of the cellular components of both innate and adaptive immunity, but have been attenuated by a patented process to reduce the potential for over-stimulation of the immune system and consequential induction of undesirable autoimmune reactions. Our bacteria are also likely to be cleared very quickly by the liver and spleen, which may further reduce the risk of non-specific autoimmune side effects, relative to other types of immunotherapy that are designed for continuous exposure. We believe a short Indaptus exposure is sufficient to act alone and as a “primer” to enhance other products. Additionally, our products can be manufactured by a highly cost-efficient process, potentially providing accelerated patient access in both developed and developing geographical regions.
Governmental Regulation
 
Among others, the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
 
U.S. Regulation of Drugs and Biologics
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations and other applicable regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually; 
● | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical study may be initiated; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), requirements to establish the safety and efficacy, or with respect to biologics, the safety, purity and potency of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 
● | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA) or biologics license application, (BLA), after completion of all pivotal clinical studies; 
● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review; 
● | potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed product drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of potential inspection of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and 
● | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.

Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. An IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the trial includes an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about on-going or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted.
 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and a separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 
Furthermore, an independent IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries, including clinicaltrials.gov.
 
The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
 

● | Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2. The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
● | Phase 3. The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 
During the development of a product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMPs. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
NDA and BLA Review Process
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated and sponsored by investigators. The submission of an NDA or BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial pediatric study plan within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the submitted BLA or NDA to determine if the application is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once an NDA or BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is sufficient to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product candidate is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. When reviewing an NDA or BLA, the FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

--


Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA or BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA or BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA or BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA or BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, product candidates are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once an NDA or BLA is submitted, the application may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
 
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.

Any marketing application for a drug or biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For new-molecular-entity NDAs and original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
 
Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies in a timely manner or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.

Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA or BLA. Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals; 
● | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; 
● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
● | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products and biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.

Drug Product Marketing Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. For example, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
 
Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are highly similar, or “biosimilar,” to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, is generally shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. A product shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product may rely in part on the FDA’s previous determination of safety and effectiveness for the reference product for approval, which can potentially reduce the cost and time required to obtain approval to market the product.
 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.

Other Healthcare Laws
 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Such laws include, without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security and physician and other healthcare provider transparency laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. The coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.
Healthcare Reform
 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each as amended, collectively known as the ACA, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and changes to fraud and abuse laws. By way of example, the ACA:

● | increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; 
● | required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and 
● | imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs. 

 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, or AMP, beginning January 1, 2024. Most recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated.

Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, proposed and enacted legislation and executive orders issued by the President designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge and scientific resources provide us with certain competitive advantages, we face competition from many sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Many of these competitors may have access to greater capital and resources than us. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with new immunotherapies that may become available in the future. Our competitors include larger and better funded biopharmaceutical, biotechnology and therapeutics companies, specifically companies focused on cancer immunotherapies, such as Amgen, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, BMS, Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding Ltd and Sanofi S.A. On the other hand, many of these companies are developing immunotherapeutics which may have potential to be used in concert with Decoy20 and in this regard, we view them as potentially complimentary.
 
With respect to our lead candidate, Decoy20, there are a number of companies that are developing possible treatments for cancer, however, we believe we are the only company using systemic administration of killed, non-pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria with reduced lipopolysaccharide- endotoxin to stimulate innate and adaptive immune system pathways.
 
Our success will be based in part upon our ability to successfully commercialize Decoy20 and to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of therapeutics that are safer and more effective than competing products in our target indications. Our market opportunity has the potential to be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any therapeutics we may develop. Our competitive position will also be dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, and protect our intellectual property, and to secure sufficient capital resources for the period between technological conception and commercial sales. The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property, and to operate without infringing or violating the proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws, know-how, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights (including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements) to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property, including related intellectual property rights.
Patents
 
As of March 1, 2023, we own 34 granted patents and 16 pending patent applications to use within our field of business. Our patents and patent applications generally relate to compositions and methods for treating cancer and infectious diseases, and our patents and any patents that issue from our pending patent applications are expected to expire at various dates between 2033 and 2039.
 
We intend to submit patent applications for each new product and technology that we develop. The patent outlook for companies like ours is generally uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and consolidate our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or any patent applications that we may license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future, or patents that we may exclusively license, may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or found to be invalid or unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. We cannot be certain that we were the first to invent the inventions claimed in our owned patents or patent applications. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with any meaningful competitive advantages against these competitors. Furthermore, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
 
Trade Secrets and Confidential Information
 
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We rely on, among other things, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our proprietary know-how and other intellectual property that may not be patentable, or that we believe is best protected by means that do not require public disclosure. For example, we require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment relationships with us, and to disclose and assign to us inventions conceived in connection with their services to us. However, there can be no assurance that these agreements will be enforceable or that they will provide us with adequate protection. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 
We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business. For a more comprehensive summary of the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Our operations involve the use of potentially hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. Although we generally contract with third parties for the operations that involve the disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. Based on information currently available to us, we do not expect environmental costs and contingencies to have a material adverse effect on us. However, we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements in connection with our operations or property, including fines, penalties and other sanctions, investigation and cleanup costs and third-party claims. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. See “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Healthcare Laws and Other Legal Compliance Matters - Violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could subject us to fines, penalties or other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.”
 
We believe that our business, operations and facilities are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.
 
Human Capital Management
 
As of December 31, 2022, we have six full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.
 
We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. In particular, we depend on the skills, experience and performance of our senior management and research personnel. We compete for qualified personnel with other biotechnology, medical device, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, as well as universities and non-profit research institutions.
 
We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include incentive compensation plan, pension, healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, and family leave, among others. We also use targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly for our key employees.
 
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health and safety of our employees including safety measures that are required for the COVID-19 pandemic and that comply with government regulations.
 
We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
