Business Overview
 What we do
 Cambium Networks is a global technology company that designs, develops, and manufactures wireless broadband and Wi-Fi networking infrastructure solutions for a wide range of applications, including broadband access, wireless backhaul, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), public safety communications and Wi-Fi access. Our products are used by businesses, governments, and service providers to build, expand and upgrade broadband networks. Our product lines fall into three broad, interrelated categories: Fixed Wireless Broadband (FWB), Enterprise networking, and Subscription and Services. The FWB portfolio spans point-to-point (PTP) and point-to-multi-point (PMP) architectures over multiple standards, including IEEE 802.11 and 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Program), and frequency bands, including licensed, unlicensed and lightly licensed spectrum. The Enterprise portfolio includes Wi-Fi access points, wireless aware switches, and other networking devices.
The Subscription and Services portfolio includes network planning and design as well as cloud or on-premises network management and control. The latter capability, delivered through subscription to cnMaestro X, forms the foundation of our ONE Network, a cloud-based network management architecture that allows users to remotely configure, monitor, and manage their wireless network. It provides a single, centralized view of all network devices, including both FWB and Enterprise, as well as real-time performance and usage data, and allows users to make changes to the network configuration and settings. Advanced services offered in conjunction with this platform include application visibility and control which is used to optimize end user experiences; integrated security gateway and SD-WAN for small and medium business; and automated and intelligent network optimization.
Our strategy
Our strategy is to enable our customers to build broadband and internet access networks that deliver exceptional digital experiences at an affordable total cost of ownership. The foundation of our strategy is the Cambium ONE Network which brings integration and automation to our entire portfolio. It removes a great deal of complexity, making it easier to plan, deploy and operate a broadband network from core to edge, using a wide range of wireless technologies, standards, and radio frequency (RF) spectrum.
Our software and other tools enable network services that address a primary operating cost and constraint to growth faced by most network operators. Our approach is to simplify and automate the design, deployment, optimization, and management of broadband and Wi-Fi access networks through intelligent automation. For example, the policy-based automation feature on our cnMatrix switches enables the establishment of policies for each end-point device type and then automatically propagates those policies across all switch ports in the network, regardless of the actual port each device is plugged into.
Managing operating expenses, such as energy consumption, is increasingly of importance to network operators. Our solutions can aid in the reduction of energy consumption costs by requiring fewer devices to operate the network to achieve a given coverage and capacity. Our portfolio does not have the overhead required for mobile infrastructure that can contribute to energy consumption. For example, where electricity is unreliable or not available, our purpose-built FWB products have been successfully deployed using only solar and battery power.
In our product development we strive to minimize capital outlays required by end users of our products. First, we innovate on top of industry standard technologies to optimize the performance per dollar invested in the network. Second, our software-defined radios, with their ease of remote configuration via cnMaestro, together with our commitment to backward compatibility, extends the life of our products, while also minimizing truck-rolls otherwise needed by the end user to configure and install new products.
Increasingly, performance and cost are important metrics for most network operators. A key differentiation between network products and services providers for most network operators will be the availability of integrated services layered on top of the network. We enable our end users to customize networks with bespoke or third-party services provided by or enabled by us.
 Meeting new trends
 The post-COVID era has redefined the workspace in the midst of a rebalancing between the enterprise and home. Businesses and individuals both expect seamless, secure communication and connectivity, whether from the conference room or the living room. The number of applications and devices on the network - from gaming, streaming media, and home automation, to enterprise applications running in the cloud, as well as applications that enhance automation and security, will continue to increase on a global basis. Some applications need more bandwidth. Other applications need lower latency.
As a result of continuing of labor shortages across industries, businesses are leveraging IIoT devices in digital transformation initiatives. Increasingly, wireless broadband is being chosen over fiber or CAT5 to economically connect security cameras. Simultaneously, networking technologies and standards continue to iterate, providing new capabilities and choice points for network
operators. The result is a network edge that has evolved from a static connection to a highly complex, constantly evolving platform supporting a growing array of services. 
Our FWB and Wi-Fi access, switching technologies, and software are designed to be cost-efficient and deliver high-quality digital experiences and device connectivity around the world. Our goal is to enable edge-of-the-network intelligence and the ability to adapt and respond to change. We are building and enabling a suite of services, deployed at scale with minimal human intervention, that will enable the network to be dynamic.
Expanding our addressable markets
Today, fierce competition to provide broadband access in rural, suburban, and urban markets is driving down subscription prices while simultaneously driving up performance requirements. We expect to respond to growing trends such as the following:
 •The implementation of broadband networks comprised of both fiber and wireless solutions. WISPs are adding fiber to their networks while wireline and mobile operators are adding FWB to extend their network where fiber, or mobile-based fixed wireless, is not viable. Our newly released 5G Fixed solution along with the upcoming release of 6 GHz spectrum will give broadband operators even more opportunity for cost-effective network expansion.
 •FWB as an alternative to fiber. Our enterprise and state and local government customers are discovering that street-level high-speed FWB networks, taking advantage of buildings and streetlights rather than towers, is an economically compelling alternative to fiber, and enables accelerated time to service when outdoor connections are needed to backhaul Wi-Fi and/or security cameras. For example, the combination of FWB and Wi-Fi has been successfully deployed in national parks and campgrounds. 
 •Growth of enterprise networking managed services. The market for enterprise networking managed services for hospitality and high density living, such as apartment buildings and senior living, is expanding. Our solutions are designed to enable managed service providers to cost effectively deploy and manage high value offerings for multiple hospitality or multi-dwelling unit clients using the MSP dashboard within cnMaestro X. 
 •Applications for national defense and security initiatives. We are actively engaged with national defense connectivity initiatives, working closely with systems integration partners. Although we have focused on high-capacity PTP FWB networking solutions, national government network operators have an equal need for the same FWB, Wi-Fi, switching, and value-added services as municipal, state, enterprise, and industrial network operators, although with added requirements for information assurance, security and other domain specific attributes.

Our technology and products
 Our ONE Network strategy takes advantage of advances in wireless standards, software defined radios and open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to enable the centralized management of a range of network technologies. Our products and services enable network operators to build a platform using heterogeneous wireless technologies without requiring a separate management platform for each one. Our addition of intelligent automation improves operational performance and efficiency in networks that include our products’ ability to optimize the network at the application layer, enabling our products to enhance network performance.
 
Point-to-Point (PTP) fixed wireless backhaul
 Our PTP solutions are typically connected to high-speed, high-bandwidth wireline or fiber networks, and provide wireless broadband backhaul to a facility, a networked device, or to a PMP access point. Our PTP solutions can be deployed throughout a network over distances of more than 100 kilometers and provide speeds greater than 5 Gbps.
We offer PTP solutions that are designed to operate in unlicensed spectrum from 220 MHz to 5.9 GHz and 57 to 66 GHz, and in licensed spectrum from 6-38 and 71-86 GHz. In addition, our PTP 700 operates in NATO Band IV from 4.4-5.9 GHz, as well as in the 7 GHz and 8 GHz bands, and meets stringent federal operating, performance, and security standards. The mainstay of our backhaul offering is the PTP 670 for commercial applications and PTP 700 for defense and national security applications. In addition, our PTP 820 and 850 series offers carrier-grade microwave backhaul in licensed spectrum, and our PTP 550 offers price-performance leadership in spectral efficiency in sub-6 GHz unlicensed spectrum.
In addition to dedicated point-to-point platforms, as technology has evolved, solutions have developed that while principally supporting point-to-multi-point architectures, also support point-to-point applications, including the recently introduced 60 GHz cnWave V3000 and the ePMP Force 425. Revenues from these products are included in the PMP product category in our revenues by product category reporting, as that is their primary application.
 Point-to-Multipoint (PMP) fixed wireless
Our PMP solutions extend wireless broadband access from tower mounted FWB access points to customer premise equipment (CPE) providing broadband access to residences and enterprises covering wide areas with a range of 10 to 30 kilometers. Our PMP solutions are increasingly used to backhaul video surveillance systems and public Wi-Fi.
Our PMP portfolio ranges from our PMP 450 series to our ePMP solutions for network operators that need to optimize for both price and performance to our cnReach family of narrow-bandwidth connectivity products for industrial communications. The PMP 450 series is optimized for performance in high-density and demanding physical environments, and includes the PMP 450m with integrated cnMedusa massive multi-user multiple input/multiple output, or MU-MIMO, technology. The PMP 450 product line also supports the FCC’s Citizen Broadband Radio Service, or CBRS. The FCC completed the auction of CBRS Priority Access Licenses, or PAL, in the third quarter of 2020, complementing the existing availability of General Authorized Access, or GAA, licenses. Network operators are adopting the PMP 450 solution to exercise both PAL and GAA licenses.
For less demanding environments, ePMP provides a high-quality platform at a more affordable price. The ePMP 3000 supports 4x4 MU-MIMO and is complemented by a broad portfolio of ePMP Force 300 subscriber radios. In December 2022, we commenced commercial shipment of the ePMP 4600 series, which utilizes the 6 GHz band, expected to be commercially released by the FCC and other regulatory bodies around the world in 2023.
cnRanger, our Fixed LTE solution, operated in the 2 GHz (Bands 38, 40, 41) and 3 GHz (Bands 42, 43, 48). Like the PMP 450 platform, the 3 GHz cnRanger solution supports the CBRS service, while the 2 GHz bands support the FCC’s Educational Broadband Service, or EBS, classification.
Our cnReach IIoT solutions offer connectivity for distributed sensors and controls across industrial deployments, delivering real-time monitoring, measurement and analytics to optimize system performance. Our products can be deployed in a variety of industrial verticals such as oil and gas, electrical utilities, water management, rail and transportation operations and smart cities. cnReach focuses on SCADA systems for process control and monitoring, providing affordable, narrowband wireless connectivity, operating below 1 GHz, to support distribution automation, substation switches, circuit control and telemetry.
 In the fourth quarter of 2020, we began shipping our 60 GHz solution, cnWave, which enables Gbps networking using the 60 GHz band and a distributed architecture that enables scaled networks with dynamic routing for reliability and resiliency.
In 2022, we commenced commercial shipments of 28 GHz cnWave 5G Fixed, which operates in the 3GPP n257 (26.50 – 29.50 GHz), n258 (24.25 – 27.50 GHz), and n261 (27.50 – 28.35 GHz) bands. The platform incorporates both uplink and downlink MU-MIMO to optimize data rate to the CPE for residential and enterprise customers.
 Enterprise solutions
 Our Enterprise portfolio includes our cloud-managed Wi-Fi solutions, our cnMatrix cloud-managed wireless-aware switching solution, our Xirrus Wi-Fi solutions, and our Wi-Fi 6 portfolio of Wi-Fi 6 access points which support both cnMaestro and Xirrus XMS management.
Our enterprise-grade Wi-Fi 6/6E solutions provide distributed access to individual users or devices in indoor settings, such as office complexes, and outdoor settings, such as private spaces and outdoor public Wi-Fi hotspots, over distances from two meters to 1 kilometer with high capacity. Our Wi-Fi access point portfolio includes solutions enterprise, government, education, small business and home applications and offers a range of Wi-Fi access points and RF technology that enable network optimization based on desired geographic coverage and user density.
In June 2020, we introduced our first Wi-Fi 6 access point, the XV3-8, which supports both cnPilot and Xirrus solutions. In 2021 and 2022 we continued to extend our Wi-Fi 6/6E portfolio, including the addition of the XE5-8, a ﬁve-radio Wi-Fi 6/6E 8×8/4×4 access point (AP) designed to deliver high-density, future-proof performance for building next generation wireless networks. With ﬁve user servicing radios, the XE5-8 delivers the highest density Wi-Fi 6 solution in the industry. Wi-Fi 6E support extends the capacity of Wi-Fi into the 6 GHz band, more than tripling the wireless spectrum available. In 2022, we also introduced the XV2-22H Wi-Fi 6 Wall Plate Access Point. The XV2-22H indoor Wi-Fi 6 AP offers 2.97 Gbps of bandwidth and an integrated switch. Ideal for hospitality, MDU, education, and small/medium business applications.

Ethernet Switches
Our cnMatrix Ethernet enterprise switching solutions simplify network deployment and operation. cnMatrix provides the intelligent interface between wireless and wired networks. cnMatrix’s policy-based automation (PBA) accelerates network deployment, mitigates human error, increases security, and improves reliability. When deployed with Cambium Networks Wi-Fi access points and the cnMaestro management system, network operators have an affordable, feature-rich, high-quality unified wired/wireless enterprise grade network. In the first quarter of 2021, we introduced and began shipping the cnMatrix TX 2020R-P. The TX 2020R-P is the first of a series of switches designed specifically to support PMP and PTP fixed wireless broadband networks, incorporating the cnMatrix enterprise-class feature set and incorporating additional features and services pertinent to network operators deploying fixed wireless broadband networks. The TX 2012R-P was introduced in April 2021 and is the second platform in the TX series.
Network Management Platform
 Our cloud-based cnMaestro and cnMaestro X network management platform provide users with an integrated, intelligent, easy to use tool for end-to-end network management of our portfolio from the network operating center to be managed to the edge of the network by an individual CPE. cnMaestro’s interface allows users to easily onboard large numbers of new devices, configure existing devices, monitor the entire network and troubleshoot.
We have recently introduced two subscription services that complement and rely on cnMaestro: Network Service Edge (NSE 3000), and Quality of Experience (QoE). Network Service Edge delivers advanced security, network, and SD-WAN services for small and medium enterprise networks. These services are integrated into Cambium’s ONE Network solution that enables organizations to deploy and manage security policies across the wireless and wired network, all fully managed and controlled as part of a single framework.
Our QoE solution is hardware agnostic, operating across both wireless and fiber networks, and offers a range of services to network operators utilizing our networking solutions as well as third-party competitive offerings. The subscription-based solution includes granular application shaping, dynamic queue-based rate limiting, congestion management and application insights, which provides broadband service providers immediate access to the information and controls to optimize end user experiences and be the service provider of choice.
 Our network planning tools include cnHeat and LINKPlanner. cnHeat is a network planning subscription service that provides a heat map coverage model display of locations that are available for FWB connectivity that aids in network planning. cnHeat utilizes LiDAR or equivalent geospatial data to accurately model the geography being evaluated, coupled with highly accurate RF modeling, to render a visual and quantitative assessment of anticipated RF coverage and performance. cnHeat allows network operators to optimize site selection for coverage, supporting their total cost of ownership and return on investment. LINKPlanner is a comprehensive tool, developed over the past 12 years, used to plan PTP and PMP networks. LINKPlanner allows users to visualize and analyze hypothetical network deployment scenarios to evaluate performance and reliability allowing for cost-effective expansion and deployment of their networks. cnArcher is a smartphone app that accelerates installation and deployment of our fixed wireless products by field technicians.
 Sales and marketing
 We sell our products primarily through a network of distributors who sell to other channel partners, including value-added resellers, system integrators, and end customers (end users), as well as through our direct sales force. End users include public or private network operators, including broadband and/or wireless LAN managed service providers; broadband internet service providers; mobile network operators; mid-market enterprises, such as education, hospitality, multi-dwelling units, and retail; state and local government; industrial, including energy, mining, rail operators and utilities; and military agencies. Channel partners may work directly with end users to identify their networking needs and they may also provide installation, configuration, and ongoing support services. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 12,600 channel partners, which includes over 160 distributors.
Our sales organization typically engages directly with large Internet service providers and enterprise managed service providers and certain enterprises even though product fulfillment generally is provided by our channel partners. We also engage in joint selling and marketing with our service provider, system integrator, and reseller channel partners to their customers’ end users. Our sales organization includes field and inside sales personnel, as well as regional technical managers with deep technical expertise who are responsible for pre-sales technical support and solutions engineering for internet service providers, enterprise networking managed service providers, systems integrators and resellers. As of December 31, 2022, we had 134 sales personnel located in 20 countries.
 Our distributors play a central role by promoting and distributing our products in target vertical markets, providing value-added support to the service providers and reseller channels by bringing core strengths in technical support and professional services. This is in addition to logistics, and sales and marketing support. Our distributors typically stock and manage inventory of our products.
 We typically work with channel partners through our Connected Partner program, which is a structured program designed to support and enable partners to sell and support our products. The program includes training and education, marketing support,
technical support, and other resources such as product discounts, deal registration, demonstration equipment, virtual and in-person events, and promotions to help channel partners succeed in selling and supporting our products.
Our marketing activities can be Cambium Networks led as well as distributor or channel partner led. Our marketing activities are focused on building brand awareness and generating leads with our target market segments of service providers, enterprise, industrial, and government. In addition, we work with our distributors and other channel partners to enable joint marketing that targets the enterprise end users. We leverage a broad mix of communications platforms including website and social media presence, public relations, webinars, trade shows and private events.
Customer support
 We provide multiple layers of support: technical support, information-sharing with an experienced community of users, software downloads, warranty services, and repair. We support our enterprise class solutions with a range of flexible service plans and optional 24/7 availability that provide assurance to network operators that their always-on, mission critical communications requirements will be met. With every product purchase, we provide technical support on a best-effort basis. Hardware issues are diagnosed via joint troubleshooting with the end user, and the issue will be addressed according to standard warranty status and the root cause of the issue. This may be sufficient for some customers who can largely manage and operate their network without assistance and hold adequate spares. For others, we provide three support programs staffed by our skilled technical support team and product support engineers to keep the network operating smoothly and efficiently and may provide 24x7x365 technical support and premium warranty support and allow network operators to select the service level that best meets their needs. Our support organization both supports channel partners in supporting their direct customers and provides first-line support to our direct customers. Technical support is also available on-line via chat and automated ticketing systems.
Training
 We provide a wide range of training and educational material, from comprehensive user guides and installation guides, to self-directed interactive training, to in-person instructor-led immersion courses to ensure our end-users and channel partners are familiar with the design, implementation, usage, and management of our products. The training and certification system is administered through a learning management system that provides the user a record of course work, exam results, certifications and access to on-demand self-directed training resources that complement instructor-led sessions scheduled frequently around the world.
Cambium Community Forum
 The Cambium Networks Community Forum is a platform for users of our solutions to connect with each other, ask questions, and share information and experiences. It is a place where users can find help and support, as well the latest developments and features of Cambium Networks products. The forum is also a place where users can share their own tips and best practices for using our products, and where they can stay up to date with the latest news and updates from us.
Our Community Forum is moderated by our staff with direct and active engagement by our development engineering and product management personnel. Leveraging the Community Forum, we collect network operator and channel partner feedback on potential product improvements and new product ideas, including through the administration of beta testing on our products. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 46,000 registered forum members on our Community Forum.
 Manufacturing and supply
 We rely on third-party contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers for our manufacturing requirements. Our global sourcing strategy emphasizes the procurement of materials and product manufacturing in competitive geographies. For some of our products, we do substantially all of the design work; for other products, we outsource both the design (in whole or in part) and the manufacture of the product; and for several products we distribute and sell a product designed and manufactured by a third party under our name on a white label basis. We generally require that the manufacturing processes and procedures are certified to International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 9001 standards.
Our third-party manufacturers typically procure the components needed to build our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. Generally, for our primary third-party manufacturers, we update these forecasts monthly. This allows us to leverage the purchasing power of our third-party manufacturers. Our products rely on key components, purchased from a limited number of suppliers, including certain sole source providers. Lead times for materials and components vary significantly, and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, complexity, contract terms, demand and availability of a component at a given time. From time to time, we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple qualified sources or where our suppliers are geographically concentrated. We, like the rest of our industry, have experienced shortages in semiconductors and other key components used for our hardware, which have driven increased costs for components and shipping. To alleviate shortages, we have and may continue to purchase certain scarce components directly on the open market. We may also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints and enter
into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of supply. In periods of shortages, we have in the past and may in the future need to build inventory of select components.
We outsource the warehousing and delivery of our products at these fulfillment facilities to a third-party logistics provider for worldwide fulfillment. Our direct fulfillment facilities are in Louisville, Kentucky, Venlo, Netherlands and Shanghai, China from where we ship to our distributor partners and network operators.
 Research and development
 Our research and development organization is located primarily in San Jose and Thousand Oaks, California, Rolling Meadows, Illinois, Ashburton, United Kingdom and Bangalore, India. We also work with contract engineers in various locations globally. Our research and development team has deep expertise and experience in wireless technology, antenna design and network architecture and operation. We expect to continue to expand our product offerings and solutions capabilities in the future and to invest significantly in continued research and development efforts.
Intellectual property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our core technology and innovations. We rely on federal, state, common law and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties, such as Internet service providers, vendors, individuals and entities that may be exploring a business relationship with us. In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and England and in certain other locations outside of these jurisdictions. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available.
 We seek patent protection for certain of our key innovations, protocols, processes and other inventions. As of December 31, 2022, we had 42 issued U.S. patents and 149 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as 9 U.S. and 41 foreign patent applications pending. We file patent applications in the United States and other countries where we believe there to be a strategic technological or business reason to do so. Although we actively attempt to utilize patents to protect our technologies, we believe that none of our patents, individually, are material to our business.
 Competition
 The markets for FWB and Enterprise solutions are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. We compete in a wide range of related categories, each with its set of competitors worldwide that vary in size and in the products and solutions offered. We expect competition to persist, intensify and increase in the future. We review our competitive situation as follows:
 •Our cnMaestro network management solution has the ability to manage both FWB edge networking devices (e.g., Wi-Fi, switching), and quality of experience and network security services, in a coordinated and centralized manner. In addition, its northbound APIs enable operators to integrate specialized services on top of their Cambium Networks infrastructure. As networks become more diverse and complex, cnMaestro’s capability will increasingly become a competitive strength.
 •Our competitors for products and solutions for unlicensed wireless broadband in the sub-7 GHz spectrum bands include Ubiquiti, Tarana, Airspan, Radwin, MikroTik, Ligowave, and HFCL Group. Competitors in the 3.5 GHz spectrum band, the Citizens Broadband Radio Service in FCC-governed markets, include Airspan, but also Ericsson, Nokia, Baicells, and Telrad. Our cnWave 60 GHz mmWave point-to-point and point-to-multi-point products compete with Ubiquiti, MikroTik, Siklu, Adtran, and Edgecore. 
 •The landscape for broadband services using licensed spectrum is different. Our competitors in the licensed point-to-point microwave market include Aviat Networks, Ceragon, SIAE, NEC, and SAF Technica, among others. Our cnWave 5G fixed (28 GHz) products compete with Intracom, Ericsson, Nokia, and Samsung. 
 •Our home Wi-Fi routers are offered to subscribers by our fixed wireless service provider customers. These devices compete with all consumer-grade, home Wi-Fi brands.
 •Broadband service providers are increasingly finding the need to manage network performance at the application level. An example is prioritizing Netflix vs. online game download vs. Zoom. We offer a subscription to a cloud-based tool that enables operators to accomplish this task regardless of the hardware deployed (it works with our equipment as well as equipment by other manufacturers in the network). Competitors to this offering include Preseem, and Sandvine (including Prosera Analytics which was purchased by Sandvine).

•Our cnReach narrowband fixed wireless IIoT products and solutions compete principally with GE MDS and Freewave. 
 •The success of a FWB network is highly dependent on accurately predicting the performance of each link before it is deployed. We offer a subscription to a cloud-based tool called cnHeat which leverages LiDAR data to build highly accurate link forecasts. The primary competitor to cnHeat is TowerCoverage.com. There are also offerings for LiDAR heatmaps from Google and Cloud RF.
 •Our enterprise network edge solutions, which include Wi-Fi, cnMatrix ethernet switching, and Network Services Edge (NSE) products compete with a wide range of competitors, in some cases the competitor competing with two or more of our products. Ruckus (CommScope), Ubiquiti, Meraki (Cisco), Extreme Networks, Aruba (HPE), Fortinet, Mist (Juniper), and Ruiji, are competitors to our Wi-Fi Access Point portfolio. Our cnMatrix wireless aware ethernet switch platform competes with Ubiquiti, MikroTik, Cisco, and HPE, among others. Our cnMaestro X network management solution competes with each competitive manufacturers’ management platform at a device-level, but also with system-level solutions developed in-house, or commercial solutions.
 As our target markets continue to develop and expand, and as the technology for wireless broadband and enterprise networking continues to evolve, we expect competition to increase from both established and emerging market participants.
The market for our products and solutions is influenced by a variety of factors, including the following:
 •Total cost of ownership and return on investment associated with the solutions;
 •Ease of configuration, installation, and use of the solution;
 •Ability to provide a backward compatible solution;
 •Broad application across a range of use cases and frequencies;
 •Product quality, functionality and reliability;
 •Ability to allow centralized management of the solutions to enable better network planning, including scalable provisioning, configuration, monitoring and complete network visualization;
 •Ability to enable operators to profitably compete on both price and service levels and
 •Ability to provide quality, full service pre- and post-sales product support.
 We believe we compete favorably on each of these factors.
 Regulatory requirements
 In addition to regulations of general application to global businesses, we are subject to a number of regulatory requirements specific to our industry, including, without limitation:
 •Radio frequency usage. Because our products transmit energy in RF spectrum, our products are subject to:
 ▪rules relating to RF spectrum allocation and authorization of certain radio equipment issued by the Federal Communications Commission for non-federal uses or the National Telecommunications and Information Administration for federal uses; and 
 ▪local type approval, or homologation, rules requiring confirmation that our products meet minimum regulatory, technical and safety requirements prior to sale in various countries around the world, for example: European Technical Standards Institute (ETSI), Industry Canada (IC) and Agencia National De Telecommunicatoes (Anatel). 
 The applicable regulatory agencies in each jurisdiction adopt regulations to manage spectrum use, establish and enforce priorities among competing uses, limit harmful radio frequency interference and promote policy goals such as broadband deployment. These spectrum regulations regulate allocation, licensing, and equipment authorizations. Since our customers purchase devices to operate in specific spectrum bands allocated by the regulatory authorities, our products must meet the technical requirements set forth for such spectrum allocation(s).
 In some bands, the operator, such as our customer, must seek prior regulatory authority to operate using specified frequencies, and the resulting spectrum license authorizes the licensee, for a limited term, to operate in a spectrum consistent with licensed technical parameters within a specified geographic area. We must design and manufacture our products to comply with these technical parameters.
 Our products generally are subject to compliance testing prior to approval, and, as a condition of authority in each jurisdiction, we must ensure that our products have the proper labels and documentation specifying such authority. We generally use
telecommunications certification bodies to obtain certification for our devices in each jurisdiction in which we intend to market and sell our products.
•Trade compliance requirements. We are subject to compliance with rules in jurisdictions from which we export or into which we import our products, including export control and reporting, import clearance, anti-bribery, antitrust and competition rules and regulations, including:
 •Import and export requirements issued by the United States, the European Union or other jurisdictions, including, for example, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, Ministry of Defense and Department of International Trade including rules banning sales to persons or entities on applicable designated parties lists, or to persons or entities in embargoed countries, rules requiring export licenses prior to sales of products incorporating encryption technology to certain end users, and local rules governing import of products, including packaging and labeling laws.

 Human capital management
 We pride ourselves on developing and maintaining a strong reputation for innovation and integrity and conduct our business affairs honestly and in an ethical manner. We are proud to be named by Built In Chicago as one of the 100 best large companies to work for in Chicago in 2022. We expect our corporate culture to embody trust and respect for individuals, teamwork and innovation; Cambium is a place where employees are proud to work, and where customers, suppliers and partners want to work with us. One of
our most valuable assets is our integrity. We are guided by our core values of growth and profitability; outstanding global teamwork; relentless innovation and edge; making and meeting commitments; respecting and developing our people; and serving our community.
We are focused on hiring, training, and retaining exceptional talent. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 650 full-time employees, of whom 419 are located outside the United States. None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In certain foreign jurisdictions, where required by local law or custom, some of our employees are represented by local workers’ councils and/or industry collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. We have a broad base of diverse talent in more than 20 countries and we believe that attracting, developing and retaining the best talent is critical to our success and achievement of our strategic objectives.
We appreciate one another’s differences and strengths and are proud that our workforce comprises employees with a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives. Diversity, inclusion and belonging have long been a part of our culture, and we work to continually expand our diversity, inclusion and belonging initiatives and to conform to the principles of equal opportunity. We do not discriminate based on race, religion, national origin, disability, medical condition, marital status, sex, gender, age, military or veteran status, sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic as established by federal, state or local laws. Further, we have policies in place that prohibit harassment of all kinds and we prohibit retaliation in all forms and are committed to encouraging a culture where employees can freely ask questions and raise concerns.
Although we are working in both remote and hybrid environments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we work collaboratively, without hierarchy, and our management team is readily available to all employees, with additional quarterly global town hall events that allow for open question and answer dialogue.
 We offer what we believe is a competitive compensation package, tailored to the job function and geography of each employee. Our team is global, and we offer competitive and meaningful compensation and benefits programs that meet the diverse needs of our employees, while also reflecting local market practices. Our U.S. benefits plan includes health benefits, life and disability insurance, various voluntary insurances, flexible time off and leave programs, an employee assistance plan, an educational assistance policy, and a 401(k) plan with a competitive employer match. Our international benefits plans are competitive locally and generally provide similar benefits. We believe our compensation structure aligns with our shareholders’ long-term interests by balancing profitability and growth, as well as current market practices, and reflects our commitment to pay for performance. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology space is intense, and our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees and their well-being, offering competitive compensation and benefits, promoting diversity and inclusion, adopting progressive human capital management practices and community outreach constitute core elements of our corporate strategy. In addition to competitive salaries and bonuses or sales commissions, we offer a robust employment total rewards package that promotes employee well-being and includes health care, extended parental leave, and paid time off, including extended leave for new parents (moms, dads and partners) to care for a newborn or newly adopted child.
 We also offer rewards and recognition programs to our employees, including peer-led recognition of employees who best exemplify our values. We believe that these recognition programs help drive strong employee performance. We conduct annual employee performance reviews, where each employee is evaluated by their manager as well as a self-assessment. Employee performance is assessed based on a variety of key performance metrics, including the achievement of corporate objectives and objectives specific to the employee’s department or role.
 We grant equity-based compensation to many of our employees and have extended the opportunity for equity ownership through our employee share purchase plan in the United States, the United Kingdom and India. Additionally, we offer benefits to support our employees’ physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health and encourage healthy behaviors and facilitate a number of employee support groups.
