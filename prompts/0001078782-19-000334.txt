ITEM 1 BUSINESS.
Corporate History
 
Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc. (“TSI” or the “Company”) was organized August 6, 2007 under the name Friendly Auto Dealers, Inc., under the laws of the State of Nevada. In the first quarter of 2011 the Company changed its name from Friendly Auto Dealers, Inc. to Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc., and acquired Splint Decisions, Inc., a California corporation.
 
Currently the Company is focused on immune modulation for the treatment of several specific diseases. Immune modulation refers to the ability to upregulate (make more active) or downregulate (make less active) one’s immune system.
 
Activating one’s immune system is now an accepted method to cure certain cancers, reduce recovery time from viral or bacterial infections and to prevent illness. Additionally, inhibiting one’s immune system is vital for reducing inflammation, autoimmune disorders and allergic reactions.
 
TSI is developing a range of immune-modulatory agents to target certain cancers, improve maternal and fetal health, fight periodontal disease, and for daily health. 
 
Nutraceutical Division – TSI has been producing high quality nutraceuticals. Its flagship product, ProJuvenol®, is a proprietary mixture containing pterostilbene – one of the most potent antioxidants known. TSI filed a patent application for ProJuvenol® on 07-08-2015 titled: “Augmentation of Oncology Immunotherapies by Pterostilbene Containing Compositions” and was granted that patent on June 20, 2017.
 
Emvolio, Inc., – was a wholly-owned subsidiary of TSI, incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 3, 2016, for the purpose of filing an Investigation New Drug (“IND”) application with the FDA for our StemVacs immunotherapy vaccine. In May of 2018 President Donald J. Trump signed into the law, the Right To Try bill. Because of this change, Emvolio has decided to withdraw the IND for a Phase 1 trial in the USA because TSI had previously completed a 10 patient trial in Mexico. TSI has since generated Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) documentation for the previously treated 10 patients into a Phase I trial, which will be presented to the FDA by TSI as part of an Ex-US trial compliant with 21 CFR 312.120 Foreign clinical studies not conducted under an IND. Therefore we have dissolved Emvolio, Inc. as it is no longer needed.
SandBox Dental Labs, Inc. – is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TSI consisting of a future dental laboratory to manufacture and fill prescriptions from dentists who will use our proprietary Sleep Appliance to treat their patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. The Company needs to seek regulatory approval for its device to treat sleep apnea. As of December 31, 2018 and April 1, 2019, formal operations have not commenced.
 
Management does not expect existing cash as of December 31, 2018 or as of March 31, 2019 to be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations for at least twelve months from the issuance date of these December 31, 2018 financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has incurred losses totaling $7.1 million since inception, has not yet generated material revenue from operations, and will require additional funds to maintain its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. The Company intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months through its existing financial resources and we may also raise additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and/or licensing arrangements. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or curtail, our operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Nutraceutical Patents:
 
TSOI filed a patent in July 2015 covering the use of its ProJuvenol® product, as well as various pterostilbene compositions, for use in augmenting efficacy of existing immuno-oncology drugs that are currently on the market. The patent is based on the ability of pterostilbene, one of the major ingredients of ProJuvenol®, to reduce oxidative stress produced by cancer cells, which in turn protects the immune system from cancer mediated immune suppression. That patent, U.S. No.: 9,682,047 was granted on 6-20-2017.
 
In addition, on April 28, 2016 the Company filed a patent application covering the use of ProJuvenol© and its active ingredient pterostilbene for augmentation of stem cell activity. Diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by deficient stem cell activity. The patent covers the stimulation of stem cells that already exist in the patient’s body, as well as stem cells that are administered therapeutically.
 
Studies have shown that patients who have higher levels of endogenous stem cell activity have reduced cardiovascular disease risk and undergo accelerated neurological recovery after stroke as compared to patients with lower numbers of such stem cells.
 
On October 16, 2017 the Company filed a patent application titled "Synergistic Inhibition of Glioma Using Pterostilbene and Analogues Thereof" which was developed to utilize the ability of the immune system to augment the possibility of increasing overall survival of glioma patients after treatment with conventional therapies. Our data suggests that when pterostilbene is combined with brain cancer therapeutics such as Gefitinib, Sertraline, or Temozolomide, the prognosis is vastly improved.
 
On August 13, 2018 the company filed a patent application titled “Enhancement of Ozone Therapy using Pterostilbene” showing pterostilbene potently augments killing of breast cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer cells by ozone therapy. The data obtained is an extension of ongoing work at the Company seeking to identify means of enhancing the effects of pterostilbene administration for treatment of a variety of cancers, as well as enhancing the efficacy of existing cancer therapies.

On September 17, 2018 the company filed a patent application titled “Pterostilbene and Compositions Thereof for Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy” with new data demonstrating the ability of its NeuroStilbene intranasal formulation of pterostilbene to successfully prevent the development of brain injury in an animal model of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy aka CTE.
 
On September 25, 2018 the company filed a patent application titled “Pterostilbene and Formulations Thereof for Treatment of Pathological Immune Activation” covering novel clinical data using its NanoStilbene™ formulation to reduce inflammatory cytokine production in cancer patients.
 
The Star Ingredient is Pterostilbene
 
Pterostilbene, (trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxystilbene) is a stilbene compound that is structurally similar to other popular stilbenes such as resveratrol or piceatannol; it is named after its first discovered source (the pterocarpus genus) but is also a component of blueberries and grape products. It is a phytoalexin (compound produced by plants as a defense against parasites and insects) similar to resveratrol albeit more potent.
 
Pterostilbene has been found to be significantly more stable in vivo than resveratrol, its half-life in vivo is approximately 104 minutes versus resveratrol, for 13 minutes. Further, studies indicate that the body better absorbs pterostilbene than resveratrol, and pterostilbene is more biologically active than resveratrol, and is more efficacious than resveratrol in inhibiting certain biological activities including pro-inflammatory enzymes (providing anti-inflammatory benefits), and cell membranes producing lipid peroxidation (providing anti-oxidant support).
 
Each of the benefits below are specifically a growing concern within our targeted demographics, the availability of a natural product to the existing medical protocols provides a logical and affordable alternative, without many of the adverse side effects of traditional medicines.
 

Reduced insulin sensitivity 
 
Reduction in VLDL and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels 
 
Increasing HDL (good) cholesterol levels 
 
Positive vascular smooth muscle cells 
 
Anti-inflammatory benefits 
 
Anti-oxidant benefits 
 
Cognitive function improvement 
 
Skin protection from Ultra Violet light exposure

Superoxide dismutase, (SOD) an essential enzyme found in all living cells, it is a powerful cellular protector which helps break down potentially harmful oxygen molecules in cells, assisting in the prevention of damage to tissues. Green coffee bean extract, which contains antioxidant polyphenols and plant compounds that help support a variety of biological processes including fat and glucose metabolism. ProJuvenol® uses the only known, patented coated source of Superoxide dismutase, to ensure that your body has the ability to absorb and utilize this ingredient. Uncoated versions of SOD have not been shown to be effective when taken orally, ProJuvenol® does not include ingredients that are not shown to possess the ability to convey the benefits attributable to that ingredient.
 
DMAE, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, an ingredient known to help promote choline production, which is required for healthy neurological and cognitive function. DMAE has been shown to have the ability to scavenge specific types of free radicals, it is also has been shown to assist in improving memory and mood; boosting thinking skills and intelligence; and increasing physical energy, oxygen efficiency, athletic performance, and muscle reflexes. It may also assist in preventing aging or liver spots, improving red blood cell function, and extending life span.
 
Piperine for bio-enhanced nutrient absorption. Piperine has been clinically tested in the United States. Piperine significantly enhances the bioavailability of various supplement nutrients through increased absorption. We have included this in ProJuvenol® because we believe that it significantly increases the absorption of the amazing active ingredients found in ProJuvenol®.
 
Curcumin is an anti-inflammatory molecule in the turmeric root, a relative of ginger.
 

NanoStilbene is prepared by low-energy emulsification which allows for better solubility, stability, and the release performance of pterostilbene nanoparticles. The pterostilbene placed in a nanoemulsion droplet is free from air, light, and hard environment; therefore, as a delivery system, nanoemulsion can not only improve the bioavailability of pterostilbene but also protect it from oxidation and hydrolysis, while it possesses an ability of sustained release at the same time. The recommended dose is 1.5 milliliters yielding 300 milligrams per dose. In addition to the benefits of the nanoparticle pterostilbene we chose to use medium chain triglycerides (MCT), derived from coconut oil, as one of our oil mediums in preparing the nanoemulsion. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
MCTs are not stored as fat, but rather convert quickly into Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy for the body and brain at the cellular level.
 
MCT’s are also shown to increase metabolic thermo-genesis, improve stamina, endurance, athletic performance, and energy levels, as well as exhibiting potent anti-microbial properties – providing immune system benefits and helping in balancing candida in the gut.
 
NanoStilbene is available in 60ml bottles at a concentration of 200mg per ml with a recommended daily dose of 1.5ml which is equal to 300mg.
 
Nanotechnology
 
Therapeutic uses of nanotechnology typically involve the delivery of small-molecule drugs, peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids. Nanoparticles have advanced pharmacological effects compared with the therapeutic entities they contain. Active intracellular delivery and improved pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug nanoparticles depend on various factors, including their size and surface properties.
 
Nanoparticle therapeutics is an emerging treatment modality in cancer and other inflammatory disorders. The National Cancer Institute has recognized nanotechnology as an emerging field with the potential to revolutionize modern medicine for detection, treatment, and prevention of cancer.
 
On May 15, 2018 TSI announced Institutional Review Board (IRB) clearance to initiate a pilot pharmacokinetic trial of “NanoStilbene.” Then on July 02, 2018 the Company announced receiving pilot clinical data providing proof of concept that NanoStilbene more effectively increases blood levels of the molecule as compared to conventional formulations. The clinical trial involved the administration of NanoStilbene in comparison to powder in capsule form pterostilbene with healthy volunteers, whom underwent a series of blood draws to determine the concentration of the compound.

NanoStilbene Administration Results in Superior Pharmacokinetic Profile 
 Compared to Pterostilbene Administration
 
Blood was collected in EDTA tubes and plasma collected subsequent to centrifugation at 700g for 10 minutes. Collection time points were prior to administration of test compound, as well as at times 2hr, 4hr, 6hr, 8hr, 10hr, and 12 hrs. Test compounds were 10 ml of NanoStilbene (provided by Therapeutic Solutions International) and 6 capsules of 50 mg pterostilbene (VitaMonk). A wash out period of 3 days was allowed between two test compound administration. 
Results
 
The results were that at peak concentration NanoStilbene (Square) had a 55% increase in serum levels over the traditional powder (Triangle) form of pterostilbene. The data also shows the half-life to be double to that of the powder form.
 
The data in Granted U.S. Patent No.: 9,682,047 strongly suggest that pterostilbene administration may be an inexpensive and safe method of augmenting efficacy of numerous immunotherapeutic drugs. Although cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized the prognosis of many patients, the majority of patients still possess poor or suboptimal responses to this approach.
 
Clinical Trial of NanoStilbene for Immune Derepression in Advanced Cancer
 Patients
 
Twelve advanced cancer patients were recruited for the study. All patients signed informed consent and were told of the investigational nature of the clinical trial. To be eligible patients must have at least 6 months life expectancy, ECOG over 2, metastatic advanced solid tumor, be ambulatory, and not suffer organ failure. Characteristics of the patients is described in Table 1.
 
NanoStilbene
 
NanoStilbene, was administered at a concentration of 10 ml orally per day (300mg) for a total of three weeks. Administration was performed by the patients at home and patients were instructed to note the time of dose intake as well as any side effects associated with ingestion. Patients were also instructed to ingest NanoStilbene on a full stomach.
 
Results
 
The study assessed whether the administration of NanoStilbene, a nanoformulation of pterostilbene, is effective at reducing inflammatory markers and augmenting immune function in 12 advanced cancer patients.
 
It has previously been known that pterostilbene possesses direct anticancer activity in the majority of cancers including melanoma1, glioma2, ovarian cancer3, prostate cancer4, pancreatic cancer5, breast cancer6, liver cancer7, colorectal cancer8, and various liquid tumors (leukemias)9.
 
Chronic inflammation, as measured by CRP, TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels in the blood, has been reported to be immune suppressive in cancer patients and we sought to reduce them through orally administered NanoStilbene. On average we saw CRP reduced by 27%, Interleukin 6 (IL-6) by 26% and TNF-alpha also by 26%. This dramatic reduction showed clinically relevant levels of downregulation of inflammatory cytokines as a result of the NanoStilbene administration.

The suppression of interferon gamma (IFN-g) is a hallmark of cancer immune evasion. Given that this cancer immune evasion is typically associated with inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha, we assessed the impact of NanoStilbene administration on the production of interferon gamma. We observed an average increase by 12% among the patients treated. The augmentation of interferon gamma production was due to the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines CRP, TNF-a, and IL-6.
 
The augmentation of natural killer cell (NK) activity is one of the most sensitive indicators of anticancer immunity seen clinically. Previous studies have shown that efficacy of antibody, as well as chemotherapy-induced cancer cell death, is dependent on NK activity. Unfortunately, cancer patients have suppressed NK activity, usually as a result of oxidative stress, therefore, it was postulated that NanoStilbene may reverse cancer associated NK depression. We observed on average an increase in NK activity of 37%, validating that 300mg of NanoStilbene daily was sufficient to cause these results.
 
These results suggest that NanoStilbene may be a useful adjuvant to immunotherapy of cancer rescuing T cell and NK cell activities. Augmentation of NK cell function may stimulate efficacy of approved therapies that depend on an active NK compartment such as Herceptin, Rituximab, and Cetuximab.

Dental

SandBox Dental Labs, Inc. – is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TSI consisting of a future dental laboratory to manufacture and fill prescriptions from dentists who will use our proprietary Sleep Appliance to treat their patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. The Company needs to seek regulatory approval for its device to treat sleep apnea. As of December 31, 2018 and April 1, 2019, formal operations have not commenced.
Immune-Oncology – Right To Try
 
In May of 2018 President Donald J. Trump signed into the law, the Right To Try bill. In 2015/2016 TSI began and completed a 10 patient clinical trial of advanced cancer patients in Mexico at the Pan Am Cancer Treatment Center located in Tijuan Mexico using our dendritic cell vaccine code named StemVacs. TSI has since generated GCP documentation for the previously treated 10 patients into a Phase I trial, which will be presented to the FDA by TSI as part of an Ex-US trial compliant with 21 CFR 312.120 Foreign clinical studies not conducted under an IND. This is a required step to conform to the new Right To Try law.
 
StemVacs is an immunotherapy platform that consists of 5 components. The overarching approach to the StemVacs Immunotherapy Platform is as follows: 
 
1.
Treat innate immune suppression: Administration of oral apigenin/NanoStilbene (Cancer DeTox Product) to decrease immune suppressive toxic molecules made by tumor and tumor microenvironment. 
 2.
Treat adaptive immune suppression: Administration of MemoryMune to activate dormant memory cells recognizing the tumor. Administration of LymphoBoost to repair deficient IL-12 production. 
 3.
Stimulation of immune response to cancer stem cells (StemVacs). 
 4.
Consolidation and maintenance of immunity: Cycles of StemVacs, supported by innaMune and LymphoBoost 
 
StemVacs: StemVacs is a subcutaneously administered vaccine comprised of immune stimulatory peptides resembling cancer stem cell specific proteins.

10



Cancer Metabolic DeTox: This is an orally administered agent that is derived from various herbs termed apigenin. The unique property of apigenin is that it inhibits a cancer associated metabolic pathway that degrades the amino acid tryptophan. Specifically, apigenin inhibits the enzyme indolamine 2,3 deoxygenase (IDO), which is responsible for breaking down tryptophan in the vicinity of the tumor and generating by-products such as kynurenine. It is known that immune activation is dependent on tryptophan being present in the tumor environment. The depletion of tryptophan and generation of kynurenine by tumor cells and tumor associated cells is a major cause of immune suppression in cancer. By administering Cancer Metabolic DeTox, the innate arm of the immune system has a chance to regenerate. This positions the patient for better outcome after administration of specific immune stimulating vaccines.
 
MemoryMune: This is a product derived from a two-step culture process of donor blood cells. The product MemoryMune reawakens dormant immune memory cells. It is known that many cancer patients possess memory T cells that enter the tumor, however, once inside the tumor these cells are inactivated. MemoryMune contains a unique combination of growth factors specific for immune system cells called “cytokines”. 
 
LymphoBoost: LymphoBoost is a proprietary formulation of Misoprostol, a drug approved for another indication, which we have shown to be capable of stimulating lymphocytes, particularly NK cells and T cells, both critical in maintaining anti-tumor immunity.
 
innaMune: This is a biological product derived from tissue culture of blood cells derived from healthy donors. It is a combination of cytokines that maintain activity of innate immune system cells, as well as having ability to shift M2 macrophages to M1.
 
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) – Right To Try
 
On December 10, 2018 Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc., announced the signing of an agreement between TSOI and Jadi Cell LLC for licensing of the Jadi Cell universal donor adult stem cell, as covered in US Patent No.: 9,803,176 B2 for use in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
 
The Jadi Cell product, which belongs to the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) family of cells, is a unique adult stem cell, which produces higher levels of therapeutic factors compared to other stem cells. The cells have demonstrated safety in animal models and pilot human trials. The Jadi Cell product is generated from umbilical cords, which are a source of medical waste and available in large quantities at inexpensive prices.
 
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is caused by repetitive concussive/sub-concussive hits to the head sustained over a period of years and is often found in football players. The condition is characterized by memory loss, impulsive/erratic behavior, impaired judgment, aggression, depression, and dementia. In many patients with CTE, it is anatomically characterized by brain atrophy, reduced mass of frontal and temporal cortices, and medial temporal lobe.
 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an insult to the brain, not of a degenerative or congenital nature, but caused by external physical force that may produce a diminished or altered state of consciousness, which results in an impairment of cognitive abilities or physical functioning.
 
CTE represents a significant unmet medical need which we believe is amenable to stem cell intervention. We are eager to accelerate treatments and potential cures for debilitating conditions such as CTE and traumatic brain injury and plan to leverage New regulatory pathways such as the recently approved “Right to Try” Law to deliver these medicines as soon as possible to patients which currently have no other options.
 
The Jadi Cell product because of its advanced stage of development in contrast to other stem cell types, which require years, if not decades of development before entry into American patients, will allow us we believe to be treating patients within 12 months. Currently means of isolating, producing, scaling up, and delivery of the cells has all been worked out by Jadi Cell and Collaborators.

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) revised the existing provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements and defined dietary supplements to include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary substances used to supplement diets. DSHEA generally provides a regulatory framework to help ensure safe, quality dietary supplements and the dissemination of accurate information about such products. The FDA is generally prohibited from regulating active ingredients in dietary supplements as drugs unless product claims, such as claims that a product may heal, mitigate, cure or prevent an illness, disease or malady, trigger drug status. 
 
The Company is also subject to a variety of other regulations in the United States, including those relating to taxes, labor and employment, import and export, and intellectual property. 


 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had three full-time employees, all non-union. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 
 
COMPETITION
 
The bio-technology, bio-pharma, and nutraceutical industries are subject to rapid technological change. Competition from domestic and foreign companies, large pharmaceutical companies and other interested businesses is intense and expected to increase. A number of companies with significantly greater resources are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals, biologics, and nutraceuticals in our targeted areas.
