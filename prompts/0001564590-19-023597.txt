Sales and Distribution 
 The Company markets its products exclusively in the United States, primarily through mass merchandisers and online marketplaces. 
 In fiscal 2019, Walmart accounted for approximately 50%, Amazon.com accounted for approximately 16%, and Fred Meyer accounted for approximately 13% of the Company’s net revenues. In fiscal 2018, Walmart accounted for approximately 62%, Amazon.com accounted for approximately 11%, and Fred Meyer accounted for approximately 11% of the Company’s net revenues. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues in either period. As a percent of the Company’s total trade accounts receivable, net of specific reserves, Walmart and Amazon.com accounted for 47% and 29% as of March 31, 2019, respectively. As a percent of the Company’s total trade accounts receivable, net of specific reserves, Walmart and Amazon.com accounted for 64% and 21% as of March 31, 2018, respectively. Management believes that a loss, or a significant reduction, of sales to any of its key customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. 
 Approximately 96% and 31% of the Company’s net revenues in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, were made through third-party sales representative organizations that receive sales commissions and work in conjunction with the Company’s own sales personnel. With the Company’s permission, third-party sales representative organizations may sell competitive products in addition to the Company’s products. In most instances, either party may terminate a sales representative relationship on 30 days prior notice by the Company and 90 days prior notice by the sales representative organization in accordance with customary industry practice. In fiscal 2019, the Company utilized 6 sales representative organizations, including one which represented approximately 55% of its net revenues and another which represented 32% of its net revenues. In fiscal 2018, the Company utilized 5 sales representative organizations, including one which represented approximately 26% of its net revenues. No other sales representative organization accounted for more than 10% of net revenues in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018. The remainder of the Company’s sales is to customers that are serviced by its sales personnel. The loss or reduction of product sales made through third party sales representative organizations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. Finding replacement organizations and distributors could be a time consuming process during which the Company’s revenues could be negatively impacted. 
 The Company primarily sells product to customers from its United States warehoused inventory, which is referred to as the Domestic Program. Under the Domestic Program, title for product typically passes at the time of shipment. The Company’s Direct Import Program allows its customers to import and receive product directly from an export port in the country of manufacture outside the United States. Under the Direct Import Program, title for the Company’s product passes to the customer in the country of origin when the product is shipped by the Company’s subsidiary in China. Under both programs, the Company recognizes revenues at the time title passes to the customer as this is when the Company satisfies its performance obligation under the contracts with its customers. See Item 7 — “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” During fiscal 2019 and 2018, less than 1% of the Company’s net product sales were sold under the Direct Import Program.
 During fiscal 2018, the Company initiated sales through third party online marketplaces to broaden its brand reach. The Company’s website also serves as a sales channel for products, and provides search capability, detailed product information, online merchant availability, demo videos and downloadable product specification sheets. Sales through Amazon.com accounted for approximately 16% and 11% of the Company’s net revenues in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company expects sales through online marketplaces to continue to be a growth initiative for its business.
 The Company has an integrated system to coordinate the purchasing, sales and distribution aspects of its operations. The Company receives orders from its major customers via electronic data interface, facsimile, telephone or mail. The Company does not have long-term contracts with any of its customers, but rather receives orders on an ongoing basis. Products imported by the Company for the Domestic Program, generally from factories in Asia, are shipped by ocean and/or inland freight and then stored in the Company’s outsourced warehouse facilities for shipment to customers. The Company monitors its inventory levels and goods in transit through the use of an electronic inventory system. When a purchase order under the Domestic Program is received, it is filled from the Company’s inventory and the warehoused product is labeled and prepared for outbound shipment to the customer by common, contract or small package carrier. 
 Licensing Activities 
 The Company is currently party to one license agreement with a third party licensee that allows the licensee to manufacture and/or sell various products bearing the Company’s trademarks into defined geographic areas. Such activities have had a positive impact on operating results by generating income with minimal incremental costs and without any working capital requirements. The Company has engaged Leveraged Marketing Corporation of America (“LMCA”) as an agent to assist in identifying and procuring licensing opportunities. The Company protects its brand through careful license and product selection and control processes.

See Item 1A — “Risk Factors — Business Related Risks — “The failure to obtain new licensees and distribution relationships or to maintain relationships with its existing licensees and distributors could materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues, earnings and business.”
 Design and Manufacturing 
 The Company’s products are manufactured by original equipment manufacturers in accordance with the Company’s specifications. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, 100% of the Company’s purchases consisted of finished goods from foreign manufacturers located in People’s Republic of China. 
 The Company’s design team is responsible for product development and works closely with suppliers and determines the cosmetic and other features for new products. Accordingly, the exterior designs and operating features of the products reflect the Company’s judgment, or that of its customers, of current styles and consumer preferences. 
 The following summarizes the Company’s purchases from its major suppliers that provided more than 10% of the Company’s total purchases in fiscal 2019 and 2018: 
 
 
 | Fiscal Year | 
-----------------------------------------+-------------+---
Supplier | 2019 | | | 2018
Itoma | | 71 | % | | 34 | %
Midea | | 19 | % | | 59 | %
Total | | 90 | % | | 93 | %
* All other suppliers were less than 10% | | | | | | 

 
The Company considers its relationships with its suppliers to be satisfactory and believes that, barring any unusual material or part shortages or economic, fiscal or monetary conditions, the Company could develop alternative suppliers. No assurance can be given that ample supply of product would be available at current prices and on current credit terms if the Company were required to seek alternative sources of supply without adequate notice by a supplier or a reasonable opportunity to seek alternate production facilities and component parts (See Item 1A — “Risk Factors — Business Related Risks — The Company depends on a limited number of suppliers for its products. If its relationships with such suppliers terminate or are otherwise impaired, the Company would likely experience increased costs, disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of its products and a material loss of net sales.” and Item 7 — “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.) 
 Warranties 
 The Company offers limited warranties for its consumer electronics, comparable to those offered to consumers by the Company’s competitors in the United States. Such warranties typically consist of a one year period for microwaves and a 90 day period for audio products, under which the Company pays for labor and parts, or offers a new or similar unit in exchange for a non-performing unit. 
Returned Products 
 The Company’s customers return product for a variety of reasons, including: 
  
• | retailer return policies which allow customer returns for no reason concerning the quality of the product itself;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | damage to goods in transit and cosmetic imperfections; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | mechanical failures.
--+---------------------

Backlog 
 The Company does not believe that backlog is a significant factor. The ability of management to correctly anticipate and provide for inventory requirements is essential to the successful operation of the Company’s business.

Trademarks 
 The Company owns the following principal trademarks for certain consumer electronic products in the United States, Canada, Mexico and various other countries: 
  
• | Emerson®
--+---------


• | Emerson Research®
--+------------------


• | H.H. Scott®
--+------------


• | iDEA®
--+------


• | IDIVA®
--+-------


• | Ölevia®
--+--------


• | Scott®
--+-------


• | SmartSet®
--+----------

 The Company’s trademark registrations must be renewed at various times. The Company intends to renew all trademarks necessary for the conduct of its business. The Company considers the Emerson® trademark to be of material importance to its business and, to a lesser degree, the remaining trademarks. The Company licenses the Emerson® and certain of its other trademarks to third parties, the scope of which is on a limited product and geographic basis and for a period of time. See “Licensing Activities.” 
 Competition 
 The Company primarily competes in the low-to-medium-priced sector of the housewares and consumer electronics market. Management estimates that the Company has several dozen competitors that are manufacturers and/or distributors, many of which are much larger and have greater financial resources than the Company. The Company competes primarily on the basis of: 

• | brand recognition;
--+-------------------


• | reliability;
--+-------------


• | quality;
--+---------


• | price;
--+-------


• | design;
--+--------


• | consumer acceptance of the Company’s products; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | the quality of service and support provided to retailers and their customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Company also competes at the retail level for shelf space and promotional displays, all of which have an impact on its success in established and proposed distribution channels. 
 Government Regulation 
 Pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, the Trade Act of 1974 and regulations promulgated there under, the United States government charges tariff duties, excess charges, assessments and penalties on many imports. These regulations are subject to continuous change and revision by government agencies and by action of the United States Trade Representative. As all of the Company’s products are currently manufactured by suppliers in China, the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international trade regulations or executive action affecting trade agreements, changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements or changes in sourcing patterns could adversely affect the Company’s operations. See Item 1A — “Risk Factors — Business Related Risks — Foreign regulations and changes in trade policies and the political, social and economic conditions in the United States and the foreign countries in which the Company operates its business could affect the Company’s revenues and earnings materially and adversely.” A number of states have adopted statutes regulating the manner of determining the amount of payments to independent service centers performing warranty service on products such as those sold by the Company. Additional Federal legislation and regulations regarding the importation of consumer electronics products, including the products marketed by the Company, have been proposed from time to time and, if enacted into law, could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

Product Liability and Insurance 
 Because of the nature of the products it sells, the Company is periodically subject to product liability claims resulting from personal injuries. The Company may also become involved in various lawsuits incidental to its business. 
 Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that the Company’s coverage limits will be sufficient to cover any successful product liability claims made against it in the future. In management’s opinion, any ultimate liability arising out of currently pending product liability claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. However, any claims substantially in excess of the Company’s insurance coverage, or any substantial claim not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. 
 Employees 
 As of June 6, 2019, the Company had 23 employees, comprised of 11 in the United States and 12 in China. None of the Company’s employees are represented by unions, and the Company believes its labor relations are good.
