ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Alarm.com is the leading platform for the intelligently connected property. We offer a comprehensive suite of cloud-based solutions for smart residential and commercial properties, including interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation, energy management and wellness solutions. Millions of property owners depend on our technology to intelligently secure, monitor and manage their residential and commercial properties. In the last year alone, our platforms processed more than 200 billion data points generated by over 90 million connected devices. We believe that this scale of subscribers, connected devices and data operations makes us the leader in the connected property market.
Our solutions are delivered through an established network of over 8,000 trusted service providers, who are experts at selling, installing and supporting our solutions. We primarily generate Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, and license revenue through our service provider partners, who resell these services and pay us monthly fees. We also generate hardware and other revenue, primarily from our service provider partners and distributors. Our hardware sales include connected devices that enable our services, such as video cameras, gateway modules and smart thermostats. 
We enter into contracts with our service provider partners that establish pricing for access to our platform solutions and for the sale of hardware. These contracts typically have an initial term of one year, with subsequent renewal terms of one year. Our service provider partners typically enter into contracts with our subscribers, which our service provider partners have indicated range from three to five years in length. Our service provider partners are free to market and sell our products under their own guidelines at prices to the consumer that they establish independently. We believe that the length of the service relationship with residential and commercial property owners, combined with our robust SaaS platforms and over 15 years of operating experience, contribute to a compelling business model.
We have experienced significant growth since our company's inception in 2000. We generated total revenue of $420.5 million, $338.9 million and $261.1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our SaaS and license revenue was $291.1 million, $236.3 million and $173.5 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing a compound annual growth rate of 29.5%. We also generated net income of $21.5 million, $29.3 million and $10.2 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as well as Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, of $93.1 million, $71.6 million and $49.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See footnote 4 to the table contained in the section of this Annual Report titled "Selected Financial Data" for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.
Our Solutions and Integrated Platforms
Our technology platforms are designed to make connected properties safer, smarter and more efficient. Our solutions are used in both smart residential and commercial properties, which we refer to as the connected property market and we have designed our technology platforms for all market participants. This includes not only the residential and commercial property owners who subscribe to our services, but also the hardware partners who manufacture devices that integrate with our platforms and the service provider partners who install and maintain our solutions.
Our service provider partners can deploy our interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation and energy management solutions as stand-alone offerings or as combined solutions to address the needs of a broad range of customers. Our technology enables subscribers to seamlessly connect to their property through our family of mobile apps, websites, and new engagement platforms like voice control through Amazon Echo and Google Home, wearable devices like the Apple Watch, and TV platforms such as Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV.
Subscriber Solutions
Interactive Security 
Interactive security is the entry point for most of our smart home and business subscribers. Our dedicated, two-way cellular connection between the property and our platforms is designed to be tamper resistant and to meet the high reliability standards for life safety services. Our solution integrates monitoring 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with emergency response through trusted and integrated central monitoring stations. Subscribers can use our services to control and monitor their security systems, as well as connected security devices including motion sensors, door locks, garage doors, thermostats and video cameras. The capabilities associated with this solution include:
 3


◦ | Alarm Transmission. We transmit alarm signals from monitored properties through our platforms to over 1,000 third-party central monitoring stations staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week with live operators ready to initiate emergency response.


◦ | Always-On Monitoring. Whether the security system is armed or disarmed, sensors continuously monitor activity at the property so subscribers can be made aware of system events in all kinds of situations.


◦ | Insights Engine. Our proprietary machine learning algorithms help safeguard connected properties by learning the unique activity patterns at the property and automatically notifying the subscriber of unexpected activity. Facial recognition technology enhances unexpected activity alerts by enabling certain security panels with built-in cameras to proactively monitor for unauthorized sharing or theft of an authorized user's security system codes. By analyzing pictures taken when the security panel is disarmed, the system can associate a specific person with a specific user code. If a different person uses that same code, Alarm.com can send an alert to the home or business owner, providing an added layer of security, awareness and control.


◦ | Real-Time Alerts. Notifications for any type of system event are delivered through push notifications, short message service, or SMS, or email, based on the subscriber's preference.


◦ | Managed Access and Enterprise Control. Subscribers can manage their property through permission-based access, including individualized user codes and rules based on time and day. Property managers and business owners can utilize our Enterprise Control service to remotely manage employees’ access to the security system, door locks and property partitions across multiple locations.


◦ | Wellness. Our technology can learn daily living patterns of an aging family member through monitoring of activity data from security and specialized sensors and identify anomalies in real-time that may indicate a problem. Alerts can be sent to notify family members or caregivers when there are critical changes in patterns or an emergency is detected.

Video Monitoring
Our high definition video monitoring solution can provide a direct view into the property, capture footage of critical events and provide visual peace of mind. We offer indoor and outdoor camera solutions for residential and commercial properties at varying price points. We also provide a doorbell video camera solution that supports two-way audio with guests at the door.
The capabilities associated with our video monitoring solution include:

◦ | Video Analytics: Our video analytics engine provides an intelligent new layer of security and awareness for residential and commercial property owners. Object classification and object tracking technology can distinguish between people, vehicles and animals, determine an object's direction of movement and measure the duration of activity. Our subscribers can selectively control and manage notifications and assign virtual zones and multi-directional "tripwires" so they can monitor their properties for highly specific activity.


◦ | Live Streaming. Subscribers can securely access live video feeds through the web and mobile apps at any time.


◦ | Smart Clip Capture. Our video solutions can automatically record clips based on motion detection or system events, like an alarm, a door opening or someone disarming the security panel.


◦ | Secure Cloud Storage. Video clips are uploaded to our cloud-based storage system for secure storage and remote viewing.


◦ | Video Alerts. Smart clips can be automatically sent via SMS, push notifications or email as soon as they are recorded.


◦ | Continuous High Definition Recording. Onsite recording up to 24 hours a day, seven days a week is enabled through our Stream Video Recorder, or SVR, and can be played back securely, from anywhere, through the web and mobile apps.


◦ | Commercial Video Surveillance. Tailored for small and medium sized businesses, our commercial video surveillance offering provides leading commercial-grade network cameras to support a wide range of business needs, enabling multi-camera installations with continuous recording, cloud based storage and mobile access.

Intelligent Automation and Energy Management
Our solution provides enhanced monitoring and control for a large ecosystem of connected devices, including thermostats, lights, locks, power meters, shades and other devices. Increasing awareness of energy usage and providing intelligent control

over connected devices enables subscribers to create personalized automation rules and schedules. We believe our solutions can reduce energy waste as well as increase comfort and convenience for our subscribers. The capabilities associated with this solution include:

◦ | Scenes. A customizable scenes button within the Alarm.com app provides the ability to adjust multiple devices in the property with a single command. For example, a homeowner leaving the house can arm the security system, lock the front door, close the garage door and adjust the thermostat with a single command.


◦ | Smart Thermostat Schedules. Machine learning algorithms analyze system activity patterns to recommend thermostat schedules that increase energy efficiency when the property is not likely to be occupied.


◦ | Responsive Savings. Smart thermostats connected to our platforms can automatically respond to sensors and other devices in the property to conserve energy. For example, when the security system is armed away, an arming state used when the property is not occupied, the thermostat can automatically adjust to save energy.


◦ | Precision Comfort. Remote temperature sensors enable a subscriber to manage comfort in a specific area within their property. For example, a homeowner can set a desired temperature for a child's nursery to improve the child’s comfort. Subscribers can easily customize detailed schedules and rules to have the right temperature in the right location at the right time.


◦ | Energy Usage Monitoring. Real-time and historical energy usage data for the entire property and individual devices can give subscribers greater insight into the property’s energy consumption profile, which could encourage more efficient use of energy-consuming devices.


◦ | Environmental Monitoring. Subscribers can utilize environmental sensors with our platforms to monitor and control their property. For example, a leak detected by a basement water sensor can automatically shut off a water line, or a property owner can be alerted to a sump-pump failure and react accordingly.


◦ | Geo-Services. Geo-Services use a phone’s geo-location to determine when to notify a subscriber of specific system conditions, or to automatically adjust system settings. Subscribers who have enabled Geo-Services can be notified if they leave home and forgot to lock a door, close the garage door, arm their security system or close a window. Additionally, smart thermostats and lights can be automatically adjusted based on the subscriber's location. Subscribers can create multiple geo-fences and customize the opt-in feature to meet their specific needs.


◦ | Demand Response Programs. Utilities can reduce or shift power consumption during peak demand periods by accessing connected thermostats and other connected appliances that participate in the utility's program. Managed at scale, these voluntary programs can significantly reduce costs for utilities. In addition to enabling subscribers to participate in these programs through our energy management solution, our EnergyHub subsidiary aggregates a diverse set of smart thermostats, enabling utilities to leverage these devices to operate demand response programs and improve the results of certain demand response events through our SaaS platforms.

Commercial Solutions
In addition to our residential solutions, we offer Alarm.com for Business, a security solution for small and medium businesses, ranging from single-site to multi-location enterprises. Alarm.com for Business combines intelligent intrusion detection, video surveillance, access control and energy management into a single solution through Alarm.com's app and online interfaces. Our Smarter Access Control solution, part of the unified Alarm.com for Business platform, helps solve many of the challenges faced by small business owners, with an array of always-on operational tools that can improve management and control. Our solution enhances and simplifies business operations, streamlines security, saves energy and provides insights into customer habits. Additionally, our business insights tools provide actionable intelligence, including open and close trends by location, peak periods of activity and customer traffic and energy savings opportunities. Key benefits of the commercial offering include:

◦ | Daily Safeguards. Smarter business security keeps subscribers' properties and business locations secure with automatic arming at a certain time each day or after a certain period of inactivity.


◦ | Commercial Grade Video Solutions. Connected commercial cameras communicate with the security system, capturing clips as activity occurs, and clips are uploaded to our cloud-based storage system for secure storage and remote viewing. Subscribers can receive real-time alerts and instantly view footage through the web or mobile apps if the alarm goes off, a door is unlocked, or unexpected activity occurs outside of normal business hours. Business owners can assess the situation and take appropriate action at any time of day and from any location.

◦ | Energy Savings. Our smarter thermostat helps subscribers reduce energy costs automatically, even if someone forgets to adjust the temperature when they're closing up at the end of the day, generating a return on investment.


◦ | Protection for Valuables and Inventory. Quick notifications keep business owners in the know about individuals entering or exiting the back office, the supply room, or any other specific rooms or doors.


◦ | Access Control. Business owners and managers can easily add and delete access for new employees and departing employees in a few clicks, without calling the alarm company or worrying about spare keys.


◦ | Operational Insights. Visibility into activity patterns and trends can help business owners make smarter decisions around staffing, promotions, energy use and more. Reports show activity patterns across the business, helping owners spot new opportunities for staffing, traffic flow and promotions.


◦ | Early Problem Identification. Early identification of activity such as unexpected entry after hours, or doors propped open that could cause energy waste or safety concerns, helps business owners quickly respond to problematic situations. Alarm.com provides a time stamped log of which users armed or disarmed the system or entered the property using their keycard.


◦ | Simple to Use. Alarm.com’s smartphone app is intuitive to use, with visibility and control of every solution available within a single dashboard.

Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platforms and applications, support our technology infrastructure, develop new capabilities and conduct quality assurance testing. We expect to invest significantly in continued research and development efforts to expand the capabilities of our technology. Our research and development of new products and services is a multidisciplinary effort across our product management, program management, software engineering, device engineering, quality engineering, configuration management and network operations teams. As of December 31, 2018, we had 500 employees engaged in research and development functions.
Service Provider Network
Our trusted service provider partner network is key in driving the adoption of connected home and commercial solutions. Our solutions are sold, installed, and serviced by a network of independent licensed, professional service provider partners. Our channel network currently consists of over 8,000 active service provider partners, including smaller local providers, larger regional providers and national service providers with thousands of employees. We have also seen growth in other areas of our channel network, including new providers in the intelligent automation, HVAC, property management and insurance markets.
We believe this highly trusted, established network is a core strength that enables an efficient and scalable customer acquisition model, allowing us to focus on technology innovation. We also believe that the combination of our solutions and our service provider partners’ expertise is the most effective way to drive mass market adoption of the intelligently connected property.
The traditional security and home automation market is highly fragmented with approximately 15,000 security dealers nationally. According to the February 2019 Barnes Buchanan Conference Report, the top 5 dealers represented 35% of all industry recurring monthly revenue in 2018. The distribution of revenue among our service provider partners is reflective of the industry overall. Monitronics International, Inc., rebranded and now doing business as Brinks Home Security, represented greater than 10% but not more than 15% of our revenue in 2016 and 2017. ADT LLC represented greater than 15% but not more than 20% of our revenue in 2017 and 2018.
Subscribers
Our platforms currently support millions of residential and commercial subscribers. We define the number of subscribers as the number of residential or commercial properties to which we are delivering at least one of our solutions. A subscriber who subscribes to one of our service level packages as well as one or more of our a la carte add-ons is counted as one subscriber. Our number of subscribers does not include the customers of our service provider partners to whom we license our intellectual property, as they do not utilize one of our SaaS platforms. Our subscriber acquisition cost payback period has historically been less than one year.
Sales and Marketing
The goal of our sales team is to help our service provider partners succeed in selling, installing and supporting our full suite of solutions. Our sales team is also responsible for recruiting new service provider partners to Alarm.com. We also have a global business development team dedicated to establishing new service provider and distribution relationships in international markets.
Our marketing team is focused on empowering our service provider partners to effectively promote and sell our solutions. We design, develop and provide end-to-end marketing services including tools and content for lifecycle marketing to help our service providers build awareness, create interest, activate subscribers, develop and maintain the ongoing customer relationship, increase customer engagement, and generate upsell and referral opportunities. While we offer tools and services to assist our service providers when they are marketing to potential subscribers, we do not control or influence the marketing activities performed by our service providers, as they are free to select the marketing tools they believe will be the most effective. Our contracts with our service providers require that they comply with all applicable rules and laws when engaging in marketing activities. We also offer comprehensive training opportunities through our Alarm.com Academy, including in-person training courses and an online learning management system.
We believe our sales and marketing approach enables us to expand our breadth of service providers, provide highly customized services and scale quickly. As of December 31, 2018, we had 288 employees engaged in sales and marketing functions.

Service Provider Support
We support the full suite of software and hardware products on the Alarm.com platform through a highly trained and experienced team of professionals based in the United States. We primarily support our service provider partners. Our service provider partners, in turn, support their customers, who are our subscribers. To that end, subscribers occasionally reach us directly with support needs and we either assist the subscriber directly or, when appropriate, route the subscriber to the appropriate service provider partner for additional assistance.
We offer high-quality support to our service providers via phone, web ticketing and email. With every interaction, our team is committed to exceptional customer satisfaction and industry-leading response times. We use a tiered structure to efficiently escalate and resolve issues of varying complexity and to scale our support organization as we grow. Our staff is multilingual and we continue to grow our language capabilities to support our international expansion.
Our Competition
The market in which we participate for connected property solutions is fragmented, highly competitive and constantly evolving. We expect competition to continue from existing competitors as well as potential new market entrants in the interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation and energy management markets. Our current competitors include providers of other technology platforms for the connected property with interactive security, including Honeywell International Inc., Resideo Technologies Inc., Telular Corporation (acquired by AMETEK, Inc.), SecureNet Technologies, LLC, Alula (formed following the merger of ipDatatel, LLC and Resolution Products, LLC), and United Technologies Corporation, which sell solutions to service providers, cable operators, technology retailers and other residential and commercial automation providers. We also compete with interactive, monitored security solutions sold directly to subscribers by firms like Scout and SimpliSafe. In addition, our service provider partners compete with managed service providers, such as cable television, telephone and broadband companies like Comcast, AT&T Inc. and Charter Communications, Inc., and providers of point products, including Google Inc.'s Nest Labs, Inc. which offers the Nest Secure security system as well as a smart thermostat, the Nest Protect smart smoke detector and video cameras. Amazon.com offers Amazon Home Services security packages with bundled equipment and professional installation, and Amazon Key, a security camera and smart lock integration feature. Ring Inc., owned by Amazon.com, offers a connected video doorbell, video cameras and an integrated security system, Ring Alarm. Samsung's SmartThings offers a security system and a home automation and awareness hub. Arlo Technologies, Inc. offers connected video cameras, a connected video doorbell, and smart security devices. Apple Inc. offers a feature that allows some manufacturers’ connected devices and accessories to be controlled through its HomeKit service available in Apple’s iOS operating system. Additionally, Canary and other companies offer all in one video monitoring and awareness devices. In addition, we may compete with other large technology companies that offer control capabilities among their products, applications and services, and that may have ongoing development efforts to address the broader connected home market.
Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have. We expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets as well as increased competition, both domestically and internationally, from other established and emerging residential and commercial security monitoring, video monitoring and automation, wellness, and energy management companies as well as large technology companies. In addition, there may be new technologies that are introduced that reduce demand for our solutions or make them obsolete. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties and rapidly acquire significant market share, or they may acquire third-party technology or solution providers that we partner with and choose not to offer those solutions on our platforms. Increased competition could also result in price reductions and loss of market share, any of which could result in lower revenue and negatively affect our ability to grow our business. We believe the principal competitive factors in the connected property market include the following:
•simplicity and ease of use;
•ability to offer persistent awareness, control, and intelligent automation;
•breadth of features and functionality provided;
•flexibility of the solutions and ability to personalize for the individual consumer;
•compatibility with a wide selection of third-party devices;
•pricing, affordability, and accessibility;
•sales reach and local installation and support capabilities; and
•brand awareness and reputation.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. Additionally, we believe that our cloud-based software platforms, intelligently connected property solutions, and proven scalability help further differentiate us from competitors. Nevertheless, our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets and broader distribution channels than we do.
Our Intellectual Property
Our success and ability to compete effectively depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and to establish and adequately protect our intellectual property rights. To accomplish these objectives, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality agreements and other contractual protections.
As of December 31, 2018, we owned 188 issued United States utility patents, one issued United States design patent, three issued Canadian patents and one issued Australian patent that are scheduled to expire between 2021 and 2037. We continue to file patent applications and as of December 31, 2018, we had 178 pending utility patent applications and 45 provisional patent applications filed in the United States. We also had ten pending patent applications in Canada, nine pending patent applications in Europe, eight pending patent applications in Australia and 20 international patent applications pending under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. The claims for which we have sought patent protection apply to both our platforms and solutions. Our patent and patent applications generally apply to the features and functions of our platforms, and solutions and the applications associated with our platforms. We also have, and may be required to seek, licenses under patents or intellectual property rights owned by third parties, including open-source software and other commercially available software.
We also rely on several registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. We have 19 registered trademarks in the United States, including Alarm.com and the Alarm.com logo and design, and six registered trademarks in Canada.
We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by requiring our employees and independent contractors involved in development to enter into agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, concepts, processes, improvements and other works generated by them on our behalf are our intellectual property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim in those works.
We expect that products in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement lawsuits as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. We have brought infringement claims against third parties in the past and may do so in the future to defend our intellectual property position. In addition, from time to time, we may face claims by third parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights. In the future, we, or our service providers or subscribers, may be the subject of legal proceedings alleging that our solutions or underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 884 full-time employees. We also engage consultants and temporary employees from time to time. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
