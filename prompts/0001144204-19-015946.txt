Our Core Business (Digital Data Solutions (DDS) Segment)
 
We specialize in combining deep neural networks and human expertise in multiple domains (including health, science, and law) to make “unstructured information” (sometimes referred to as “content”) useable. For business information companies, “useable” means that the content can be sold via subscription to a digital product. For enterprises, “useable” means that the content can drive digital process transformation and AI. We work with all classes of data, including sensitive and protected data.
 
We also develop digital products for business information companies and digital systems which replace legacy systems and processes.
 
In 2018, we continued to implement a strategy we initiated in 2017 focused on technology differentiation, increasingly taking an innovation-led approach to create value for clients while driving leaner, more cost-effective operations.
 
Our Approach: Deep Neural Networks and Experts-in-the-loop
 
Finding the right approach for mixing machines and experts-in-the-loop for each customer requirement is one of our core competencies. On the human side, we have over three thousand staff with deep domain expertise in legal, tax, regulatory, scientific, technical, and health-related content. Many hold advanced degrees. They work from our global operations centers in North and South America, Europe, Israel, India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. Our operations centers in Asia are ISO 27001 certified. On the technology side, we use deep learning, a sophisticated machine learning technique which is a branch of artificial intelligence that has enjoyed great success in real-world applications.
 
In our approach, content is fed first into our deep learning machines that automate much of the work, but distinguish between what they can automatically process and what requires human intervention. Work that requires humans is “pushed” to human experts. Once human experts perform tasks, their output is then fed back to the machines, which, as a result, become “smarter” and achieve over time progressively greater levels of automation. (See “Our Technology and Infrastructure”, below.)
 
Our Customers
 
Our customers include leading digital businesses in banking and financial services, technology, and digital retailing and four of the largest information industry companies in the world, spanning financial, legal, healthcare and scientific vertical markets.1 Our customers often seek to use digital data in combination with AI to support their businesses or to digitally transform operations.

Our Services
 

(i) | Data Acquisition, Transformation, and Enrichment at Scale
----+----------------------------------------------------------

 
In order to use content in an information product or in AI, there are often significant obstacles that must be overcome: the content may be contained in multiple websites; it may be in disparate formats; and it may lack the necessary semantics and metadata to make it product- or AI-ready. Innodata overcomes these obstacles by combining advanced technology and human subject matter experts, enabling us to produce highly refined product- and AI-ready content efficiently and at scale.
 
Acquiring unstructured data often involves monitoring thousands of sources such as websites in real-time for new or changing content and then automatically extracting the changed content. One of the challenges with web data monitoring and extraction is that the HTML code underlying web pages often changes, causing programs and scripts to break. We overcome this by using enterprise-class tools for content change detection and extraction. These tools use both machine learning-based visual data abstraction combined with traditional programmatic approaches. With visual abstraction, the technology knows what the content “looks like” and recognizes when a data element moves from one spot on a Web page to another.
 
Digital data transformation can refer to a large number of very specific tasks necessary to create well-structured, valid XML, such as text zoning, editing, format tagging, format conversion, extraction, cross-reference capture, and linking.
 
Digital data enrichment often includes structural tagging as well as semantic enrichment such as entity tagging and normalization. Data enrichment also includes text categorization - classifying content to systems that organize knowledge such as ontologies and knowledge graphs. This kind of enrichment enables powerful information retrieval and discovery and provides hooks for integration and interoperability.
 

(ii) | Digital Operations Management and Analytics
-----+--------------------------------------------

 
We provide digital operations management and analytics for an increasing diversity of complex functions. At present, these include IP rights management, contract management, customer relations, data processing, regulatory reporting, publishing workflow management, publisher relationship management, and transaction management. Our services draw on a combination of industry and functional expertise from our thousands of global delivery resources, many with advanced degrees, augmented by sophisticated machine learning and robotics process automation (RPA) technology.
 
Our digital operations management solutions often leverage our core competency in augmenting human expert effort with advanced technology and configuring the technology to continually improve as a result of expert feedback. In this way, we provide high-quality, cost-effective solutions for our customers that become increasingly automated, resulting in further cost and improvements in both productivity and response time.
 
Many of the operations we manage are mission-critical for our customers (as opposed to back-office), are unique, and have multiple contingencies and potential points of failure. To manage this complexity, we have developed methodologies and best practices around process management and risk mitigation, and we work with clients at a strategic business and technology level.
 
Examples of recent deployments:
 

· | Digitally transforming and managing a complex operation for rights and royalty management for a leading provider of print and interactive online properties.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Technology and Infrastructure
 
Our deep learning technologies are built on frameworks such as TensorFlow and Torch that layer algorithms to create artificial neural networks that continuously learn on the job, constantly improving the quality and accuracy of results.
 
Our content processing application infrastructure consists of three integrated tiers. The first tier is an orchestration layer featuring a console we use to configure our workflow engines. Each workflow is customized around the content acquisition, transformation, and enrichment tasks required to transform a specific input into a specific output. This is where we oversee and manage AI, setting our accuracy thresholds and quality assurance parameters to decide when cognitive tasks that have been performed by machines are sent for human review.
 
The second tier of our data processing application infrastructure is a microservices layer of deep learning networks which perform discrete tasks automatically. Microservices are invoked by workflows via RESTful APIs. Our deep neural networks are trained to understand domain-specific terms and meaning and can be deployed to enforce privacy and maintain customer-proprietary learning. We have built domain-specific and task-specific microservices that perform deep sequence labelling, text categorization, and computer vision. The technology works by observing text patterns using algorithms and assigning labels based on these observed values.
 
For each cognitive decision, the machines provide a result together with a confidence score. A high confidence score means the machine is confident that it has performed accurately and the content is ready to be deployed in an information product or for AI. A low confidence score means expert review is required.
 
Our third layer is human experts-in-the-loop. When an expert review is required, the human experts use tools we refer to as “workbenches” to apply their expertise to a task. The workbenches are integrated with the microservice endpoints in one of two ways. In one deployment, only low-confidence data is sent to workbenches for human review. In an alternative deployment, we send both high-confidence and low-confidence data back to the workbench, displaying the confidence level for each decision taken by the machine. In both of these deployments, human-reviewed work is retroactively fed back into the deep neural network, enabling it to get smarter. The result is continuous, predicable improvement and progressively greater levels of automation.

Clients 
 
Two clients in our DDS segment each generated more than 10% of our total revenues in the 2018 and 2017 fiscal years. In 2018, revenues from Wolters Kluwer affiliated companies (the “WK Clients”) were approximately $10.6 million or 19% of total revenues, and revenues from Reed Elsevier affiliated companies (the “RE Clients”) were approximately $6.4 million, or 11% of total revenues. No other client generated more than 10% of our total revenues in 2018. These two clients together generated approximately 30% of our total revenues in each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 
We have long-standing relationships with many of our clients, and we have provided services to the two clients mentioned in the preceding paragraph for over ten years. Our track record of delivering high-quality services helps us to solidify client relationships. Many of our clients are recurring clients, meaning that they have continued to provide additional projects to us after our initial engagement with them.
 
Our contractual arrangements with the RE Clients during 2018 consisted of three master services agreements (“MSAs”) and separately agreed to statements of work (“SOWs”) for specific services. Two of the MSAs have indefinite terms and the third MSA has a term that ends on October 31, 2019. RE Clients may terminate the MSAs on notice periods ranging from zero to six months, and they may terminate certain individual SOWs on notice periods of up to 90 days. They may also terminate certain of the MSAs and SOWs on notice periods of three months or less for “cause” and for insolvency related events, and on changes of control, force majeure and the imposition of certain price increases by the Company that are not acceptable to them. We may terminate two of the MSAs on notice periods of 180 days, and we may also terminate certain MSAs and SOWs for “cause”, insolvency related events affecting the RE Clients, and other defined events. The MSAs contain confidentiality, limitation of liability, indemnification and other standard provisions.
 
Our contractual arrangements with the WK Clients during calendar year 2018 consisted of four MSAs and separately agreed to SOWs for specific services. Two MSAs have indefinite terms, one MSA continues in effect until the completion of all services performed under the MSA, and the fourth MSA has a term that ends on the later of March 2, 2020 or the expiration date of all SOWs issued under the MSA. WK Clients may terminate certain MSAs on notice periods of 30 days, and they may terminate certain individual SOWs on notice periods ranging from 10 days to six months. WK Clients may also terminate certain of the MSAs and SOWs on notice periods of 60 days or less for “cause” and for insolvency related events, and on changes of control, force majeure and the imposition of certain price increases by the Company that are not acceptable to them. We may terminate certain of the MSAs on notice periods of 30 days, and we may also terminate certain MSAs and SOWs for “cause”, insolvency related events affecting the WK Clients, and other defined events.
