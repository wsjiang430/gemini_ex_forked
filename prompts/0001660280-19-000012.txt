Item 1.        Business
Overview
We are the first and only provider of solutions for a new category of cybersecurity that we call Cyber Exposure. Cyber Exposure is a discipline for managing and measuring cybersecurity risk in the digital era. We are building on our deep technology expertise in the traditional vulnerability assessment and management market and expanding that market to include modern attack surfaces and provide analytics that translate vulnerability data into business insight.
Digital transformation is driving radical change. As organizations modernize their IT infrastructure and adopt cloud or hybrid cloud architectures that are no longer housed in the confines of their corporate networks, they have less visibility and control over the security of these assets. Organizations are also increasingly implementing modern solutions, such as Internet of Things, or IoT, devices and application containers, to enable the rapid development and deployment of new products, services and business models, as well as to drive operational efficiencies. Further, safety-critical Operational Technology, or OT, such as Industrial Control Systems, are now network-connected and need to be secured from cybersecurity threats. This digital transformation increases IT complexity and cybersecurity risk as attack surfaces expand. We refer to an organization’s inability to see the breadth of the modern attack surface and analyze the level of cyber exposure as the Cyber Exposure Gap.
While other functions in an organization, such as finance and operations, have a system to help them manage and measure risk, to date, cybersecurity risk has not been adequately measured and understood. Our platform is built to be the Cyber Exposure Command Center for an organization’s Chief Information Security Officer, or CISO. Our platform provides the CISO with unified visibility into the organization’s state of security and enables security teams to prioritize and focus their remediation efforts. Our platform also translates vulnerability data into actionable business metrics and insights that boards of directors and executives can understand and use to make strategic decisions. We believe our Cyber Exposure solutions are transforming how security is managed and measured and will help organizations more rapidly embrace digital transformation.
Our platform offerings provide broad visibility into security issues such as vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, internal and regulatory compliance violations and other indicators of the state of an organization’s security. We also provide deep analytics to help organizations measure trends in their cyber exposure over time. Our platform integrates and analyzes data from our native collectors alongside IT asset, vulnerability and threat data from third-party systems and applications to prioritize security issues for remediation and focus an organization’s resources based on risk and business criticality. 
We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. In 2018, 2017 and 2016 our total revenue was $267.4 million, $187.7 million and $124.4 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth rates of 42% from 2017 to 2018 and 51% from 2016 to 2017. Our net loss was $73.5 million, $41.0 million and $37.2 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Our Platform Offerings
Our vision is to empower every organization to understand and reduce their cybersecurity risk. We are the first and only platform designed to provide broad visibility and deep insights into cyber exposure across the entire modern attack surface, as a result of which we believe our platform can become the system of record for cybersecurity.
Our Enterprise Platform Offerings
Our enterprise platform is built to serve as the Cyber Exposure Command Center, enabling organizations to answer foundational and strategic questions such as:

• | Where are we exposed?


• | Where should we prioritize based on risk?


• | Are we reducing our exposure over time?


• | How do we compare to our peers?

Our enterprise platform offerings, including Tenable.io, Tenable.sc, previously referred to as SecurityCenter, and Industrial Security, are built to provide organizations with the breadth of visibility to accurately understand both traditional and modern attack surfaces and the depth of insight that stems from risk-based analytics, prioritization and benchmarking. Our Cyber Exposure platform automatically discovers assets, including those in cloud environments, and assesses these assets for the presence of vulnerabilities, internal and regulatory compliance violations, misconfigurations and other cybersecurity issues, analyzes and prioritizes cybersecurity risks based on the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the business criticality of the asset, and provides an objective way to measure an organization’s cyber exposure.
We offer two solutions for vulnerability management which provide flexible deployment options based on a customer’s maturity in moving to the cloud. Tenable.io is our software as a service, or SaaS, offering for vulnerability 
management, and Tenable.sc is our on-premises vulnerability management offering, both of which enable organizations to quickly and accurately identify, investigate and prioritize vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across a range of traditional IT assets, such as networking infrastructure, desktops and on-premises servers, and modern IT assets, such as cloud workloads, containers, web applications, IoT and OT assets. Enterprises typically start with vulnerability management to secure traditional IT assets and expand their deployment over time to cover more traditional IT assets and/or more types of modern assets by deploying additional applications. For organizations with hybrid IT environments, some customers choose to expand their deployments to include both Tenable.sc and Tenable.io as an integrated solution spanning both on-premise and cloud-based management.
Launched in 2017 in partnership with Siemens, Industrial Security, an OT-specific offering, is an asset discovery and vulnerability assessment solution, built on our patented passive network monitoring technology. Industrial Security monitors critical infrastructure in energy, utilities and other sectors, utilizing a non-intrusive approach to give security and plant operations teams the ability to discover, visualize and monitor their most sensitive systems. Industrial Security includes comprehensive asset discovery, passive vulnerability detection and multi-site management, which allows for a consolidated view across multiple locations. We currently offer Industrial Security as a stand-alone solution, and we intend to integrate it within the Tenable.io offering.
Our enterprise platform offerings deliver the following capabilities:

• | Live asset discovery. We can automatically discover a broad range of traditional and modern IT assets, including on-premises infrastructure, applications, cloud environments, mobile devices, containers, IoT devices and OT systems. We use a combination of active scanning, passive network monitoring and public cloud monitoring via our connector to identify known and unknown assets on the network.


• | Automated exposure assessment. With every change in a customer’s computing environment, we can automatically assess and identify where there are vulnerabilities, internal and regulatory compliance violations and misconfigurations across assets and cloud environments, such as missing software patches or outdated software versions. In addition, we can help optimize existing security technology investments to identify indicators of cyber exposure, such as improperly configured anti-virus software.


• | Deep analytics to allow for prioritization. We combine our product and research IP with third-party data to provide business context and allow organizations to prioritize remediation efforts based on the business criticality of the asset and the severity of the issue. Additionally, we recently announced the release of Predictive Prioritization, which enables organizations to reduce business risk by focusing on the vulnerabilities with the greatest likelihood of imminently being exploited. Predictive Prioritization combines Tenable vulnerability data with third party threat and vulnerability data across 150 data sources using a proprietary machine learning algorithm developed by the Tenable Research data science team to predict the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. Predictive Prioritization provides a threat-based view of vulnerabilities, which is a critical component of modern vulnerability management, and will be included within both Tenable.io and Tenable.sc.


• | Open and extensible platform. Our platform ingests a wide set of third-party data sources to enhance analysis and integrates that data with industry-leading IT workflow, security information and event management, or SIEM, and systems management tools to accelerate remediation and provide common visibility across security and IT operations teams.


• | Cyber exposure measurement. Our expansive knowledge base of assets and vulnerabilities coupled with data science insights help our customers objectively score, trend and benchmark cyber exposure across their organizations, including by business unit or geography, and compare their cyber exposure against industry peers and best practices. We believe this capability is critical to help the CISO effectively translate technical information and communicate cybersecurity risk to a non-technical audience, including the C-suite and the Board of Directors, to make better strategic decisions on where to focus investment to maximize cybersecurity risk reduction. Our vision is to create industry standard metrics and benchmarks for Cyber Exposure to create an objective measure of cyber risk. In support of this vision, we plan to release Tenable Lumin to help organizations with cyber exposure measurement, which will include scoring, trending and benchmarking capabilities and data science insights.

Nessus
Our co-founder is the creator of Nessus, one of the most widely deployed vulnerability assessment solutions in the cybersecurity industry, which underpins our enterprise platform. Since the introduction of Nessus in 1998, an extensive 
community of Nessus users has emerged. We continue to cultivate knowledge and affinity within this user base, which, when combined with our enterprise customers and our Tenable Research team of cybersecurity and data science experts, creates powerful network effects in the form of a continuous feedback loop of data and insights. We use these learnings to expand our assessment capabilities and coverage, continually optimize our solutions and inform our product strategy and innovation priorities. We believe these data and insights will also fuel and strengthen our benchmarking capabilities over time.
Nessus Professional
Nessus Professional is a vulnerability assessment solution for identifying security vulnerabilities, configuration issues and malware. Nessus Professional serves as both a stand-alone product designed for security consultants and practitioners performing one-time or ad-hoc assessment as well as an on-ramp product to our enterprise platform. With broad vulnerability coverage, accurate analysis and an easy-to-use interface, Nessus Professional offers a cost-effective and comprehensive solution for security consultants and users with ad-hoc assessment needs.
Nessus Home
We also offer a free version of our Nessus product, Nessus Home, which includes vulnerability and configuration assessment for a limited number of assets, but does not include access to support and certain features that Nessus Professional customers enjoy.
Technology Architecture
Our platform is built from the ground up to support the needs of modern IT assets and cloud environments. Our platform’s scalability can meet the requirements of the largest global enterprise customers, which may require assessment for millions of assets. In addition, we offer a published service level agreement promising 99.95% availability to help ensure the reliability of operation for our customers.
Foundational elements of our technology architecture include:

• | Microservices-based architecture. DevOps are software development practices and tools that increase an organization’s ability to rapidly deliver applications and services. In a DevOps model, building security into the application development process is difficult. Technologies like microservices, which structure an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, and application containers, which are lightweight, portable pieces of software used to package applications and services, have emerged to support DevOps processes. Our architecture consists of microservices running in containers provided by Docker Inc. and orchestrated by the open-source system Kubernetes. Containers allow us to utilize a DevOps philosophy in our software development lifecycle, which permits us to perform numerous code updates per day. The result is faster and more predictable time to market for new capabilities and services.


• | Public cloud infrastructure for agility. Our use of the public cloud delivers agility and market responsiveness without the capital investment or time delay involved with planning, purchasing and deploying hardware. It also provides a flexible cost profile in which capacity can be quickly adjusted up or down in response to new opportunities and market demand, with relatively modest fixed costs.


• | Scalability. Our platform scales up and down to continuously meet customer demands, through the use of public cloud infrastructure around the world. This approach provides elastic resources for compute, data transfer and storage, and allows us to meet the needs of even the largest global enterprises and government agencies. Our platform manages and supports millions of assets for multiple enterprise customers across a variety of industries, with the ability to process millions of application programming interface, or API, calls daily. The platform can scale to support IoT deployments that are an order of magnitude larger than IT deployments.


• | Availability. Our modern architecture, leveraging state-of-the-art public cloud services, offers high availability and high performance. It provides geographic redundancy, as well as automated backup, without the need for us to build redundant infrastructure. As a result, we offer a service level agreement for Tenable.io that promises 99.95% availability.


• | Portability. Tenable.io primarily resides in a public cloud environment and offers the flexibility to be deployed as traditional software in on-premises environments, partner environments and hybrid deployments.


• | Extensibility and integration. Our open API and software development kit, or SDK, enable import of data from third-party sources and sensors-including competitor products-to augment our native discovery,

assessment and analytics. This is essential to providing a unified view of assets, vulnerabilities and exposure across the enterprise. These capabilities also enable flexible export of our data to third party systems.

• | Widely adopted industry standard file format. The “.Nessus” file format for vulnerability data used in all of our products is openly documented and supported by dozens of products and programming languages, which simplifies integration with our ecosystem partners’ technologies.

Our Technology Ecosystem
We have partnered and/or integrated with leading technology companies to pioneer the industry’s first Cyber Exposure ecosystem to help organizations build resilient cybersecurity programs. Our ecosystem consists of a variety of third-party data import sources into our platform offerings, as well as export of our data out to third-party IT systems. Our technology ecosystem connects disparate solutions and data to automate processes and accelerate an organization’s ability to understand, manage and reduce its cyber exposure.
We integrate a variety of third-party data sources into our platform to augment our native data collection and help with analysis and prioritization. Furthermore, our data is also exported out to enrich third-party IT management and security systems. 
Our Growth Strategy
Our objectives are to maintain our market leadership in Cyber Exposure and to capture our large market opportunity. To accomplish these objectives, we intend to:

• | Continue to Acquire New Enterprise Platform Customers. We believe there is a substantial opportunity to increase adoption of our enterprise platform offerings. We have experienced strong growth in new platform customers due to investments in sales and marketing. We intend to continue to aggressively pursue new customers by adding sales capacity and leveraging our network of channel partners.

This data fuels the benchmarking offering in our platform and we believe will become a trusted source throughout the industry for understanding Cyber Exposure. Tenable Research, including data science, is a key component of our thought leadership.
We believe ongoing and timely development of new products and features is imperative to maintaining our competitive position. We continue to invest in development of our solutions across our global innovation centers in Columbia, Maryland; Los Angeles, California; San Jose, California and Dublin, Ireland.
Our research and development expense was $76.7 million, $57.7 million and $40.1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Backlog
We define backlog as contractually committed orders to be invoiced under our existing agreements that are not included in the deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had backlog of $3.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively. We expect substantially all of the backlog at December 31, 2018 to be invoiced within the following twelve months.
Competition
The market for cybersecurity solutions is fragmented, intensely competitive and constantly evolving. We compete with a range of established and emerging cybersecurity software and services vendors, as well as homegrown solutions. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to remain intense going forward. Our competitors include: vulnerability management and assessment vendors, including Qualys and Rapid7; diversified security software and services vendors, including IBM; endpoint security vendors with nascent vulnerability assessment capabilities, including Tanium and CrowdStrike; and providers of point solutions that compete with some of the features present in our solutions. We also compete against internally-developed efforts that 
often use open source solutions.
We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for cybersecurity solutions include product functionality, breadth and depth of offerings, flexibility of delivery models, ease of deployment and use, integration capabilities such as open APIs and scalability, uptime and performance. We believe that our suite of solutions generally competes favorably with respect to these factors and may serve as a complement to the solutions offered by our competitors in some cases. Some of our more established actual and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do. In addition, as our market grows and rapidly changes, we expect it will continue to attract new competitors, including larger established companies and smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new products and services.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 14 issued patents and five patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued patents expire between 2027 and 2034 and cover our passive network scanning, monitoring and analysis technologies and additional features of our enterprise platform. As of December 31, 2018, we had 16 registered trademarks and one trademark application pending in the United States. We view our copyrights, trade secrets and know-how as a significant component of our intellectual property assets.
We also license certain software from third parties for integration into our solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, unauthorized parties may still attempt to copy, reverse engineer misappropriate or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
Government Regulation
Various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies have legislation pending that could affect our business. In particular, the European Union has passed the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which came into force on May 25, 2018. The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements on entities that receive or process personal data (as compared to existing EU law), along with significant penalties for non-compliance, more robust obligations on data processors and data controllers, greater rights for data subjects (potentially requiring significant changes to both our technology and operations), and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. Similarly, there are a number of federal and state level legislative proposals in the United States that could impose new obligations on us. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, which creates new individual privacy rights for consumers and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling the personal data of consumers or households. When it goes into effect on January 1, 2020, the CCPA will require covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, which could include certain of our employees based on the broad definitions in the law, to provide such consumers new ways to opt out of certain sales of personal information and to allow for a new causes of action for data breaches. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing more onerous data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or other requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
Like other U.S.-based IT security products, our products are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, specifically the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, U.S. economic and trade sanctions regulations and applicable foreign government import, export and use requirements. Certain of our products are subject to encryption controls under the EAR due to the nature of the product and its use or incorporation of encryption functionality. Under 
the encryption controls in the EAR, applicable products may only be exported outside of the United States with required export authorizations, such as a license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. In addition to the restrictions under the EAR, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the export of products and services to countries, governments, entities or persons subject to U.S. embargoes or trade sanctions.
Employees and Culture
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,252 employees, including 329 employees located outside of the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We believe in upholding a core set of values for our entire global workforce:

• | One Tenable: We are united as one Tenable team. We win together. We are one team internally, with our customers, with our partners and in the market.


• | We Care: About our work, about our customers, about one another and about our communities. We speak straight and we do the right thing.


• | Deliver Results: We set high goals, take bold risks, measure honestly and deliver results that exceed expectations.


• | What We Do Matters: The work that we do makes a difference in the world.
