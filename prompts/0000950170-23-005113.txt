Overview
We are a leading clinical-stage precision oncology company enabled by our proprietary synthetic lethality approach to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics. Synthetic lethality, or SL, represents a clinically validated approach to drug development. We use our proprietary, genome-wide, CRISPR-enabled SNIPRx platform to systematically discover and develop highly targeted cancer therapies focused on genomic instability, including DNA damage repair. SL arises when a deficiency in either of two genes is tolerated in cells, but simultaneous deficiencies in both genes cause cell death. Cancer cells that contain a mutation in one gene of a SL pair are susceptible to therapeutic intervention targeting the other gene pair. Using our SNIPRx platform, we are developing our pipeline of SL product candidates, including our initial product candidate, camonsertib (RP-3500 or RG6526), a potent and selective oral small molecule inhibitor of ATR (Ataxia-Telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein kinase) for the treatment of solid tumors with specific DNA damage repair-related genomic alterations, including those in the ATM gene (ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase). In July 2020, we began dosing patients in our Phase 1/2 TRESR (Treatment Enabled by SNIPRx) clinical trial of camonsertib in advanced solid tumors and, in August 2021, we began dosing patients in our Phase 1b/2 ATTACC clinical trial of camonsertib to evaluate the safety and efficacy of camonsertib in combination with approved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, or PARP, inhibitors, olaparib and niraparib, in patients with molecularly selected cancers. We signed a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Roche for the development and commercialization of camonsertib in June 2022, which resulted in a $125 million upfront payment and up to an additional $1.172 billion in potential development, regulatory, commercial and sales milestones, plus royalties on global net product sales.
In April 2021, we initiated our Phase 1 MYTHIC clinical trial for RP-6306, our PKMYT1 (Protein Kinase Membrane-associated tyrosine- and threonine- specific cdc-2 inhibitory kinase) SL inhibitor, as a monotherapy for the treatment of molecularly selected advanced solid tumors, and anticipate early Phase 1 read-outs from the trial in the first half of 2023. We initiated Phase 1 combination studies of RP-6306 with gemcitabine (MAGNETIC) in December 2021, camonsertib (MYTHIC) in May 2022, and FOLFIRI (MINOTAUR) in August 2022, each for the treatment of molecularly selected advanced solid tumors, and anticipate providing an update on some of these combination studies in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we received fast track designation for RP-6306 in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of adult patients with CCNE1 amplified, or FBXW7, or PPP2R1A mutated platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Based on promising preclinical data released at the 34th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium in October 2022, we are working with clinical investigators to initiate clinical testing, as part of an investigator-sponsored trial (IST), of a fourth new RP-6306 combination with carboplatin, with first patient dosing expected in the first half of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement with Canadian Cancer Trials Group, or CCTG, for a planned, basket Phase 2 IST to evaluate RP-6306 in patients with selected, advanced cancers receiving standard agents. We plan to modify the trial to include a sub-study, which will evaluate RP-6306 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with CD4/6i-resistant ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.
We continue to focus on the advancement of our preclinical programs into clinical development. We expect to initiate IND-enabling studies in the first half of 2023 for a small molecule against an undisclosed target with potential to enter the clinic in late 2023 or early 2024, which represents an acceleration from our prior expectations for this program. We are also pursuing development of an inhibitor of polymerase theta (Polθ) in collaboration with Ono, as Polθ is SL with multiple gene deficiencies found in tumors, including BRCA alterations. In 2022, we selected a proposed inhibitor, which we designated as RP-2119. In February 2023, based on our review of ongoing preclinical studies, we elected to prioritize other Polθ inhibiting compounds in our preclinical development portfolio, which we believe have a higher probability for clinical impact relative to RP-2119. We are now guiding toward clinical entry for a Polθ inhibitor in 2024.
 We believe our powerful SL-based approach to the development of new precision oncology therapeutics has multiple potential benefits:

•Ability to address previously untargetable tumor biology, including, for example, loss-of-function mutations; 
 •Enhanced benefit-risk profile, by precisely targeting tumor cells with the defined mutation while sparing normal, non-cancerous cells; 
 •Genetic stratification of patients, potentially enabling higher response rates; and 
 •Tumor-agnostic approach, focusing on specific genetics and enabling the application to multiple tumor types. 
 A cornerstone of our company is our SNIPRx platform, which enables us to accurately identify SL gene pairs and the corresponding patients who are most likely to benefit from our therapies based on the genetic profile of their tumors. These differentiated patient selection insights have driven the development of our initial product candidate, camonsertib, which is designed as a selective inhibitor of the DNA repair protein ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein, or ATR, a kinase that is activated by DNA replication stress. Tumors containing alterations in genes encoding other DNA repair proteins, such as ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase, or ATM, are SL with ATR inhibition and were observed to be hypersensitive to camonsertib in our preclinical models. We believe that the preclinical selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties of camonsertib support the profile of a differentiated therapy with the potential to enhance anti-tumor activity as compared to third party ATR inhibitors currently in development. Based on our preclinical studies, we believe camonsertib has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit to identified patient populations both as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, or PARP, inhibitors.
We are developing a portfolio of product candidates based on targets identified using our SNIPRx platform to treat cancers with a high unmet medical need. Our second designated program, RP-6306, is focused on a novel target we discovered to be SL with amplification of cyclin E1, or CCNE1, or deleterious alterations in FBXW7, or PPP2R1A in tumors such as gynecological, colorectal and upper gastrointestinal malignancies.
 The core of our SNIPRx platform is the ability to identify both known and novel SL targets. Our SNIPRx platform begins with a genome-wide CRISPR-based screening approach that utilizes our proprietary isogenic cell lines, which are cell lines that are identical with the exception of a single genomic alteration, to identify SL gene pairs. Our systematic and comprehensive screening approach has been optimized to significantly reduce false negatives, providing the opportunity to identify a larger and more accurate set of SL interactions as compared to what others have reported with CRISPR-based screening technologies.
We have systematically analyzed genomic data from approximately 60,000 tumor samples and identified a set of clinically relevant tumor genomic alterations, which we refer to as tumor lesions, that are linked to genomic instability. The initial tumor lesions are present in approximately 30% of tumors. For each of these tumor lesions, we have completed a SNIPRx screen campaign to identify both previously reported and unreported targets that are SL with the tumor lesion of the campaign. The majority of our SNIPRx screen campaigns have identified multiple potential targets, which allows us to prioritize and select targets based on their potential to be amenable to small molecule inhibitors with drug-like properties. Once a SL product candidate is identified, we perform our proprietary SNIPRx Targeted Expansion of Patient Populations, or STEP2, screens to identify additional genomic alterations that are SL to our product candidate. Using these screens, we are able to enrich the patient population in our clinical trials and expand the patient populations that may be addressable with our product candidates.
We are a leader in developing innovative SL therapies and have built our SNIPRx platform based on three primary pillars:
1.Identify novel SL targets using our proprietary, genome-wide, CRISPR-enabled screening technology against clinically relevant genomic alterations in tumors with high unmet medical need; 
 2.Design and synthesize potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of these targets; and 
 3.Expand beyond the initial target population based on the additional genomic alterations identified by our proprietary STEP2 screens that are SL with our inhibitors.

Our Pipeline
We are leveraging our proprietary SNIPRx platform to discover, validate and build a robust pipeline of SL-based therapeutics. Our current pipeline is represented in the diagram below.
Our Corporate History and Team
Our company was founded in 2016 by field-leading academics and Versant Ventures to systematically employ SL insights and platforms and develop new precision oncology medicines. Our co-founder, Daniel Durocher, Ph.D., a principal investigator at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, was an early pioneer of genome-wide, SL screening using CRISPR, which formed the framework for our SNIPRx platform. Our other co-founders, Agnel Sfeir, Ph.D. now at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Frank Sicheri, Ph.D. at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, also played a key role in the development of our company.
We have assembled a highly qualified management team with broad experience in drug discovery and development to execute on our mission to develop novel precision oncology therapies based on SL. Our scientific co-founders and members of our management team collectively have extensive experience in oncology drug discovery and development and are pioneers in the SL field. Our management team includes industry veterans with prior experience at companies such as Pfizer, AstraZeneca, GSK, Merck, Eli Lilly and Company, Bicycle Therapeutics, Y-mAbs Therapeutics, Santhera Pharmaceuticals and Clementia Pharmaceuticals. We have an experienced research and development team focused on leveraging our deep expertise and differentiated know-how across genomic target identification, target prioritization and selection, drug discovery chemistry and clinical development to develop highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitors based on SL for the treatment of cancer.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading biopharmaceutical company developing precision oncology, small molecule therapies based on SL. The key elements of our strategy are to:
 •Advance our initial product candidate, camonsertib, by completing ongoing clinical development and supporting collaboration partner Roche in driving broad global development and commercialization. We designed camonsertib to have a highly selective and potent profile that may enable it to be a leading inhibitor of ATR, if approved, that is further leveraged by our differentiated STEP2 patient selection approach. In July 2020, we began monotherapy dosing in our open-label Phase 1/2 clinical trial. In parallel with the monotherapy dose-escalation portion of the trial, in February 2021, we initiated patient recruitment of the combination therapy arm to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
 7


camonsertib in combination with a PARP inhibitor, talazoparib in the same patient subgroups. In August 2021, we initiated patient recruitment in our open-label Phase 1b/2 ATTACC trial of camonsertib in combination with niraparib and olaparib, two additional PARP inhibitors. In October 2021, we presented initial Phase 1 monotherapy clinical data from our open-label Phase 1/2 TRESR trial of camonsertib in patients with solid tumors. We then presented comprehensive Phase 1 monotherapy clinical data from this trial in April 2022. In June 2022, we announced a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Roche for the development and commercialization of camonsertib for the treatment of tumors with specific synthetic-lethal genomic alterations. Under the terms of collaboration, Roche assumes all subsequent development of camonsertib with the potential to expand development into additional tumor indications and multiple combination studies.
 •Advance RP-6306 through clinical development by leveraging our differentiated STEP2 patient selection approach. We designed RP-6306 to be a first-in-class, highly selective and potent small-molecule, oral inhibitor of PKMYT1, which is a novel target that we discovered to be synthetic lethal with CCNE1 amplification and other deleterious genetic alterations. In April 2021, we began dosing patients in our open-label Phase 1 MYTHIC trial of RP-6306 designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP-6306 in advanced solid tumors that are characterized by genomic alterations predicted by our SNIPRx platform to be sensitive to RP-6306. In December 2021, we enrolled the first patient in our open-label Phase 1 MAGNETIC trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP-6306 in combination with gemcitabine. In January 2022, we initiated patient recruitment in our open-label Phase 1 MINOTAUR trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP-6306 in combination with FOLFIRI. In May 2022, we initiated patient recruitment in a new arm of the Phase 1 MYTHIC clinical trial, which is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP-6306 in combination with camonsertib in patients with advanced solid tumors. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we received fast track designation for RP-6306 in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of adult patients with CCNE1 amplified, or FBXW7 or PPP2R1A mutated platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Based on promising preclinical data released at the 34th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium in October 2022, we are working with clinical investigators to initiate clinical testing of a new carboplatin combination with RP-6306 that is expected to dose the first patient in the first half of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement with CCTG for a planned, basket Phase 2 IST to evaluate RP-6306 in patients with selected, advanced cancers receiving standard agents. A sub-study under the master protocol will evaluate RP-6306 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with CD4/6i-resistant ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We plan to provide an initial Phase 1 clinical data readout for RP-6306 in the first half of 2023 for monotherapy, and anticipate providing an update on some of the combination studies in the fourth quarter of 2023.
 •Continue to advance our preclinical programs into clinical development. In addition to camonsertib and RP-6306, we have several programs in preclinical development. We expect to initiate IND-enabling studies in the first half of 2023 for a small molecule against an undisclosed target with potential to enter the clinic in late 2023 or early 2024, which represents an acceleration from our prior expectations for this program. We are also pursuing development of an inhibitor of polymerase theta (Polθ) in collaboration with Ono, as Polθ is SL with multiple gene deficiencies found in tumors, including BRCA alterations. In 2022, we selected a proposed inhibitor, which we designated as RP-2119, and initiated IND-enabling studies. In January 2023, we amended our research services, license and collaboration agreement, or the Ono Agreement, with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Ono, to extend the research term until July 31, 2023. In the first quarter of 2023, we received an approximate $1.5 million (¥200 million) research service payment from Ono due to the achievement of a specified research trigger for our Polθ program, under the companies’ 2019 agreement. In February 2023, based on our review of ongoing preclinical studies, we elected to prioritize other Polθ inhibiting compounds in our preclinical development portfolio, which we believe have a higher probability for clinical impact relative to RP-2119. We are now guiding toward clinical entry for a Polθ inhibitor in 2024. 
 •Extend our leading position in SL drug discovery. We have systematically analyzed genomic data from approximately 60,000 tumor samples and have identified a set of tumor lesions that are linked to genomic instability. This current set of tumor lesions provides us with the opportunity to be among the first to mine this substantial, largely non-overlapping genomic space for new SL gene pairs and develop a robust portfolio of novel targeted therapeutics. We intend to continue leveraging our leading position in the identification of novel oncology SL gene pairs and systematically applying our STEP2 screens to expand 


the addressable patient populations for each of our product candidates. We believe our approach will allow us to continue to build a sustainable and long-term pipeline of novel product candidates for the targeted treatment of cancers with high unmet medical need.
 •Opportunistically pursue strategic partnerships to maximize the full potential of our pipeline and SNIPRx platform. The large number of pre-existing mutations affecting genomic stability in tumors combined with the high throughput of our SNIPRx platform has the potential to provide us with an abundance of novel targets. We believe this provides the opportunity to selectively enter into strategic partnerships and leverage our partners’ complementary capabilities. We regularly evaluate the potential of partnerships and other collaborative efforts to maximize the long-term value of our portfolio. We believe our collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb highlights the potential broad application of our platform in the search for the next generation of precision oncology medicines.
 Background
Targeted Oncology Therapeutics
The first-generation of approved targeted therapies were predominately directed at driver mutations, which target specific types of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as, bcr-abl, EGFR and HER2, and have largely represented the focus of the targeted oncology sector for the last 20 years. A rapid evolution in the understanding of tumor biology coupled with an improved ability to segment subsets of tumors based on genomic alterations have led to the development of new generations of targeted cancer therapies for a variety of additional tumor-specific genomic abnormalities.
Targeting DNA repair genes and specifically loss of function alterations is an emerging area of research with PARP inhibitors pioneering the field. The growing number of compounds in development and multiple clinical studies have begun to reveal patterns of clinical benefit alone and in combination with several other agents. We expect both monotherapy and combination trials with these agents to emerge quickly and reshape the therapeutic landscape across many disease areas. Consistent with this trend and the specific cell cycle-related mechanisms of action for our lead assets, we have initiated comprehensive development plans for camonsertib and RP-6306 alone or in combination with multiple agents.
 The speed at which the field has identified genetic changes associated with tumors has outpaced the discovery and development of precision medicines that can target those alterations. Oncology drug development has been primarily focused on genes with readily druggable alterations that confer new or enhanced protein activity, known as gain-of-function targets, such as EGFR. These include both gain-of-function alterations, such as CCNE1, as well as loss-of-function alterations, such as BRCA1. In June 2019, the New England Journal of Medicine referred to SL as a particularly attractive means to target the complex and gene-network oriented relationships associated with this previously undiscovered domain of oncology targets.
The more recent ability to identify a tumor’s genetic vulnerabilities and networks of genes responsible for more complex gene functions underlying many cancers has been enabled through new and disruptive technical breakthroughs in the field including:
•Clinically-relevant tumor genomic data: the increasing adoption and regulatory acceptance of molecular tumor testing, enabling the accurate profiling of patient tumors; 
 •Consolidated and annotated databases: the availability of multiple new and publicly accessible databases that consolidate, analyze, and synthesize new genetic data on tens of thousands of tumors; and 
 •Tools to apply emerging genetic knowledge: the emergence of new tools and methodologies, including CRISPR/Cas9, enabling large-scale studies of genetic networks underlying cancer biology. 
 The Synthetic Lethality Opportunity and Challenge
Synthetic lethality is a powerful approach and opportunity in oncology drug development that combines two key principles in treating patients with cancer through precision oncology: (1) identifying and selecting patient

subgroups with specific genomic alterations in tumors that are most likely to benefit from these therapies and (2) improving tolerability and reducing toxicity by not affecting normal, non-cancerous cells.
SL arises when deficiencies in a pair of genes occur simultaneously to result in cell death, but if that deficiency exists in only one gene, the cell will survive. As depicted below, cancer cells that contain an alteration in one gene of a SL pair are susceptible to therapeutic intervention targeting the other gene pair, resulting in cell death, whereas normal cells are not affected by the inhibition of the targeted gene and remain viable.
Illustration of Synthetic Lethality Approach
 


The first clinically-validated SL gene pair was PARP-BRCA1/2, and based on the efficacy of PARP inhibitors, the SL approach to treating cancer has achieved substantial commercial validation. PARP enzymes regulate critical DNA repair pathways that cancer cells rely on as they grow and divide. PARP inhibition blocks these pathways, preventing DNA repair in cancer cells with a BRCA1/2 alteration and resulting in cancer cell death while sparing normal cells. Multiple PARP inhibitors, including olaparib (AstraZeneca), niraparib (GlaxoSmithKline), talazoparib (Pfizer), rucaparib (Clovis) and pamiparib (Beigene), have been approved for the treatment of tumors with BRCA and other DNA damage repair alterations, including ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers.
While SL offers a new route to uncover important gene targets for the treatment of cancers, identifying these SL gene pairs has been a challenge due to the lack of systematic, prospective, and large-scale methods to capture and exploit these gene-gene relationships for new drug discovery and development.
Our Approach: An Overview of Our Drug Discovery and Development Platform
Our SNIPRx platform integrates our deep expertise and differentiated know-how across genomic target identification, target prioritization and selection, drug discovery chemistry and clinical development. Our approach can be divided into six steps, as depicted in the graphic below.
Our Integrated Approach to Drug Discovery and Development



1. Select tumor lesion of interest.
Apply our deep understanding of tumor lesions with a bias for alterations associated with genomic instability and cancers with high unmet medical need.
Since 2016, we have systematically analyzed genomic data from approximately 60,000 tumor samples. We consult with leading oncology clinicians and key advisors to identify cancer types and subtypes where the current standard of care is not adequately improving patient survival. We then prioritize genetic lesions based on various criteria including mutation frequency and the feasibility of identifying lesion-positive patients. Of those, we focus on lesions that are known to directly or indirectly impact processes involved in genomic instability, such as DNA repair and cell cycle regulation.
2. Execute SNIPRx screen campaign.
Utilize our SNIPRx screening technology to identify target gene candidates that induce SL in the context of our set of tumor lesions.
For each of the tumor lesions we identified, each of which we refer to as an original tumor lesion, we have completed a screen campaign utilizing CRISPR technology and other tools to create proprietary isogenic cell lines, which are pairs of cell lines that are identical with the exception of a single genomic alteration. This allows us to identify, on a genome-wide basis, both known and novel targets that are SL with each original tumor lesion. Our SNIPRx platform has been optimized to both sensitivity and reproducibility, resulting in a significant decrease in false negatives compared to what has been reported with other CRISPR-based screening technologies.
3. Prioritize, select, and validate druggable targets.
Evaluate the multiple SL targets identified for each original tumor lesion.
Our screen campaigns result in the identification of multiple SL targets for each original tumor lesion. We prioritize and select targets to advance into drug discovery based on a systematic and proprietary set of criteria, which include thresholds for biological validation, cellular function, known and likely toxicity, druggability with small molecules, patentability, and the potential for clinical impact versus alternative therapies. Our processes include extensive in vitro, genetic, and in vivo animal validation of targets and comprehensive development of tool compounds for initial pharmacological corroboration.

4. Develop potent and selective inhibitors.
Develop small molecule product candidates that are highly potent and selective and advance them from lead discovery through the identification of a clinical candidate.
We have assembled an internal research team that has extensive experience in small molecule drug discovery with a proven track record of identifying development candidates and delivering them into and through the clinic. Our team has deep in-house capabilities in cell biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, enzymology, medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, and molecular modeling. We also have proven capabilities in drug metabolism, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics, and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion evaluation, as well as pharmacology, including dedicated in vivo animal facilities to internally drive translational studies for human clinical trials. We believe these capabilities were demonstrated in the discovery and development of camonsertib and RP-6306.
5. Perform SNIPRx Targeted Expansion of Patient Populations (STEP2) screens.
Expand our potential patient populations beyond those identified by the original SL pair.
Once we have identified a clinical candidate, our STEP2 screens utilize a set of cell lines that, when treated with our clinical candidate, elucidate genes that, when knocked down, cause sensitivity to our selected inhibitor. These screens not only confirm the SL relationship with the original tumor lesion, but also identify additional genomic alterations that confer a response to our product candidates and are mutually exclusive from the original tumor lesion. We believe the identification of these new SL pairs allows us to rationally expand our targeted patient populations by enabling us to potentially treat patients with tumors across multiple genomic alterations with the same product candidate.
6. Conduct clinical trials in an enriched patient population.
Design our clinical trials for efficient clinical development.
For our clinical trials, we plan to enroll patients with tumors that contain either the original tumor lesion or any one of the genomic alterations identified by our STEP2 screens. We believe this strategy will allow us to enroll only those patients who are most likely to achieve clinical benefit from our product candidates. In addition, we are prioritizing tumor types for which there are no effective therapies currently available. We plan to evaluate multiple cohorts of patients based on specific genomic alterations, which may enable us to pursue an accelerated regulatory approval pathway for certain targeted patient populations.
Our SNIPRx Platform
The core of our SNIPRx platform is the ability to identify both known and novel SL targets. We believe that our platform and approach provide many key advantages as highlighted below.
•Designed to Address Previously Untargetable Tumor Biology. Oncology drug development has been primarily focused on genes with readily druggable alterations that confer new or enhanced protein activity, known as gain-of-function targets, such as EGFR. The remaining targets have historically been considered undruggable. These include both gain-of-function alterations, such as CCNE1, as well as loss-of-function alterations, such as BRCA1. Our SNIPRx platform has demonstrated an ability to identify novel SL relationships, including those that address previously untargetable tumor biology. 
 •Applies Our Proprietary Genome-wide Library. Genome-scale screens often identify many genes coding for the same protein complex or cellular pathway, thereby increasing confidence in those hits. These screens allow us to screen the entire genome to determine the top hits across all genes, as compared to the more limited druggable gene libraries. In addition, because the definition of what is druggable is continuously evolving, by using genome-scale screens, we are able to mine the results of our existing screens as new therapeutic modalities emerge. Our genome-wide libraries, together with our industrialized and optimized screening approach and technology, result in a significant reduction in false negative hits. 


•Utilizes Isogenic Cell Lines. We believe a key differentiator of our SNIPRx platform is the utilization of thoroughly characterized proprietary isogenic cell lines for our CRISPR-based genome-wide SL screen campaigns. We use normal, non-cancerous cell lines to engineer our isogenic cell models, which enable us to mine for SL interactions between two genes in models with clean genetic backgrounds that have minimal mutations and normal chromosome numbers. We have also developed a proprietary computational algorithm that is specifically designed to identify SL interactions from our isogenic screens. We believe using isogenic cell lines gives us a significant competitive advantage since most SL screening approaches used by others are based on cancer cell line panels, which we believe are less accurate due to their propensity to result in variable data. 
 •Focuses on Niche of Genomic Instability. Based on the well-established network of SL interactions in DNA synthesis and repair across model organisms, we have found and believe we will continue to find clear and reproducible SL interactions through our SNIPRx platform. Genomic instability is an early event that underlies all cancer, and many of the genes we screen represent early hits in cancer that may have less heterogeneity in later stage tumors. The genomic instability space is enriched with genes encoding enzymatic activity, which provides us with ample opportunity to identify novel druggable genes for development into small molecule precision oncology therapies. We believe developing product candidates that target genomic instability may lead to durable responses with resulting clinical benefits for patients. 
 One example that illustrates the power of our SNIPRx platform is a SL screen campaign that we conducted in an isogenic pair of cell lines in which one cell line had a BRCA1 mutation and the other cell line was normal for BRCA1. The results of this screen campaign are graphically depicted below. The top-right quadrant of Graphic A highlights the SL hits resulting from our screen and shows that we were able to identify PARP1 as a SL hit with BRCA1. In addition, two additional sets of genes were identified to be SL with BRCA1: (1) the genes encoding the Fanconi Anemia pathway, which are depicted in purple, and (2) the genes coding for the BLM-RMI1-RMI2 complex, which are depicted in green. The independent identification by our SNIPRx screen campaign of multiple genes within a pathway or complex greatly increases confidence that those are true SL hits. In contrast, external cell panel screens that look for SL hits by comparing a panel of cancer cell lines that have either BRCA1-mutant or normal BRCA1 cell lines do not identify these validated BRCA1 SL genes. As shown in Graphic B below, multiple cancer cell line panel screens utilizing CRISPR or shRNA all failed to identify PARP1 as a SL hit with BRCA1.

Our Clinical Stage Product Candidates
 Camonsertib, Also Known as RP-3500 or RG6526, an Oral ATR Inhibitor
 Overview
Our initial clinical-stage product candidate, camonsertib, is a potent and selective oral small molecule inhibitor of ATR that we are developing for the treatment of tumors with mutations in ATM, which is a SL pair with ATR. ATR is a critical DNA damage response, or DDR, protein that acts as both the master regulator of the response to DNA replication stress, as well as a central effector of the DNA damage checkpoint. Based on the previously published SL relationship between ATR and ATM, ATR has been the target of prior drug discovery efforts, and ATR inhibitors in development have demonstrated promising, durable clinical responses in a small number of patients in early clinical trials. Through our STEP2 screens, we believe that we have more precisely identified and expanded the patient populations that would benefit from camonsertib, which allows us to differentiate and enrich our clinical development strategy as well as address multiple types of solid tumors.
Camonsertib has demonstrated an optimized anti-tumor effect, selectivity, and pharmacokinetics profile in preclinical studies that we believe supports the potential for it to be a leading ATR inhibitor, if approved. We also conducted multiple STEP2 screens in which we confirmed the SL relationship between ATR and ATM and identified an additional 19 genes that are also SL with ATR, potentially expanding the patient populations that may benefit from our product candidate. In July 2020, we began dosing in our open-label Phase 1/2 clinical trial of camonsertib in patients with advanced tumors that have alterations in the ATM gene or a subset of 16 additional genetic alterations identified through our STEP2 screens. We believe the design of our trial allows us to enrich the patient population in our trials with those who are most likely to respond to camonsertib. In parallel with the monotherapy dose-escalation portion of the trial, in February 2021 we initiated patient recruitment of the combination therapy arm to evaluate the safety and efficacy of camonsertib in combination with a PARP inhibitor, talazoparib in the same patient subgroups. In August 2021, we initiated patient recruitment in our open-label Phase 1b/2 ATTACC trial of camonsertib in combination with niraparib and olaparib, two additional PARP inhibitors. In October 2021, we presented initial Phase 1 monotherapy clinical data from our open-label Phase 1/2 TRESR trial in patients with solid tumors at the AACRA-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. The presentation included the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule choice and confirmed camonsertib activity in tumors with alterations hypothesized by our SNIPRx platform.
In April 2022, we presented comprehensive Phase 1 monotherapy clinical data from the TRESR Phase 1/2 trial, reflecting analysis of 120 patients, of which 99 patients were evaluable for efficacy as of the data cutoff date of February 14, 2022 (excluding one patient evaluated as of March 22, 2022). The study included 95 patients who received therapeutically active doses or at the recommended Phase 2 dose schedule of 3 days on / 4 days off, and reflecting the data cutoff of mid-February 2022. Monotherapy with camonsertib continued to appear safe and well tolerated. Anemia was the most common treatment-related adverse event and easily manageable. Only 24.2% of all patients in the 3 days on / 4 days off schedule experienced Grade 3 anemia, and none experienced Grade 4 anemia. Camonsertib monotherapy resulted in durable clinical benefit across tumor types and genomic alterations, with
14


enriched benefit demonstrated in specific patient subsets. These updated monotherapy results showed a 43% clinical benefit rate, or CBR, which was defined as response or treatment duration of at least 16 weeks without progression, an overall response rate of 14%, and a median progression free survival, or mPFS, of 15 weeks in solid tumors across genotypes, with potential best-in-class safety and tolerability. The overall CBR in patients after PARP inhibitor failure was 47%. We observed camonsertib demonstrated robust activity in patients with ovarian cancer (n=20), demonstrating 75% CBR after dosing with camonsertib, an overall response rate of 25%, and a mPFS of 35 weeks. The ovarian cancer patient population was heavily pretreated and comprised a hard to treat population: of which 90% had previous treatment with PARP inhibitors and 85% were platinum resistant. The responders included one complete response, three partial responses as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, and one durable and ongoing CA-125 response in a patient with stable disease. The TRESR study comprises the largest set of tumors with detailed genomic analysis evaluated with ATR inhibitor, or ATRi, monotherapy. Genomic subsets of tumors beyond ATM included tumors harboring alterations in ATR-sensitizing genes, with responses observed in tumors harboring BRCA1/2, SETD2 and RAD51C alterations. In patients with BRCA1/2 mutated tumors (n = 37), response rate was 14% and included two patients with ovarian cancer, and one each with breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. In patients with tumors carrying BRCA1 mutations, the CBR was 48%. In patients with tumors with ATM loss-of-function, or LOF (n = 34), response rate was 9% including one RECIST 1.1 confirmed/unconfirmed response, and two prostate specific antigen responses. An additional patient with pancreatic cancer and ATM LOF had a late response, just after the data cutoff after 54 weeks of treatment. The CBR in the patients with ATM LOF was 44% and mPFS was 17 weeks. Sequencing data demonstrated biallelic gene LOF, an emerging biomarker for synthetic lethal therapies, could potentially be leveraged to further enrich for patients most likely to benefit from camonsertib. CBR in patients with biallelic LOF was significantly higher (47%) compared to the CBR in patients with non-biallelic tumors (15%). 
In June 2022, we announced a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Roche for the development and commercialization of camonsertib for the treatment of tumors with specific synthetic-lethal genomic alterations. Under the terms of the collaboration, Roche assumes all subsequent development of camonsertib with the potential to expand development into additional tumor indications and multiple combination studies. Under the terms of the agreement, we received a $125 million upfront payment in July 2022, and are eligible to receive up to $1.2 billion in potential clinical, regulatory, commercial and sales milestones, including up to $55 million in potential near-term payments, and royalties on global net sales ranging from high-single-digits to high-teens. The collaboration also provides our company with the ability to opt-in to a 50/50 U.S. co-development and profit share arrangement, including participation in U.S. co-promotion if U.S. regulatory approval is received. If we choose to exercise the co-development and profit share option, we will continue to be eligible to receive certain clinical, regulatory, commercial and sales milestone payments, in addition to full ex-U.S. royalties.
 Mechanism of Action
ATR is a protein kinase that acts at multiple levels of the DDR network. It is activated when problems with ongoing DNA replication are identified, a phenomenon known as DNA replication stress. It uses its kinase activity to stabilize the DNA replication machinery locally and to suppress the initiation of DNA replication globally. As a consequence, ATR prevents the formation of DNA damage when DNA replication is stressed. In addition to these roles, ATR also restrains cell cycle progression when it is activated, a phenomenon known as the DNA damage checkpoint. ATR is one member of an extensive network of proteins that serve to recognize early stages of DNA damage, prevent replication from proceeding through these damaged sites and repair the damage. Cancer cells with alterations in genes encoding this network of DDR proteins are highly dependent on ATR for survival. ATR’s central role in the regulation of replication stress has led to the development of multiple ATR inhibitors that have demonstrated durable responses in early clinical trials.
The ATR Partner Genes and Proposed Synthetic Lethality Pairs
ATM is a DDR protein related to ATR that is responsible for sensing and signaling DNA double-strand breaks. Our ATR inhibitor STEP2 screen campaigns confirmed that ATM-deficient cells rely on ATR activity for survival. ATM orchestrates the response to double-strand break repair and thus, ATM-deficient tumors have an impaired response to DNA breaks. SL screens conducted in our laboratories have identified that at least 16 additional genes are SL with ATR inhibition, making cancer cells that are deficient in those genes highly sensitive to killing by ATR

inhibitors. An overview of the ATM-ATR SL relationship, as one of the examples of the sensitivity genes, is illustrated below.
Mechanism of ATM-ATR Synthetic Lethality



The gene encoding for ATM is frequently mutated in cancer. An analysis of sequence data collected as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas, or TCGA, found that between 1% and 4% of solid tumors, such as breast, bladder, pancreatic and lung cancers, have deficiencies in ATM, as depicted in the graphs below. Beyond ATM, 16 of 19 additional, mutually exclusive genomic alterations identified as SL with camonsertib, with average prevalence of approximately 10% across multiple tumors, were eligible for recruitment into clinical trials.




Clinical Validation of ATR Inhibitors in ATM-Deficient Tumors and in Other Genetic Backgrounds Hypothesized to Sensitize Tumors to ATRi
Early phase studies evaluating third party ATR inhibitors as a monotherapy support the rationale for prospective patient selection for tumors carrying genomic alterations hypothesized to sensitize tumors ATR inhibition. A Phase 1 of Bayer’s ATR inhibitor suggested antitumor activity in solid tumors with certain DDR defects, including ATM loss (Yap, Cancer Discovery 2020). The subsequent dose expansion cohort enrolled an additional 143 patients, prospectively selected for presence of DDR gene defects. While the overall response rate was low (4%), durable responses were observed in tumors with ATM or BRCA mutations (Yap, AACR 2022). In addition, out of a cohort of 17 patients receiving EMD’s ATR inhibitor, the single responder was a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer with loss of ATM (Yap, JCO 2020). 
The Phase 1/2 TRESR study prospectively selected for patients with tumors carrying DNA damage repair loss-of-function mutations predicted to sensitize to camonsertib. Following our first clinical data release at the AACR-ASCO-NCI meeting in October 2021, we presented comprehensive Phase 1 monotherapy data from this study at the AACR annual conference in April 2022. Camonsertib monotherapy resulted in durable responses across tumor types and genomic alterations, including ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, CDK12, and SETD2. Antitumor activity was validated by molecular responses in 41% of evaluable patients.
In June 2022, we announced a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Roche for the development and commercialization of camonsertib, which provided further validation of our clinical program through the addition of a strategic partner with a leading global footprint and unique expertise in precision oncology.
Our Solution, Camonsertib
We identified ATR as one of the SL targets through our SNIPRx screen campaign of ATM and selected ATR as a target for our initial product candidate, camonsertib, based on:
(i)existing third party clinical and preclinical support for the potential of ATR inhibition as a precision oncology therapy; 
 (ii)our ability to design an ATR inhibitor with enhanced chemical properties, such as potency and selectivity; and 
 (iii)the results of our STEP2 screens, which identified 19 additional genomic alterations beyond ATM deficiency to be SL with ATR, facilitating the expansion of the addressable patient populations. 
 We designed camonsertib as an oral small molecule ATR inhibitor with increased potency and a similar or improved selectivity profile compared to other known ATR inhibitors. Camonsertib has demonstrated a favorable
17


pharmacokinetic profile in multiple preclinical models, including rodent and canine, and a distribution, metabolism and excretion profile that suggests a low potential for drug-drug interactions in the clinic. The clinical trial of camonsertib in patients with recurrent cancers is ongoing.
Our STEP2 screens have generated proprietary patient selection insights that we believe provide the rationale to expand the potential patient populations addressable by camonsertib beyond patients with tumors carrying ATM genetic defects. We have identified 19 genomic alterations, in addition to ATM deficiency, that confer sensitivity to camonsertib. This 19 gene set, which we refer to as our STEP2-identified genes, includes several novel genes that have not been previously reported as rendering sensitivity to ATR inhibitors. In addition, many of the genes we have selected do not overlap with previously identified genes in the homologous recombination defect panel, which is utilized to identify patients for treatment with PARP inhibitors and is currently used by others to test for sensitivity to ATR inhibitors. Furthermore, our STEP2 screens demonstrated that two genes previously reported by others to be sensitive to ATR inhibition were not sensitive and hence, those genes were excluded from our set of STEP2-identified genes.
The sensitivity and accuracy of our STEP2 screens enable the identification of several novel gene alterations, including certain genes that are not yet included in commercially available Next Generation Sequencing cancer panels or Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, validated panels used in large academic centers. For our Phase 1/2 clinical trial, we identified and partnered with multiple large, leading clinical centers globally where tumor sequencing is a component of standard of care. These centers’ panels are validated and sufficiently large to accommodate screening for alterations in ATM or our STEP2-identified genes. These panels include the majority, and in the case of whole genome or whole exome sequencing, all of these genes. For genes that are not available on certain panels at a particular clinical site, we identified surrogate genes that are co-deleted with the STEP2 genes and have an approximate 30% to 80% probability of concomitant loss, which we believe has and will provide sufficient enrichment for our clinical trial. By working in collaboration with our clinical partners to access their existing patient databases, we believe that we will be able to efficiently identify existing and new patients who may be eligible for our clinical trial.
Based on the prevalence of ATM deficiencies and our STEP2-identified genomic alterations across various solid tumors, as shown in the graph below, we believe that camonsertib has the potential to benefit a significant number of patients representing a large unmet medical need.
Top 10 Tumor Types with Highest Prevalence of ATM Deficiency
or 16 STEP2 Genomic Alterations


As part of our development strategy for camonsertib, we are evaluating the potential anti-tumor activity of camonsertib in combination with an approved PARP inhibitor based on the synergies we have observed in our
18


preclinical studies. PARP inhibitors lead to the stabilization of PARP-DNA complexes that block the progression of replication forks. ATR activity stabilizes the DNA replication forks that are destabilized by PARP inhibition and inhibition of ATR causes stalled replication forks to collapse and form cytotoxic DNA double-strand breaks. As a consequence, ATR inhibition can potentiate the cytotoxic effects of PARP inhibitors. We note that this phenomenon is particularly prominent under conditions where some cancer-relevant DDR genes, such as those identified through our STEP screens, are inactivated, thereby creating a potential therapeutic window.
Preclinical Data: Monotherapy
We observed camonsertib to have a favorable tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile across multiple preclinical studies and animal models, which we believe supports advancing the product candidate into clinical trials. In a preclinical study, we evaluated continuous daily dosing of camonsertib in a colon cancer xenograft model with CW-2 cancer cells, which contain an inactivating mutation in ATM that confers sensitivity to ATR inhibition. In this study, we injected mice with tumor cells and waited for tumor growth to approximately 200 mm before initiating daily dosing over a period of 14 days with vehicle, camonsertib at its maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, of 10 mg/kg/day, or Bayer’s ATR inhibitor product candidate, BAY1895344, at what we determined to be its MTD of 35 mg/kg/day (n=10 mice per group). Both camonsertib and BAY1895344 demonstrated statistically significant suppression of tumor growth as compared to vehicle. Importantly, we observed statistically significant higher suppression of tumor growth with camonsertib as compared to BAY1895344 (p=0.018). Body weight loss as a measurement of tolerability was similar for both compounds in this study.
Statistically Significant Tumor Growth Suppression in Colon Cancer Model



In another preclinical study using an intermittent dosing schedule, we evaluated camonsertib in comparison to BAY1895344 in a Granta-519 mantle cell lymphoma xenograft model. Similar to CW-2 cancer cells, Granta-519 cancer cells also contain an inactivating mutation in ATM that confers sensitivity to ATR inhibition. In this study, we injected mice with tumor cells and waited for tumor growth to approximately 150 mm3 before initiating intermittent dosing with vehicle or either treatment (n=9 mice per group). We observed that both camonsertib and BAY1895344 exhibited tolerability at higher doses when administered on a three days per week schedule than their respective MTDs from the daily dosing CW-2 colon cancer study. The MTDs utilizing this intermittent dosing schedule were determined to be 30 mg/kg daily for camonsertib and 50 mg/kg twice-daily for BAY1895344. Both agents demonstrated similar and significant suppression of tumor growth in this model without body weight loss. However, significant anemia, or hematocrit reduction, was observed in mice treated with BAY1895344 (p=0.0002), whereas we did not observe these tolerability issues with camonsertib, which we believe supports our hypothesis of a favorable tolerability profile for camonsertib.

Preclinical Data: Combination Therapy with PARP
Of our 19 STEP2-identified genes for camonsertib as a monotherapy, we have identified a subset of genes that are particularly sensitive to the combination of camonsertib and PARP inhibitors. The graphs below illustrate two examples of this subset of genes where synergy was demonstrated between camonsertib and PARP inhibitors.
Significant Synergy Demonstrated by Combination of Camonsertib and PARP Inhibitors



+/+: Wild Type
-/-: Genomically altered
We observed in vitro killing of cells carrying this subset of genomic alterations at low concentrations of both compounds, whereas only a minimal effect was seen on control wild-type cells. Based on this finding, we believe that the combination of camonsertib with lower doses of PARP inhibitors could lead to efficient anti-tumor activity while
20


potentially addressing the tolerability issues observed with PARP inhibitors, where a majority of patients in clinical trials of niraparib and talazoparib required a dose reduction or interruption in dosing. We are currently exploring the ATR-PARP inhibitor synergy in additional ongoing studies in xenograft models.
Preclinical Data: Combination Therapy with Gemcitabine
 Gemcitabine is an antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent that is commonly used in various solid tumors such as pancreatic, breast, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancer. Gemcitabine is metabolized by the tumor cells and incorporated in their DNA, resulting in blockage of DNA polymerases and replication fork stalling. This gemcitabine-induced replication stress increases the tumor cells’ dependency on the ATR pathway and gemcitabine is therefore known to strongly enhance the cytotoxic effects of ATR inhibitors.
 Our preclinical data demonstrate that gemcitabine shows strong synergy with camonsertib in ATM-deficient (ATM-KO) cells, whereas much higher doses are required to achieve the same degree of synergy in ATM-proficient (ATM-WT) cells (Figure A below). Consequently, camonsertib combined with gemcitabine kills ATM-KO cells at low concentrations that show little effect in WT cells (Figure B below). We therefore believe that the combination with gemcitabine may enhance the anti-tumor activity of camonsertib in ATM-deficient cancers at tolerated doses. We are currently evaluating this combination in tumor cells carrying additional STEP2 alterations as well as in animal models.
 Sensitivity of ATM-deficient cells to the combination of camonsertib and gemcitabine
 
Preclinical Validation of STEP2 Screens
Through our STEP2 screens of ATR inhibitors, we confirmed the SL relationship between ATR and ATM and identified an additional 19 genomic alterations that confer sensitivity to camonsertib. In follow-up studies with cancer cell line pairs, in which the only difference is the inactivation of the target genes, we are confirming the sensitivity of these genomic alterations to camonsertib, and this extensive validation effort is still being expanded. We are also creating xenograft models using both the parent cell lines and the inactivated cell line. In such a model using one of
21


the STEP2-identified genes, camonsertib led to statistically significant suppression of tumor growth, whereas it had no anti-tumor effect in tumors created with wild-type parent cells, as shown in the model below.

Camonsertib Clinical Trial Program
 Design of Trials:
In July 2020, we initiated our open-label Phase 1/2 clinical trial of camonsertib as both a monotherapy and in combination with talazoparib, an approved PARP inhibitor. The trial is designed to evaluate the oral administration of camonsertib in patients with advanced recurrent tumors of different histologies with ATM loss-of-function or a subset comprised of 16 of the 19 STEP2-identified genomic alterations, for which recent in-vitro studies suggested a higher confidence of success.
In the ongoing monotherapy dose escalation phase of our trial, we are evaluating the dosing regimen and safety of camonsertib to establish the recommended dose for the expansion phase of the trial. In three expansion cohorts, each of which has been designed to enroll patients based on ATM loss-of-function or different STEP2-identified genomic alterations, we will assess the preliminary efficacy of camonsertib at the recommended dose and schedule. In parallel with the monotherapy dose escalation phase, the trial is designed to enroll a separate arm to evaluate camonsertib in combination with talazoparib, an approved PARP inhibitor. An efficacy evaluation is performed every six weeks for the first five months and every nine weeks thereafter. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have activated twelve clinical trial sites in North America and Europe, all of which are actively enrolling patients. We observed initial signs of biological and clinical activity as monotherapy and evaluated multiple doses and schedules. We established the recommended Phase 2 dose as 160 mg once daily 3 days on / 4 days off, given continuously every week with a tolerability and safety profile that is favorable and the dominant on-target toxicity is anemia. Grade 3 anemia was reported at 15% with no grade 4 anemia and other grade 3 or 4 toxicities were at maximum 5%. Clinical responders were seen across multiple genomic alterations and tumor types. Clinical benefit rate reported at the AACR-ASCP-NCI meeting in October 2021 was 49%. In February 2021, we initiated recruitment of patients for the talazoparib combination arm of the trial. In December 2021 we entered the Phase 2 part of the trial with expansion into specific tumor and genotype cohorts. We reported complete safety and efficacy data for the monotherapy dose escalation phase of the trial at AACR in April 2022.

The design of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial for camonsertib, now partnered with Roche, is summarized in the diagram below.


Full Dataset from the TRESR Phase 1/2 Trial Presented at AACR 2022:
 In April 2022, we presented comprehensive Phase 1 monotherapy clinical data from the TRESR Phase 1/2 trial, reflecting analysis of 120 patients, of which 99 patients were evaluable for efficacy as of the data cutoff date of February 14, 2022 (excluding one patient evaluated as of March 22, 2022). The study included 95 patients who received therapeutically active doses or at the recommended Phase 2 dose schedule of 3 days on / 4 days off, and reflecting the data cutoff of mid-February 2022. Monotherapy with camonsertib continued to appear safe and well tolerated. Anemia was the most common treatment-related adverse event and easily manageable. Only 24.2% of all patients in the 3 days on / 4 days off schedule experienced Grade 3 anemia, and none experienced Grade 4 anemia. Camonsertib monotherapy resulted in durable clinical benefit across tumor types and genomic alterations, with enriched benefit demonstrated in specific patient subsets. These updated monotherapy results showed a 43% CBR, which was defined as response or treatment duration of at least 16 weeks without progression, an overall response rate of 14%, and a mPFS of 15 weeks in solid tumors across genotypes, with potential best-in-class safety and tolerability. The overall CBR in patients after PARP inhibitor failure was 47%.
We observed camonsertib demonstrated robust activity in patients with ovarian cancer (n=20), demonstrating 75% CBR after dosing with camonsertib, an overall response rate of 25%, and a mPFS of 35 weeks. The ovarian cancer patient population was heavily pretreated and comprised a hard to treat population: of which 90% had previous treatment with PARP inhibitors and 85% were platinum resistant. The responders included one complete response, three partial responses as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, and one durable and ongoing CA-125 response in a patient with stable disease.
The TRESR study comprises the largest set of tumors with detailed genomic analysis evaluated with ATRi monotherapy. Genomic subsets of tumors beyond ATM included tumors harboring alterations in ATR-sensitizing genes, with responses observed in tumors harboring BRCA1/2, SETD2 and RAD51C alterations. In patients with BRCA1/2 mutated tumors (n = 37), response rate was 14% and included two patients with ovarian cancer, and one each with breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. In patients with tumors carrying BRCA1 mutations, the CBR was 48%. In patients with tumors with ATM loss-of-function, or LOF, (n = 34), response rate was 9% including one RECIST 1.1 confirmed/unconfirmed response, and two prostate specific antigen responses. An additional patient with pancreatic cancer and ATM LOF had a late response, just after the data cutoff after 54 weeks of treatment. The CBR in the patients with ATM LOF was 44% and mPFS was 17 weeks. Sequencing data demonstrated biallelic gene LOF, an emerging biomarker for synthetic lethal therapies, could potentially be leveraged to further enrich for patients most likely to benefit from camonsertib. CBR in patients with biallelic LOF was significantly higher (47%) compared to the CBR in patients with non-biallelic tumors (15%). 

RP-6306, Our Novel, First-in-Class PKMYT1 Inhibitor Program
 Overview
Using our proprietary, CRISPR-based SNIPRx discovery platform, we identified PKMYT1 as a strong hit in a CCNE1-overexpression SL screen. PKMYT1 is a kinase that phosphorylates CDK1, thereby holding the cyclin B-CDK1 complex in an inactive state until the cell is ready to enter mitosis. RP-6306 is being developed as a highly potent and selective PKMYT1 inhibitor that preferentially kills tumor cells overexpressing CCNE1 and was shown to inhibit the growth of a broad range of CCNE1-amplified tumors in xenograft/PDX preclinical models, both as a single agent and in combination therapy settings. RP-6306 has a favorable preclinical PK profile as well as low potential for drug-drug interactions. Application of our STEP2 genome-wide chemical screen has identified other gene alterations beyond CCNE1 amplification that are uniquely targetable by RP-6306, including tumors that have loss of FBXW7 function, a cell-cycle regulator that has been implicated as a key genetic driver in a broad range of cancers, and represent further areas of unmet medical need. We initiated patient recruitment in our open-label Phase 1 MYTHIC trial, as a monotherapy, for this program in April 2021. Our Phase 1 trial is enrolling patients suffering from recurrent tumors characterized by CCNE1 amplification and other genomic alterations which our STEP2 preclinical studies predicted to be sensitive to RP-6306. We are evaluating more than one schedule, if necessary, at which the capsules are given in this dose escalation trial. The primary objective is to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for RP-6306 for further studies as monotherapy and assess preliminary safety, tolerability, PK, and PD in patients. In December 2021, we enrolled the first patient in our open-label Phase 1 MAGNETIC trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP-6306 in combination with gemcitabine. In January 2022, we initiated patient recruitment in our open-label Phase 1 MINOTAUR trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP-6306 in combination with FOLFIRI. In May 2022, we initiated patient recruitment in a new arm of the Phase 1 MYTHIC clinical trial, which is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP-6306 in combination with camonsertib in patients with advanced solid tumors. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we received fast track designation for RP-6306 in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of adult patients with CCNE1 amplified, or FBXW7 or PPP2R1A mutated platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Based on promising preclinical data released at the 34th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium in October 2022, we are working with clinical investigators to initiate clinical testing, as part of an investigator-sponsored trial (IST), of a fourth new RP-6306 combination with carboplatin, with first patient dosing expected in the first half of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement with CCTG for a planned, basket Phase 2 IST to evaluate RP-6306 in patients with selected, advanced cancers receiving standard agents. We have planned a sub-study under this trial, which will allow us to evaluate RP-6306 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with CD4/6i-resistant ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We plan to provide an initial Phase 1 clinical data readout for RP-6306 in the first half of 2023 for monotherapy, and anticipate providing an update on some of the combination studies in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Mechanism of Action
 PKMYT1, the gene targeted by RP-6306 has not previously been published as a SL gene pair with CCNE1 amplification, and we are not aware of any advanced drug discovery efforts against this target. In preclinical studies, we observed that the deletion of this gene was well tolerated in wild-type cells, but it caused lethality in isogenic cancer cells that overexpressed CCNE1.
High levels of CCNE1 protein, an activating subunit of cyclin dependent kinase 2, or CDK2, are often observed in patients across multiple tumor types. Deregulation of cell cycle control is thought to be a prerequisite for tumor development, and several studies have demonstrated accelerated entry of cells into the S phase, or DNA synthesis phase, of the cell cycle, due to constitutive, or “always-on,” expression of CCNE1. Such an accelerated entry of cells into the S phase is a common sign of unregulated, cancerous growth. CCNE1 amplification can induce chromosome instability, another sign of cancer, by contributing to inappropriate initiation of DNA replication. Several studies have demonstrated that CCNE1 amplification or constitutive expression is associated with disease progression in various malignancies as well as poor clinical prognosis in patients across multiple cancers, including ovarian, breast, bladder, and colorectal cancer. For example, clinical data from patients with ovarian cancer indicate that those with CCNE1-amplified tumors have significantly shorter overall survival than those with tumors without CCNE1 amplification, as shown below.
24


CCNE1 Amplification is Associated with Significantly Shorter Overall Survival
in Patients with Ovarian Cancer


CCNE1 amplification is found in 4% of tumors in the pan-cancer TCGA studies. Over 40% of uterine carcinosarcoma cancers and 10% to 20% of ovarian and stomach cancers harbor CCNE1 amplification. Together, these cancers lead to over 40,000 deaths each year in the United States. Additional cancer types also harbor CCNE1 amplification at a lower frequency, including up to 3% to 8% of esophagus, bladder, lung, and pancreatic cancers, as shown below.
Top 10 Tumor Types with Highest Frequency of CCNE1 Amplification


Our Solution, RP-6306
We identified PKMYT1 as a critical SL target for patients with CCNE1 amplification through our SNIPRx screening campaign and selected PKMYT1 as a target for our lead product candidate, RP-6306, based on:
i.the target validation for PKMYT1;
 ii.our ability to design potent and selective PKMYT1 inhibitors; and 
 iii.the results of our STEP2 screens, which identified at least two additional genomic alterations beyond CCNE1 amplification to be SL with PKMYT1 inhibitor facilitating the expansion of the addressable patient populations.
 25


We designed RP-6306 as an oral small molecule PKMYT1 inhibitor with significant potency and an encouraging selectivity profile as a first in class compound. RP-6306 has demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in multiple preclinical models, including rodent and canine, and a distribution, metabolism and excretion profile that suggests a low potential for drug-drug interactions in the clinic. The clinical trial of RP-6306 in patients with recurrent cancers is ongoing.
 Our STEP2 screens have generated proprietary patient selection insights that we believe provide the rationale to expand the potential patient populations addressable by RP-6306 beyond patients with tumors carrying CCNE1 amplification. We have specifically identified FBXW7 and PPP2R1A genomic alterations, in addition to CCNE1 amplification, that confer sensitivity to RP-6306. This set of genes offers extended patient populations such as about 13% of colorectal cancer and other high unmet need tumors as presented in the graph below.
 Top 10 tumor types with highest prevalence of CCNE1 amplification and FBXW7 mutations deficiency
 
The proposed alterations specific to RP-6306 tumors are easily identifiable in commercially available Next Generation Sequencing cancer panels or CLIA-validated panels used in large academic centers. For our Phase 1/2 clinical trial, we identified and partnered with multiple large, leading clinical centers globally where tumor sequencing is a component of standard of care. These centers’ panels are validated and sufficiently large to accommodate screening for alterations in FBXW7 and CCNE1 or our other STEP2-identified genes. By working in collaboration with our clinical partners to access their existing patient databases, we are able to efficiently identify patients who may be eligible for our clinical trial.
Based on the prevalence of RP-6306 relevant genomic alterations across various solid tumors, as shown in the graph above, we believe that RP-6306 has the potential to benefit a significant number of patients representing a large unmet medical need.
Preclinical data: Monotherapy
 We observed that RP-6306 has a favorable tolerability and PK profile preclinically which we believe supported advancement of the product candidate into clinical trials. We tested RP-6306 as a single agent in two preclinical cell line derived models of cancer selected to represent our target patient populations by having amplification of CCNE1. The HCC1569 breast cancer model and the OVCAR3 ovarian cancer model with CCNE1 copy numbers of 34-fold and 14-fold above ploidy, respectively. In the HCC1569 breast cancer xenograft model, RP-6306 was orally administered at doses of 2.5, 7.5 or 20 mg/kg twice daily (BID) for 28 days. RP-6306 produced a dose-dependent reduction in tumor growth reaching a statistically significant difference at all doses and a maximum effect of 77%. In the 20 mg/kg group, mice exhibited body weight loss of 3.2% at the end of study. In the OVCAR3 ovarian cancer xenograft model, RP-6306 was orally administered at doses of 2.5, 7.5 or 20 mg/kg twice daily (BID) for 28 days. RP-6306 produced a dose-dependent reduction in tumor growth reaching a statistically significant difference at all doses and a maximum effect of 82%. In the 20 mg/kg group, mice exhibited body weight loss of 6.9% at the end of study.
  In preclinical studies, RP-6306 demonstrated in vivo anti-tumor activity in two cell line derived xenograft models with CCNE1 amplification. In both models, we observed statistically significant dose-dependent tumor growth suppression across a range of doses from 2.5 to 20 mg/kg BID (twice-daily administration for RP-6306).

RP-6306 Demonstrates Tumor Growth Suppression in CCNE1-Amplified Cell Line Derived Xenograft Models
    Preclinical Data: Combination Therapies with RP-6306
 Chemotherapeutic drugs have diverse mechanisms of action, and some target DNA replication and induce DNA replication stress. During the S-phase of the cell cycle, DNA is replicated to create DNA for two daughter cells following cell division. S-phase disrupting drugs increase dependence on cell cycle checkpoints. Combining this S-phase vulnerability with RP-6306, which forces S-phase replicating cells into premature mitosis, is expected to be catastrophic to tumor cells.
 Gemcitabine prolongs the S-phase by both interfering with DNA polymerase and disrupting the supply of nucleotides. Clinically, gemcitabine has been used as a single agent or in combination with carboplatin, cisplatin, or paclitaxel for the treatment of pancreatic, ovarian, breast, bladder, testicular, and non-small cell lung cancer. Recent studies have tested gemcitabine in combination with DNA damage repair inhibitors (PARP and ATR inhibitors), as well as cell cycle inhibitors (WEE1, CDK4/6, and Chk1 inhibitors) across a spectrum of relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumors. Attempts to combine gemcitabine with inhibitors of these checkpoints have struggled with toxicity, impacting proliferating tumor and normal tissue with similar effect. In a setting of CCNE1, FBXW7, PPP2R1A, and potentially other RP-6306 STEP2 genetic alterations, however, it is expected that gemcitabine will exacerbate the replication stress environment where PKMYT1 is essential for survival and provide synthetic lethal synergy with enhanced benefit and therapeutic index.
 The rationale behind combining RP-6306 and FOLFIRI in CCNE1-amplified or FBXW7-mutated tumors is similar to that of gemcitabine. The two main agents found in FOLFIRI are irinotecan (metabolized in tissues to SN-38) and fluorouracil, both of which act specifically in S-phase. SN-38 acts on the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents re-ligation of the DNA strand, resulting in double-strand DNA breaks and cell death. Fluorouracil acts as a thymidylate synthase inhibitor which blocks synthesis of the pyrimidine thymidine, required for DNA replication. Combining this chemotherapy-induced S-phase vulnerability with RP-6306, which forces S-phase replicating cells into premature mitosis, is expected to be catastrophic to tumor cells.
 

The combination of RP-6306 and gemcitabine was evaluated in CCNE1 amplified model of ovarian cancer (OVCAR3) on a continuous BID dosing of RP-6306 at 10mg/kg and gemcitabine at 20mg/kg once weekly. The combination resulted in complete tumor regression that was significantly better than either agent alone with minimal impact on body weight loss (6.8% for the combination at the end of dosing).

    The combination of RP-6306 and irinotecan was evaluated in CCNE1-amplified model of breast cancer (HCC1569) on a continuous BID dosing of RP-6306 at 5 mg/kg and irinotecan at 30 mg/kg three times a week. The combination resulted in tumor regression that was significantly better than either agent alone with minimal impact on weight loss (1.5% for the combination at the end of dosing).

    The combination of low dose RP-6306 and camonsertib was evaluated in a pair of isogenic models of colorectal cancer having normal FBXW7 or FBXW7 loss-of-function. RP-6306 was administered at 5mg/kg BID and camonsertib was administered at 10mg/kg QD three times a week. Neither compound alone nor the combination substantially impacted tumor growth of FBXW7-normal tumors. In contrast, a low dose of RP-6306 in combination

with camonsertib resulted in profound regression of FBXW7 loss-of-function tumors with 3 of 8 mice tumor free on day 22. The combination was well tolerated with a < 8% maximal mean body weight loss.

Preclinical Validation of STEP2 Screens
 To identify additional genetic lesions which might have a synthetic lethal relationship with PKMYT1, several STEP2 screens were conducted. These genome wide CRISPR screens were conducted with sub-cytotoxic concentrations of PKMYT1 inhibitor and identified FBXW7 and several additional genetic alterations. FBXW7 is known to be mutated in colorectal cancers and NSCLC, among others. FBXW7 is an E3-ubiquitin ligase that targets Cyclin E1 (as well as other oncogenes) for degradation by the proteosome and has been shown to be a tumor suppressor gene. Therefore, there exists a strong mechanistic rationale for synthetic lethality with PKMYT1, and they represent a significant opportunity to expand the clinical utility of RP-6306.
  In preclinical studies, RP-6306 demonstrated in vivo anti-tumor activity in two patient derived xenograft models with FBXW7 inactivating mutations. In both models, we observed statistically significant tumor growth suppression with twice daily administration for RP-6306.

Design of Trials
 In April 2021, we initiated our open-label Phase 1 MYTHIC clinical trial of RP-6306 as a monotherapy. The trial is designed to evaluate the oral administration of RP-6306 in patients with advanced recurrent tumors of different histologies in tumors with detected CCNE1 amplification, deleterious alterations in FBXW7, PPP2R1A and other STEP2 genes, for which recent in-vitro studies suggested a higher confidence of success.
In the ongoing monotherapy dose escalation phase of our MYTHIC trial, we are evaluating the dosing regimen and safety of RP-6306. The MYTHIC trial is enrolling patients suffering from recurrent tumors characterized by CCNE1 amplification and other genomic alterations, which our STEP2 preclinical studies predicted to be sensitive to RP-6306. We are evaluating more than one schedule at which the capsules are given, as necessary, in this dose escalation trial. The primary objective is to establish dose and schedule for RP-6306 for further studies as monotherapy and assess preliminary safety and tolerability in patients. The clinical plan beyond the dose escalation and initial explorations of dose and safety is presented below. In parallel with the monotherapy dose escalation phase, two other trials were initiated in February 2022 and December 2021, which we refer to as the MINOTAUR and MAGNETIC trials, to evaluate RP-6306 in combination with FOLFIRI and gemcitabine, respectively. In May 2022, we initiated patient recruitment in a new arm of the Phase 1 MYTHIC clinical trial, which is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP-6306 in combination with camonsertib in patients with advanced solid tumors. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we received fast track designation for RP-6306 in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of adult patients with CCNE1 amplified, or FBXW7 or PPP2R1A mutated platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Based on promising preclinical data released at the 34th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium in October 2022, we are working with clinical investigators to initiate clinical testing, as part of an investigator-sponsored trial (IST), of a fourth new RP-6306 combination with carboplatin, with first patient dosing expected in the first half of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement with CCTG for a planned, basket Phase 2 IST to evaluate RP-6306 in patients with selected, advanced cancers receiving standard agents. We plan to initiate a sub-study, which will allow us to evaluate RP-6306 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with CD4/6i-resistant ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We plan to provide an initial Phase 1 clinical data readout for RP-6306 in the first half of 2023 for monotherapy, and anticipate providing an update on some of the combination studies in the fourth quarter of 2023.
 The designs of our Phase 1 clinical trial and Phase 2 IST are summarized in the diagram below.
    Our Polymerase Theta (Polθ) Preclinical Program
We are developing a small molecule inhibitor of Polθ, a SL target associated with BRCA mutations as well as other genomic alterations, in collaboration with Ono. This program was initially added to our portfolio through a

collaboration with our co-founder, Dr. Agnel Sfeir, now at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who initially published her observations on the SL between BRCA and Polθ in Nature in 2016.
Polymerase theta enzyme, or POLQ, is a DNA polymerase enzyme that participates in the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA. Mutations in genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the frequency of these breaks, resulting in SL with Polθ. Preclinical studies have shown that inactivation of Polθ both on its own and in combination with PARP inhibitors reduces survival in BRCA-mutated cells, but not in BRCA wild-type cells. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are routinely identified in multiple genetic profiling tests and observed in approximately 1% to 7% of patients with breast and ovarian cancer. However, the frequency of mutations in one of these BRCA genes increases in women with a family history of disease and in certain subpopulations. For example, up to 37% of patients with breast cancer with low estrogen and progesterone receptor expression have BRCA mutations.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have also been shown in clinical trials to be SL with PARP inhibitors in multiple tumors, such as breast and ovarian cancer. While PARP inhibitors have proven effective in BRCA-mutant tumors, no statistically significant survival benefit has been reported in breast or pancreatic cancer to date, highlighting the potential for other SL targets, such as Polθ, to demonstrate meaningful efficacy as a monotherapy or in combination with PARP inhibitors. In 2022, we selected a proposed inhibitor, which we designated as RP-2119, and initiated IND-enabling studies. In February 2023, based on our review of ongoing preclinical studies, we elected to prioritize other Polθ inhibiting compounds in our preclinical development portfolio, which we believe have a higher probability for clinical impact relative to RP-2119. We are now guiding toward clinical entry for a Polθ inhibitor in 2024.
 Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions, and improvements that we believe are important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms, and our product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business.
As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio relating to our product candidates included seven pending U.S. provisional patent applications, consisting of; two applications covering uses of ATR inhibitors; two applications covering CCNE1-SL inhibitors and their use; one application covering the manufacture of RP-6306; and two applications covering PolQ inhibitors and their use. In addition, our patent portfolio included six pending international applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty of 1970, or the PCT, three covering camonsertib and/or its uses and three covering RP-6306 and its uses. Our portfolio also included five pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, three covering camonsertib and its use and two covering RP-6306 derivatives.

As of December 31, 2022, three of our four PCT applications have composition of matter or method of treatment and use claims covering camonsertib. Any application, if issued, claiming priority to any of these PCT applications is expected to expire in 2040, not including any patent term adjustment. One of our four solely owned PCT applications has composition of matter claims covering RP-6306. Any application, if issued, claiming priority to this PCT application is expected to expire in 2041, not including any patent term adjustment. Any patent issuing in our solely owned, pending U.S. non-provisional patent application having composition of matter and method of treatment and use claims covering camonsertib and its use is expected to expire in 2039, not including any patent term adjustment. Any patent issuing in our solely owned, pending U.S. non-provisional patent application having method of treatment and use claims covering certain uses of camonsertib is expected to expire in 2040, not including any patent term adjustment. Any U.S. patent, if issued, claiming priority to any one of the U.S. provisional patent applications covering uses of camonsertib is expected to expire in 2043. Any U.S. patent, if issued, claiming priority to any one of the U.S. provisional patent applications covering CCNE1-SL inhibitors and their use, is expected to expire in 2042. Any U.S. patent, if issued, claiming priority to either of the U.S. provisional patent applications covering CCNE1-SL inhibitors, including RP-6306 and its use, is expected to expire in 2043. Any U.S. patent, if issued, claiming priority to the U.S. provisional patent applications covering uses of CCNE1-SL inhibitors, including RP-6306, is expected to expire in 2043. Any U.S. patent, if issued, claiming priority to the U.S. provisional patent applications covering PolQ inhibitors and their use, is expected to expire in 2043.


 As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio also included two co-owned, pending international applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty of 1970, or the PCT. The PCT applications cover uses of CCNE1-SL inhibitors, including RP-6306. Any U.S. patent, if issued, claiming priority to the PCT applications is expected to expire in 2041 or 2042, respectively.
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
The PCT is an international patent law treaty that provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. Thus, a single PCT application can be converted into a patent application in any of the PCT-contracting states, and is considered a simple, cost-effective means for seeking patent protection in numerous regions or countries. This nationalization (converting into an application in any of the contracting states) typically occurs 18 months after the PCT application filing date. An applicant must undertake prosecution within the allotted time in each of the contracting states or on a regional basis if it determines to undertake patent issuance in protection in such country or territory. Pursuant to its PCT application, the Company expects to pursue patent protection in the United States.
In addition, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our product candidates or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future product candidates may have an adverse impact on us.

Collaborations and License Agreements
Collaboration and Worldwide License Agreement with Roche
In June 2022, we announced a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (collectively, Roche), or the Roche Agreement for the development and commercialization of camonsertib and specified other ATR inhibitors for the treatment of tumors with specific synthetic-lethal genomic alterations. Under the Roche Agreement, Roche assumes all subsequent development of camonsertib with the potential to expand development into additional tumor indications and multiple combination studies.

Under the terms of the Roche Agreement, we received a $125 million upfront payment in July 2022, and are eligible to receive up to $1.172 billion in potential clinical, regulatory, commercial and sales milestones, including up to $55 million in potential near-term payments, and royalties on global net sales ranging from high-single-digits to high-teens. We received $5.6 million in October 2022 for the transfer of clinical trial material on hand to Roche, as agreed to pursuant to the Roche Agreement. In December 2022 we received an additional payment of $4.0 million negotiated with Roche for revisions to the clinical development plan under the Roche Agreement as agreed to by the parties on July 13, 2022. The Roche Agreement also provides our company with the ability to opt-in to a 50/50 U.S. co-development and profit share arrangement, including participation in U.S. co-promotion if U.S. regulatory approval is received, that is exercisable prior to the commencement of the first pivotal clinical trial of camonsertib. If we choose to exercise the co-development and profit share option, we will continue to be eligible to receive certain clinical, regulatory, commercial and sales milestone payments, in addition to full ex-U.S. royalties. Royalties are payable by Roche on a product by product and country by country basis until the later of 12 years following the first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country or the expiration of certain exclusivity rights.
 We have agreed to complete the specified ongoing clinical trials, TRESR and ATTACC, at our expense. We have also retained the right to conduct specified clinical trials of camonsertib in combination with our PKMYT1 compound, RP-6306.
 The Roche Agreement was subsequently amended in October 2022 to extend the timeline to negotiate in good faith the parties’ rights and obligations with respect to certain clinical trials and to clarify indications included in the development plan that are subject to milestones.
 Collaboration and License Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
In May 2020, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the BMS Agreement, with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or Bristol Myers Squibb, pursuant to which we and Bristol Myers Squibb have agreed to collaborate in the research and development of potential new product candidates for the treatment of cancer.
We are providing Bristol Myers Squibb access to a selected number of our existing early SNIPRx screening campaigns and novel campaigns. We are responsible for carrying out early-stage research activities directed to identifying and validating potential targets for licensing by Bristol Myers Squibb, in accordance with a mutually agreed upon research plan. The collaboration consists of programs directed to both druggable targets and to targets commonly considered undruggable by traditional small molecule approaches. In the event that Bristol Myers Squibb elects to obtain an exclusive license on for the subsequent development, manufacture and commercialization of a program, Bristol Myers Squibb will then be solely responsible for all such worldwide activities. The research collaboration will be overseen by a joint steering committee through completion of all research activities.
 The BMS Agreement has been subsequently amended in July, September and November 2020 to expand our collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb. We amended the BMS Agreement to, among other things: (i) include additional campaigns to the list of Existing Repare Campaigns (as such term is defined in the BMS Agreement) from which Bristol Myers Squibb may select campaigns under the BMS agreement, and (ii) enable unblinding of a Bristol Myers Squibb alliance manager in order to streamline the collaboration and selection process.
Under the terms of the BMS Agreement, Bristol Myers Squibb paid us an initial upfront fee payment of $50.0 million. In connection with entering into the BMS Agreement, we also entered into a warrant agreement with an affiliate of Bristol Myers Squibb pursuant to which we issued a warrant for total proceeds of $15.0 million, which was automatically exercised into 750,000 common shares upon closing of our IPO at which time the warrants were cancelled.
For each of the targets in the collaboration, we are entitled to receive, on a program-by-program basis, option exercise fees ranging in the low six figures depending on the nature of the applicable program. Bristol Myers Squibb has the right to retain rights to certain back-up programs in exchange for a one-time payment in the low eight figures per program. Additionally, we are entitled to receive additional fees ranging in the low to mid seven figures upon the selection of certain programs beyond a specified limit.

In October 2021, we received notification from Bristol Myers Squibb of their option exercise for two druggable targets directed at a single synthetic lethal lesion, pursuant to the terms of the BMS Agreement.
 Under the BMS Agreement, we are entitled to receive up to $3.0 billion in total milestones across all potential programs. Such milestones consist of $301.0 million in total milestones per program, including $176.0 million in the aggregate for certain specified research, development, and regulatory milestones and $125.0 million in the aggregate for certain specified commercial milestones. We are also entitled to a tiered percentage royalty on annual net sales ranging from high-single digits to low-double digits, subject to certain specified reductions. Royalties are payable by Bristol Myers Squibb on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last valid claim covering the licensed product in such country, expiration of all applicable regulatory exclusivities in such country for such licensed product and the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country.
 On a program-by-program basis, prior to the earlier of such program ceasing to be included under the BMS Agreement and expiration of the last to expire royalty term for such program, we, alone and with third parties, are prohibited from researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing products that are directed to the applicable target for such program.
 We also have provided Bristol Myers Squibb with certain, limited rights to first negotiate with us if we determine to divest, license, or collaborate with others regarding certain existing programs, including in the event that we received an unsolicited offer to do so. The right to first negotiation expressly excludes any potential Change of Control transaction (as such term is contractually defined in the BMS Agreement).
The BMS Agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis on expiration of the applicable royalty term and in its entirety upon expiration of the last royalty term. Either party may terminate the BMS Agreement earlier upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party, or the insolvency of the other party. Additionally, Bristol Myers Squibb may terminate the BMS Agreement for any or no reason on a program-by-program basis upon specified written notice.
 Research Services, License and Collaboration Agreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co.
All payments by Ono to us are presented in U.S. dollars. Future payments as disclosed in this summary have been converted to U.S. dollars at the December 31, 2022 exchange rate of $1.00 = [131.12] Japanese yen.
In January 2019, we entered into a research services, license and collaboration agreement, or the Ono Agreement, with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Ono, pursuant to which we and Ono have agreed to collaborate in the research of potential product candidates targeting Polθ and the development of our small molecule Polθ inhibitor program. We are primarily responsible for carrying out research activities to identify a product candidate for the program, to be licensed to Ono, in accordance with a mutually agreed upon research plan until the first submission of an IND in the United States or Japan. In the event that Ono elects to collaborate on the subsequent development and commercialization of a proposed product candidate, Ono will then be responsible for such activities in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and certain other Southeast Asian countries, and we will be responsible for such activities in the rest of the world. The collaboration will be overseen by a joint research committee through development candidate selection and a joint steering committee thereafter. Except as set forth below, each party will bear its own expenses in connection with research, development, and commercialization activities under the Ono Agreement.
In October 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Ono Agreement whereby the Research Term, as defined in the Ono Agreement, was extended by one year at no additional cost to us. In January 2023, we and Ono entered into a second amendment to the Ono Agreement whereby the Research Term was extended until July 31, 2023.
 Under the terms of the Ono Agreement, Ono paid us an initial upfront fee payment of ¥110 million (approximately $1.0 million). Additionally, in connection with the research activities to be conducted by us pursuant to the Ono Agreement, Ono paid us an initial upfront research service payment of ¥790 million (approximately $7.1 million) and has agreed to make research service payments up to an aggregate of ¥750 million (approximately $5.7 million) upon (i) certain specified research triggers and (ii) the election by Ono to collaborate on the development and

commercialization of a proposed product candidate. In October 2021 and December 2022, the Company achieved specified research triggers amounting to ¥100 million ($0.9 million) and ¥200 million ($1.5 million), respectively, as research service payments provided for in the Ono Agreement. The ¥200 million ($1.5 million) is included in the collaboration revenue receivable at December 31, 2022 and was subsequently received in January 2023. Upon election by Ono to collaborate on a proposed product candidate, Ono shall be responsible for a specified percentage of research and development costs for the IND-enabling studies of the selected product candidate. As of December 31, 2022 there was $10.5 million classified as current deferred revenue related to the Ono Agreement.
Under the Ono Agreement, we are also entitled to receive up to ¥5.11 billion (approximately $39.0 million) in the aggregate for certain specified development and regulatory milestones, ¥12.1 billion (approximately $92.3 million) in the aggregate for certain specified commercial milestones and a tiered percentage royalty on annual net sales in Ono’s territory ranging from high-single digits to low teens, subject to certain specified reductions. Royalties are payable by Ono on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last valid claim covering the licensed product in such country and the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country.
During the term of the Ono Agreement, we, alone and with third parties, are prohibited from researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing products that inhibit or modulate Polθ as a mechanism of action in Ono’s territory (as such term is defined in the Ono Agreement). During the term of the Ono Agreement, Ono, alone and with third parties, is prohibited from researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing products, other than licensed products, that inhibit or modulate Polθ as a mechanism of action in Ono’s territory.
The collaboration and research obligations of the Ono Agreement may be terminated upon the mutual written consent of both parties on or before the two-year anniversary of the Ono Agreement. The Ono Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations. Either party may terminate the Ono Agreement earlier upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party, the insolvency of the other party, or the initiation of an action challenging the validity or enforceability of a party’s patents. Additionally, Ono may terminate the Ono Agreement for any or no reason on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon specified written notice, as well as on a product-by-product basis for safety or efficacy reasons upon abbreviated written notice. Moreover, in the event that we are acquired by a third party and after any such acquisition the acquirer initiates a competing program in Ono’s territory, Ono will have the right to treat such initiation as a material breach.
License Agreement with New York University
In December 2016, we entered into a license agreement with New York University pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing, exclusive license under certain current and/or future patents and know-how of New York University to research, develop and commercialize products that are covered by such licensed patents or otherwise modulate Polθ. Upon initial entry into the license agreement, we issued New York University 60,211 common shares in December 2016 as consideration for the license.
In July 2018, we subsequently amended and restated our license agreement with NYU, which we refer to, as amended and restated, as the NYU Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the NYU Agreement, we are obligated to use reasonable diligence in connection with the research, development, and commercialization of the licensed products (as such term is defined in the NYU Agreement), including specified minimum annual spends on research and development.
Under the terms of the NYU Agreement, we are obligated to pay New York University annual license maintenance fees in the low five figures that are creditable against any milestone payments payable in such year. Additionally, in connection with development, regulatory and commercial activities, we have agreed to make milestone payments of (i) $2.6 million in the aggregate for a product covered by a licensed patent that achieves specified development and sales milestones for the first indication, (ii) $1.3 million in the aggregate for a product covered by a licensed patent that achieves specified development and sales milestones for a second indication, (iii) $575,000 in the aggregate for a product covered by a licensed patent that achieves specified development and sales milestones for each of a third and fourth indication, (iv) $1.3 million in the aggregate for a product that is not covered by a licensed patent that achieves specified development and sales milestones for the first indication, (v) $650,000 in the aggregate for a product that is not covered by a licensed patent that achieves specified development and sales

milestones for a second indication, (vi) $287,500 in the aggregate for a product that is not covered by a licensed patent that achieves specified development and sales milestones for each of a third and fourth indication. We have the right to reduce these milestone payments by a specified amount of any milestones payable to a third party for a license required for the commercialization of a product candidate.
We are also obligated to pay New York University a low single digit royalty on net sales of any product covered by a licensed patent and a lower single digit royalty on net sales of any product that is not covered by a licensed patent, in each case subject to reduction by a specified amount of any royalties payable to a third party for a license to unblocking intellectual property. Moreover, we are obligated to pay New York University a percentage of any non-royalty consideration received by us from a sublicensee ranging in the low double digits.
Ono is considered a sublicensee under the terms of the NYU Agreement. Accordingly, we have paid New York University a specified percentage of the approximately $1.0 million initial upfront fee payment we received from Ono and we will be required to pay New York University a percentage between the high teens and low twenties of any future payments received under the Ono Agreement from Ono for development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as low single digit royalties on annual net sales in Ono’s territory.
Payments in respect of net sales or sublicense in a country shall remain in force on a product-by-product, country-by-country basis, with respect to (i) products that are not covered by a licensed patent, for ten years from the date of first commercial sale in such country and (ii) products that are covered by a licensed patent, until the expiration date of the last to expire of the licensed patents covering such product or its manufacture or use in the applicable country.
The NYU Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations. Either party may terminate the NYU Agreement earlier upon an uncured material breach of NYU Agreement by the other party or the insolvency of the other party.
Sales and Marketing
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We have established a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, Repare Therapeutics USA Inc., a Delaware corporation with operations in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to support our clinical development program and our potential commercialization efforts in the United States.
Manufacturing
We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for future commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize.
We require all of our CMOs to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the necessary technical, quality, and regulatory oversight over our CMOs. Currently, we have manufacturing and supply agreements with our CMOs for the manufacture of RP-6306 and our preclinical candidates, including the synthesis of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, as well as drug product. Roche will manufacture and supply camonsertib for ongoing and future trials, in compliance with cGMP requirements.
 All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in synthetic processes from available starting materials. The chemistry underlying our product candidates appears amenable to scale up and does not currently require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
We plan to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for any future trials and commercialization of RP-6306, and any future product candidates, if approved, and will rely on Roche to manufacture and supply camonsertib for any future trials and commercialization, if approved. We anticipate that Roche and these CMOs will have capacity

to support commercial scale production, but we do not have any formal agreements in place at this time given our early stages of development. If needed, we believe we can identify and establish additional CMOs to provide API and finished drug product without significant disruption to our business or clinical development timelines.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the rapid evolution of technologies and understanding of disease etiology, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We believe that our approach, strategy, scientific capabilities, know-how and experience provide us with competitive advantages. However, we expect substantial competition from multiple sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and existing or emerging biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions worldwide. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaborations, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license, or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
We face competition from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue the development of precision oncology therapies for patients with genetically-defined cancers. Several biopharmaceutical companies, including Loxo Oncology, Inc. (acquired by Eli Lilly and Company), Blueprint Medicines Corporation, SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc., Black Diamond Therapeutics, Inc., Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tango Therapeutics, Inc., Zentalis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Turning Point Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb), and Exelixis, Inc. are developing precision oncology medicines. In addition, we may face competition from companies developing product candidates that are based on SL, including AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Bayer, Merck Serono, Schrodinger, Inc., Exelixis, Inc., Artios Pharma Ltd., IDEAYA Biosciences, Inc, Impact Therapeutics, Aprea Therapeutics, Acrivon Therapeutics, Treadwell Therapeutics, Debiopharm Group, Varsity Pharma, Breakpoint Therapeutics, and Rhizen Pharmaceuticals AG.
Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the oncology market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation, and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, biologic therapy, such as monoclonal and bispecific antibodies, immunotherapy, cell-based therapy and targeted therapy, or a combination of any such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drugs and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market may pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new oncology therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
With respect to our initial product candidate, camonsertib (now partnered with Roche), several companies are developing ATR inhibitors with multiple monotherapy and/or combination trials ongoing, including AstraZeneca (AZD6738), Bayer (BAY1895344), Merck Serono (M4344, M6620, M1774) and most recently, Artios Pharma (ATR0380), Aprea Therapeutics/Atrin Pharmaceuticals (ATRN-119), and Impact Therapeutics (IMP9064). The intensity of trials with ATR inhibitors as monotherapy and in combination with immune-oncology compounds, chemotherapy and radiation, as well as other DDR inhibitors significantly increased over the last several months.
 With respect to our PKMYT1 inhibitor product candidate, RP-6306, Exelixis, Inc. and Acrivon Therapeutics have disclosed PKMYT1 inhibitor programs in early preclinical development.

For our preclinical Polθ inhibitor program, Artios Pharma (ART-4215), IDEAYA Biosciences (in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline plc), Varsity Pharma, Breakpoint Therapeutics, and Rhizen Pharmaceuticals AG have Polθ programs in various stages of clinical and preclinical development.
 We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to administer, are less expensive or with a more favorable label than our product candidates. Our competitors also may compete for available patient pool, slowing our accrual in trials, obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture, and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, packaging, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, distribution, advertising, and promotion of our products.
U.S. Government Regulation of Drug Products
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve a pending New Drug Application, or NDA, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•nonclinical laboratory and animal tests that must be conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices, or GLPs; 
 •submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each clinical site or centrally before each trial may be initiated; 
 •adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for its intended use, performed in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs; 
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA and payment of user fees; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 •pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with cGMP and good clinical practices, or GCPs; 
 •satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; 


•FDA review and approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use; and 
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources.
Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, a sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other required information, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, as well as amendments to previously submitted clinical trials. Further, an independent IRB for each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, its informed consent form, and other communications to study subjects before the clinical trial commences at that site. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted, including any changes to the study plans.
Regulatory authorities, an IRB or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA’s or the IRB’s requirements, or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board, which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise the sponsor to halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
•Phase 1—Studies are initially conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy volunteers or subjects with the target disease or condition. If possible, Phase 1 clinical trials may also be used to gain an initial indication of product effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2—Controlled studies are conducted with groups of subjects with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expansive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3—These clinical trials are generally undertaken in larger subject populations to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded subject population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These clinical trials may be done at trial sites outside the United States as long as the global sites are also representative of the U.S. population and the conduct of the study at global sites comports with FDA regulations and guidance, such as compliance with GCPs. 


The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information.
Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, and the review and approval of the study by an IRB. Investigators must also provide information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make specified financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated and a statistical analysis plan. Information about some clinical trials, including a description of the trial and trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur.
The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse effects occur.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides additional opportunities for interaction with the FDA’s review team and may allow for rolling review of NDA components before the completed application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. The FDA may decide to rescind the fast track designation if it determines that the qualifying criteria no longer apply.
In addition, a sponsor can request breakthrough therapy designation for a drug if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.

Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for intensive guidance from the FDA on an efficient drug development program, organizational commitment to the development and review of the product including involvement of senior managers, and, like fast track products, are also eligible for rolling review of the NDA. Both fast track and breakthrough therapy products may be eligible for accelerated approval and/or priority review, if relevant criteria are met.
Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post approval studies and regularly update FDA on their progress, or confirm a clinical benefit during post marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated approval regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Once an NDA is submitted for a product intended to treat a serious condition, the FDA may assign a priority review designation if FDA determines that the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines. Under the current PDUFA performance goals, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the 60-day filing date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review from the date of submission.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on responding to requests for expanded access. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
NDA Submission and Review by the FDA
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical and preclinical testing, among other items, the results of product development, including chemistry, manufacture and controls, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA, along with proposed labeling, as part of an NDA. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. These user fees must be filed at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in some circumstances.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA must refer applications for drugs that contain active ingredients, including any ester or salt of the active ingredients, that have not previously been approved by the FDA to an advisory committee or provide in an action letter a summary of the reasons for not referring it to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer drugs which present difficult questions of safety, purity, or potency to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts who review, evaluate, and make a recommendation as to

whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and subcontracts, are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review, before it accepts the application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has set the review goal of 10 months from the 60-day filing date to complete its initial review of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity, or NME, and make a decision on the application. For priority review applications, the FDA has set the review goal of reviewing NME NDAs within six months of the 60-day filing date. Such deadlines are referred to as the PDUFA date. The PDUFA date is only a goal and the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. The review process and the PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding the submission during the review period that amends the original application.
Once the FDA’s review of the application is complete, the FDA will issue either a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, or approval letter. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing, or other information or analyses in order for the FDA to reconsider the application in the future. Even with the submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms. For example, the FDA may require a REMS as a condition of approval or following approval to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product, or impose additional post-marketing requirements, based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, FDA notification and FDA review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling or FDA notification may be required.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed or may include contraindications, warnings, or precautions in the product labeling, which has resulted in a boxed warning. A boxed warning is the strictest warning put in the labeling of prescription drugs or drug products by the FDA when there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with the drug. The FDA also may not approve the inclusion of all labeling claims sought by an applicant. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.

U.S. Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, promotion, drug shortage reporting, compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a conditional of approval such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS and surveillance, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, including adverse experiences.
After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fee requirements for approved products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and to list their drug products and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements, which impose procedural and documentation requirements.
Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented, or FDA notification. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and specifications and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in withdrawal of marketing approval, mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or other limitations, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program, among other consequences.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are consistent with the FDA approved labeling. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgement, may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. However, manufacturers and third parties acting on their behalf are prohibited from marketing or promoting drugs in a manner inconsistent with the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Failure to comply with any of the FDA’s requirements could result in significant adverse enforcement actions. These include a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment. It is also possible that failure to comply with the FDA’s requirements relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws, as well as state consumer protection laws. Any of these sanctions could result in adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences.
U.S. Marketing Exclusivity
The FDA provides periods of non-patent regulatory exclusivity, which provides the holder of an approved NDA limited protection from new competition in the marketplace for the innovation represented by its approved drug for a period of three or five years following the FDA’s approval of the NDA. Five years of exclusivity are available to new chemical entities, or NCEs. An NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt, including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds, or other noncovalent, or not

involving the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, derivatives, such as a complex (i.e., formed by the chemical interaction of two compounds), chelate (i.e., a chemical compound), or clathrate (i.e., a polymer framework that traps molecules), of the molecule, responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review or approve an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, however, may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed.
Regulation outside the United States
We will be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations concerning the development of our product candidates outside of the United States.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education and other activities are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and its various divisions, including Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws and regulations, including those described below.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, the referral of an individual for, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility, item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other hand. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and other healthcare criminal fraud statutes, so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have violated the statute. The ACA also provided that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is grounds for the government or a whistleblower to assert that a claim for payment of items or services resulting from such violation constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act, or FCA.
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the FCA, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the U.S. federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties. Government enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have investigated pharmaceutical companies

for or asserted liability under the FCA for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free products to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the products; providing consulting fees and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe products; engaging in promotion for “off-label” uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Additionally, the ACA amended the intent requirement of some of these criminal statutes under HIPAA so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation.
Additionally, the federal Open Payments program pursuant to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under Section 6002 of the ACA and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with specified exceptions) to report annually information related to specified payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually specified ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates and covered subcontractors. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and/or state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Ensuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will likely be costly. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations were found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from government funded

healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations. If the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Our ability to commercialize any products successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for the procedures utilizing our product candidates, performed by health care providers, once approved, will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which procedures, and the products utilized in such procedures, they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Assuming coverage is obtained for procedures utilizing a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who undergo procedures for the treatment of their conditions, and their treating physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the procedures which utilize our products. Treating physicians are unlikely to use and order our products unless coverage is provided and the reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of the procedures which utilize our products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement for procedures which utilize new products is critical to the acceptance of such new products. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available.
Government authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of cost containment, such as including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of less expensive products and procedures. Government and other third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for health care products and procedures, examining the cost effectiveness of procedures, and the products used in such procedures, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and limiting or attempting to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement. Further, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement exists among third-party payors in the United States, which causes significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products, and the procedures which may utilize such newly approved products. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor and health care provider to health care provider. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that requires the provision of scientific and clinical support for the use of new products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a product, or the procedures which utilize such product, will be paid for in all cases or at a rate which the health care providers who purchase those products will find cost effective. Additionally, we expect pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes.
We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize, or the procedures which utilize such product, and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.
Healthcare Reform Measures
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system. Among policy-makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, the pharmaceutical industry in the United States has been affected by the passage of ACA, which, among other things: imposed new fees on entities that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drugs; expanded pharmaceutical manufacturer obligations to provide discounts and rebates to certain government programs; implemented a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products; expanded health care fraud and abuse laws; revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; imposed an additional rebate similar to an inflation penalty on new formulations of drugs; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; expanded the 340B program which caps the price at which manufacturers can sell covered outpatient pharmaceuticals to specified hospitals, clinics and community health centers; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and additional healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments will remain in effect through 2031, unless additional U.S. Congressional action is taken. These Medicare sequester reductions will be suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, ended the use of the statutory formula for clinician payment and established a quality payment incentive program, also referred to as the Quality Payment Program. This program provides clinicians with two ways to participate, including through the Advanced Alternative Payment Models, or APMs, and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS. In November 2019, CMS issued a final rule finalizing the changes to the Quality Payment Program. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the Quality Payment Program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. Any

reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
In addition, there has been particular and increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices in recent years, particularly with respect to drugs that have been subject to relatively large price increases over relatively short time periods. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, Presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report within ninety (90) days on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. In addition, individual states in the United States have become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In the future, there will likely continue to be proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of products.
