ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Corporate Overview of NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation
 
We were originally incorporated as Original Source Entertainment, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 20, 2009. Prior to the closing of the Acquisition, as defined below, we completed a series of steps contemplated by a Plan of Conversion pursuant to which we, among other things, changed our name to NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation, increased our authorized number of shares of Common Stock from 45,000,000 to 100,000,000, increased our authorized number of shares of preferred stock from 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 and reincorporated in Delaware. On July 20, 2017, we acquired NeuroOne, Inc. (the “Acquisition”). Immediately following the closing of the Acquisition, the business of NeuroOne, Inc. became our sole focus. Unless otherwise stated or unless the context otherwise requires, the description of our business set forth below is provided on a combined basis, taking into account our wholly-owned subsidiary, NeuroOne, Inc.
 
Corporate Overview and History of NeuroOne, Inc.
 
NeuroOne, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 7, 2016. Its predecessor entity, NeuroOne LLC (the “LLC”), was formed on December 13, 2013 and operated as a limited liability company until it was merged with and into NeuroOne, Inc. on October 27, 2016 with NeuroOne, Inc. as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, all of the properties, rights, privileges and powers of the LLC vested in NeuroOne, Inc., and all debts, liabilities and duties of the LLC became the debts, liabilities and duties of NeuroOne, Inc., except for the license agreement (the “WARF License”) with the WARF which was not legally transferred until May 2017. The purposes of the Merger were to: change the jurisdiction of incorporation from Minnesota to Delaware; change the ownership of the LLC’s underlying assets; and convert from a limited liability company to a corporation.
 
We are a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of thin film electrode technology for cEEG and sEEG recording, brain stimulation and ablation solutions for patients suffering from epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, essential tremors and other related brain related disorders. The Company has also initiated a program to develop and commercialize electrodes targeted for spinal cord stimulation procedures to treat back-related pain from failed back surgeries. Additionally, we are investigating the potential applications of our technology associated with artificial intelligence. Members of our management team have held senior leadership positions at a number of medical technology and biopharmaceutical companies, including Boston Scientific, St. Jude Medical, Stryker Instruments, C.R. Bard, A-Med Systems, Sunshine Heart, Empi, Don-Joy and PMT.
 
We are developing our cortical, sheet and depth electrode technology to provide solutions for diagnosis through cEEG recording and sEEG recording and treatment through brain stimulation and ablation, all in one product. A cEEG is a continuous recording of the electrical activity of the brain that identifies the location of irregular brain activity, which information is required for proper treatment. cEEG recording involves an invasive surgical procedure, referred to as a craniotomy. sEEG involves a less invasive procedure whereby doctors place electrodes in targeted brain areas by drilling small holes through the skull. Both methods of seizure diagnosis are used to identify areas of the brain where epileptic seizures originate in order to precisely locate the seizure source for therapeutic treatment if possible.
 
Deep brain stimulation, or DBS, therapies involve activating or inhibiting the brain with electricity that can be given directly by electrodes on the surface or implanted deeper in the brain via depth electrodes. Introduced in 1987, this procedure involves implanting a power source referred to as a neurostimulator, which sends electrical impulses through implanted depth electrodes, to specific targets in the brain for the treatment of disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, dystonia, and chronic pain. Alzheimer’s is another indication evaluating the effects of DBS. Unlike ablative technologies, the effects of DBS are reversible.
 
RF ablation is a procedure that uses radiofrequency under the electrode contacts that is directed to the site of the brain tissue that is targeted for removal. The process involves delivering energy to the contacts, thereby heating them and destroying the brain tissue. The ablation does not remove the tissue. Rather, it is left in place and typically scar tissue forms in the place where the ablation occurs. This procedure is also known as brain lesioning as it causes irreversible lesions.
 
Failed back surgery syndrome (“FBSS”) is a condition that produces chronic lower back/leg pain due to one or more failed back surgeries. Typically, it is related to patients that suffer with pain after surgery of the lumbar spine for degenerative disc disease. Re-operations are usually not recommended for these patients due to low success rates. These patients experience greater levels of pain, a lower quality of life, varying levels of disability and higher rate of unemployment. Spinal cord stimulation works by placing an electrodes(s) in a targeted area of the spine and then connected to an implantable pulse generator that sends electrical stimulation to the electrode to block the pain signals from reaching the brain.

Our cortical sheet electrode and depth electrode technology has been tested over the years by both WARF, the owners of our licensed patents, and Mayo Clinic located in Rochester, Minnesota, in both pre-clinical models as well as through an IRB approval at Mayo Clinic for clinical research. Regarding our ablation electrode, the Cleveland Clinic has performed testing in bench top models and pre-clinical (or animal testing) modes. These pre-clinical tests have demonstrated that the technology is capable of recording, ablation and acute stimulation, although our technology remains in product development (meaning that additional trials will be needed prior to it being approved for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”)) for all of the recording (or diagnostic) and therapeutic modalities.
 
Prior to commercialization of our technology, we will have to obtain regulatory approval as discussed in “—Clinical Development and Regulatory Pathway” and “—Government Regulation” below.
 
Our Market Opportunity
 
Epilepsy Market
 
We expect to initially target the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. Epilepsy can be caused by a variety of conditions that affect a person’s brain, some of which are: stroke, brain tumor, traumatic brain injury and central nervous system infections. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”) and Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (“CURE”), there are approximately 3,000,000 patients annually suffering with epilepsy in the United States, with an additional 200,000 diagnosed every year. They also estimate that epilepsy costs the United States $15.5 billion per year. We believe the European market is similar. Approximately 720,000 of these patients are not receptive to pharmaceutical treatment and therefore are appropriate for surgical treatment of this disorder. In addition to poor quality of life, epilepsy also is associated with fairly high mortality rates, especially in children. CURE reported that Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy accounts for 34% of all deaths in children. Such deaths have increased by close to 100% from 2005 to 2015 according to the CDC. Despite the large market opportunity, it is estimated that there are only 16,000 craniotomies performed for epilepsy cases each year in the United States with 18,000 performed in Europe.1 These numbers represent an underpenetrated market due to the invasiveness of a full craniotomy required just to perform the diagnostic procedure. After the diagnostic procedure, a second therapeutic procedure is required and at times even a third surgery if the seizures persist. We believe patients are unwilling to proceed due to the long diagnostic times (one-four weeks in the hospital with a craniotomy), infection rates and 50% rate of success in the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder. As detailed above, after the diagnosis is completed, if successful, the patient must undergo an additional procedure to have the affected area of brain tissue removed. The average cost for the diagnostic technology per procedure is $10,000, with ablation devices costing $15,000 and brain stimulation devices costing $25,000 to $30,000. We believe our technology, once developed, will offer an all in one solution with diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities.
 
We believe that many leading neurologists believe that the limits of today’s current technologies are the reason the exact affected area of the brain causing epileptic seizures is not well-determined. We expect our technology, which has been developed to date by physicians at WARF and Mayo Clinic, will provide a number of advantages over the current commercially available technologies, including the following:
 

● | Our proprietary thin film technology under development has a smaller footprint with many more electrodes. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We expect that our technology will eventually be able to be implanted using a minimally invasive procedure utilizing a dime sized burr hole rather than a full craniotomy which is typically required to implant the currently available technology. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our technology may provide more accurate detection of irregular brain activity over currently available technology. In limited clinical testing, doctors at Mayo Clinic have documented pre-seizure activity (micro-seizures) during their clinical research with their patients using our cEEG technology. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We expect our technology can ablate through the electrodes as well as perform brain stimulation, allowing for diagnosis and treatment through the same product and in the same procedure.
Parkinson’s Disease
 
The Parkinson’s Disease Foundation estimates that as many as 1,000,000 patients in the United States live with Parkinson’s disease with an additional 60,000 patients diagnosed per year. Over 10,000,000 patients worldwide are living with Parkinson’s disease. There have not been any drugs introduced that have been effective at treating Parkinson’s disease. The average onset is over 60 years old but some people have been diagnosed as young as 40 years old. Parkinson’s is a disorder of the central nervous system caused by loss of brain cells throughout various regions of the brain. It is attributed to the loss of dopamine production in the brain, a messenger in the brain that allows for movement and coordination. There are no objective tests to diagnose Parkinson’s disease, and misdiagnosis rates are still very high. Doctors look to find two or more signs to make a diagnosis, including balance problems, rigidity and tremors that occur during rest. In 2011, the FDA approved the first imaging device called a DaTscan that can capture images of the dopamine system in the brain. By itself, these scans cannot diagnose Parkinson’s but can help confirm a doctor’s diagnosis. Parkinson’s disease is typically not fatal; however, complications caused by the symptoms of Parkinson’s, such as difficulty swallowing causing food to travel to the lungs resulting in pulmonary issues or falls related to loss of balance, can be fatal.
 
Today’s primary treatment for Parkinson’s disease involves medications that have not proven to resolve symptoms but rather ease symptoms. Years ago, surgical procedures such as thalamotomy and pallidotomy targeted certain parts of the brain and involved destroying the tissue. More recently, these procedures have been replaced with DBS. A doctor evaluates the patient by reviewing the patient’s symptoms and medications taken and administering detailed memory, thinking and imaging tests to determine if they are appropriate for DBS. According to the Michael J. Fox Parkinson’s Disease Research Foundation website, patients that seem to do best with DBS are those that have had the disease for at least four years and have benefited from taking medications prescribed to control the disease. In addition, DBS seems to help with reducing the issues with motor functions such as tremors, stiffness and slowness but not for balance issues. Doctors are evaluating treatment to other parts of the brain in an effort to address more symptoms to treat walking or balance issues. In addition, research is being conducted to provide stimulation when the symptoms return as opposed to all of the time.
 
Essential Tremors
 
Essential tremors are thought to be due to electrical irregularities in the brain that send abnormal signals to the muscles. It is a progressive condition that worsens over time and is linked to genetic disorders that typically appear in people who are over 40. Essential tremors usually occur alone and without any other neurological symptoms or signs. The tremors usually occur when the hands are raised and primarily affect the hands. Muscles in the trunk, face and neck may also experience symptoms. Sometimes misdiagnosed as Parkinson’s disease, essential tremors are an involuntary rhythmic shaking of the hands that is not present at rest. It is apparent during activities such as drinking, writing and eating. Symptoms can worsen due to stress, anxiety, smoking, caffeine, fatigue, etc. Genetics Home Reference estimates that as many as 10,000,000 people in the United States are affected by the disease. Treatments for the disease include medical therapy, weighting the limbs and DBS. Patients need to eliminate any medications they are taking that cause tremors as this can exacerbate the symptoms. For some patients, using wrist weights may ease symptoms allowing the patient to function. Other patients may also use relaxation techniques as stress can increase symptoms. Medical therapy is also used to treat patients’ symptoms. Primidone is typically the first drug prescribed as it has had success in some situations for epilepsy. Botox is also used at times to control head tremors. When these fail, surgery is the next alternative. A surgical procedure used years ago created lesions in the ventral intermediate thalamus and was highly successful with treating essential tremors but is no longer commonly used due to increased risk of developing speech problems. The latest therapy is DBS, which, unlike other therapies, is reversible and programmable, helping to adjust the settings to maximize patient benefit. Similar to Parkinson’s disease, the ability to detect this irregular brain activity before it causes a tremor is highly desirable.

Dystonia
 
Dystonia is a neurological condition recognized as a motion disorder that involves over activity of a variety of different muscles simultaneously that work against each other. It presents itself in a variety of symptoms but typically involves repetitive, patterned and often twisting involuntary muscle contractions resembling tremors. According to the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, over 300,000 people are affected in the United States and Canada alone. Dystonia is the third most common problem seen in movement disorder clinics. Because it has many different manifestations, it is often misdiagnosed. In addition, similar to Parkinson’s disease, there are no specific tests that can positively diagnose dystonia. A doctor typically will evaluate patient and family history, potentially do genetic testing, EEG testing, blood and urine tests. There are also many treatment options for patients but depend on the type of dystonia. Botox and certain medications may be helpful or DBS may be used.
Spinal Cord Stimulation
 
The market for spinal cord stimulation was reported to be $1.97 billion in the United States in 2017 as reported by Infinium Research in their Spinal Cord Stimulation Market Research report. The market includes the following indications: Failed Back Surgery Syndrome, Ischemic Limb Pain, and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. Over half of this market is comprised of patients with FBSS. Certain studies have indicated a benefit for these patients suffering from chronic back and lower limb pain when they have been treated with electrical stimulation. Prior to the patient receiving an implant, they undergo a trial period that allows them to determine if they are receiving relief from the therapy while preventing a surgery to implant the pulse generator that provides the stimulation. If the trial period is successful, then the device is implanted in a follow-up procedure.
Artificial Intelligence
 
The brain consists of approximately 100 billion nerve cells, which are small wires that pass electrical signals to control all of its functions. There have been a number of successful clinical trials in which small metal wires, known as electrodes, are implanted in the brain to correct nerve damage using wireless communication between implanted wires to simulate functional nerve cells. In addition to correcting damaged nerve cells, certain scientists have theorized that if millions of wires could be implanted in the brain, these electrodes could present an opportunity to use artificial intelligence to create infrared sight, increase hearing or perfect memory recall. However, there currently is no commercially available manufacturing platform capable of making thousands of wires that can be placed within or on the brain and work reliably for the lifetime of a subject, and are soft enough to match the tissue of the brain, that avoid damage to the brain.
Limitations of Currently Available Therapies
 
There are a limited number of currently available products for diagnosis and treatment for people with neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Although the currently available systems provide diagnosis and treatment for patients, they have certain inherent limitations and shortcomings that we believe limit their use and validate the need for improved technology in the market. These limitations include:

● | Lengthy diagnostic times: Patients spend one to four weeks in the hospital waiting to have seizures that will allow doctors to determine where the seizures are occurring. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lower Accuracy: Historically, clinical electrode manufacturers primarily provided electrodes that sample brain tissue at approximately centimeter spacial scales. Advances in digital EEG acquisition have made recordings at sub-millimeter spatial scales possible, but high-spatial resolution EEG has been slow to impact clinical practice. Existing, higher spatial scales increase the potential for missing data that may be critical in the removal of brain tissue causing the irregular activity. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Need to perform a full craniotomy (invasiveness): Currently available cortical electrode technology is placed through a craniotomy, which requires removing the top part of the cranium and is a very painful and invasive procedure. Procedural times for a craniotomy range from a minimum of four to eight hours. A variety of complications can occur when a full craniotomy is performed, including but not limited to: stroke, bleeding, infection, seizures, swelling of the brain (which may require a second craniotomy), nerve damage, which may cause muscle paralysis or weakness, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, which may require repair, loss of mental functions and permanent brain damage with associated disabilities. The invasiveness, procedural times and possible surgical complications have limited the growth of surgical treatment of epilepsy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Requirement for a surgical incision: Currently, when patients have been implanted with paddle electrodes in the spinal area, a surgical incision has been required. A technology that allows for percutaneous placement is desirable. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Limited number of contacts on an electrode: Paddle electrodes currently are available in a variety of sizes and number of contacts. Physicians want to explore adding a greater number of contacts on the same electrode in order to be able to be more precise in stimulating targeted areas.

Our Solution
 
As a result of the inherent limitations and inconvenience of existing systems, we believe that there is a significant unmet need among people with neurological disorders for cortical strip, grid and depth electrodes that provide diagnostic capabilities through cEEG and sEEG recording in addition to therapeutic modalities, such as brain stimulation and ablation, offered as an all in one product. In comparison to currently available technologies, we are currently developing our strip, grid and depth electrodes with the goal of providing the following expected advantages:

● | Reduced time for diagnosis: If we are successful in identifying brain activity more quickly, in offering a minimally invasive procedure and developing an all in one solution, we expect our technology will reduce overall procedural times. While our pre-clinical and clinical experience to date is very limited, our cortical grid technology under development has, in some cases, demonstrated the ability to provide hi fidelity recordings that have allowed physicians to identify the affected brain tissue causing seizures in hours versus weeks. This represents the potential for meaningful cost savings for hospitals and patients and improved quality of life for patients. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improved accuracy of diagnostic technologies: Because we believe our thin film technology will be capable of recording at higher fidelity than current technologies used in EEG recording, we believe our technology may be able to more precisely determine the brain tissue causing seizures. Additionally, in the limited clinical tests performed by Mayo Clinic with five patients to date, our technology under development has identified what clinicians refer to as pre-seizure activity (made possible by the ability to detect brain activity using sub-millimeter spatial scales). We believe our technology under development may be able to improve outcomes compared to using other therapeutic technologies regardless of whether we are able to offer an all in one diagnostic and therapeutic solution. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implantation via minimally invasive procedure with fewer post-procedure complications: We are currently developing an approach to deliver the cortical electrodes, including minimizing the invasiveness of the procedure. We expect that patients who have qualified for this therapy will be more accepting of a minimally-invasive procedure. Such a procedure would potentially reduce the patient’s pain, bleeding and other adverse events associated with a full craniotomy. Our technology is expected to also have fewer wires, also referred to as tails, exiting the patient’s head, which can also reduce the potential for infections. Furthermore, the material we currently use in our cortical electrodes has shown in pre-clinical evaluations to cause less inflammation than current electrode substrates as it appears more compatible with brain tissue. As discussed under “Our Strategy” below, our technology under development, if approved, will be implanted via a full craniotomy until such time, if ever, as we are able to develop our minimally invasive procedure. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All-in-one diagnostic and therapeutic technology solution: Due to the expected high fidelity recording capabilities of our technology under development, we have received feedback from physicians that they will attempt to perform the diagnosis and treatment in a single procedure, thereby eliminating the need for a second surgical procedure, reducing the likelihood of patient infection and minimizing the diagnostic, procedural and hospital costs. As discussed under “Our Strategy” below, our initial product offering will offer diagnostic-only capabilities while we advance the development of our all in one approach. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Percutaneous placement of spinal cord stimulation paddle electrodes with scalability options: Due to the thin film nature of our electrode technology, we believe that it may allow for percutaneous placement, thereby preventing the need to make surgical incisions to place the electrodes. Minimally invasive and percutaneously placed technologies have become almost a requirement for adoption with patients and physicians. In addition, our technology offers the ability to increase the number of contacts on a film that traditionally offers fewer contacts. Increasing the number of contacts may allow for more precise stimulation in the spine, potentially improving the therapeutic outcomes.

Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to be the global leader in cEEG and sEEG recording, deep brain stimulation and ablation, owning the procedure from diagnosis through treatment. The key elements of our strategy include:

● | Introduce cortical strip and grid electrodes for the diagnosis of epilepsy in United States: In December 2019, we announced that we received U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance to market our thin film cortical electrode technology for temporary (less than 30 days) recording, monitoring, and stimulation on the surface of the brain. Our initial product offering will be placed through traditional surgical means involving a craniotomy until such time, if any, that we launch our minimally invasive procedure. We believe, due to physician feedback, that our technology under development would represent a major improvement over existing cortical electrodes for the recording of brain activity. We are initially targeting epilepsy as we believe this is a clinical area of great need and a market that is underserved with a quick path to commercialization. We believe the largest and quickest-to-market geography for our cortical strip and grid technology under development is in the United States for a number of reasons, including the following: (i) many industry sources believe there is a large underserved U.S. market, (ii) healthy procedural reimbursement for centers and physicians, (iii) robust average selling prices, (iv) physician enthusiasm for our technology under development.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Launch depth electrodes for sEEG recording: Given the reluctance of patients to undergo epilepsy surgery due to its invasiveness, a number of epilepsy centers have adopted the use of depth electrodes, which are placed by drilling small holes into the patient’s cranium, thereby avoiding a craniotomy. We believe our technology will offer advantages to current depth electrode technology and will enable us to offer a therapeutic solution using this technology in the future. As we develop our technology, we plan to release further information about the expected advantages of our technology over currently available therapies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Introduce minimally invasive delivery system for cortical electrodes: Cortical electrodes generally require a craniotomy, which is a very invasive procedure that can cause patient complications. Because of this, many patients have opted to not have epilepsy surgery, instead accepting the consequences and risks associated with epilepsy. We intend to develop a procedure that may include a delivery system placed through a small circular incision in the skull for implantation of the cortical grid and strip electrodes. We believe this will increase patient willingness to accept the surgery and increase market penetration. Until we are able to develop this procedure, if at all, our initial product offering will be placed through traditional surgical means involving a craniotomy and may be less likely to be adopted by physicians and patients due to unwillingness of patients to undergo epilepsy surgery. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop percutaneous placed electrodes for spinal cord stimulation with scalable contact configurations: Given that many surgically placed technologies have become less invasive due to patient and physician demands, we believe that our flexible thin film technology will allow for percutaneous placement, thus potentially eliminating the need to make a surgical incision. By leveraging our existing FDA cleared cortical electrode technology, we may be able to offer the ability to improve precision of where the stimulation is delivered. NeuroOne’s platform thin film technology has the capability to increase the number of contacts in a similar footprint that has fewer contacts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilize these core technologies to develop all in one diagnostic and therapeutic solutions: Patients currently undergo one surgical procedure for diagnosis (either to have a cortical electrode placed via a craniotomy or depth electrodes placed via holes drilled into the skull) and, hopefully after the brain recordings successfully indicate where the affected brain tissue is located, a second procedure or surgery is then required to treat the patient. There is strong physician interest in being able to perform both the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure concurrently. We are developing our technology with the goal of being able to offer this benefit although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. We are pursuing cortical grid, strip and depth electrode technology that can record brain activity (diagnose), ablate brain tissue and also provide both acute and long term stimulation. The technology has demonstrated these functions in acute and short term animal models; however, additional development is required to offer a device that has long term therapeutic application. These therapeutic technologies are expected to require more robust regulatory approvals for the United States, ranging from a 510(k) with human clinical data to PMAs. We will engage the FDA at the proper time to determine the most efficient clinical path. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Gain approval for other brain or motor related disorders such as Parkinson’s with the therapeutic technologies developed for epilepsy: While we are developing our technology for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, we believe that our technology has strong application and utilization for other brain or motor related disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, essential tremors and facial pain as these diseases are currently treated with DBS if medications are not effective. As previously mentioned, we are planning to offer electrodes that can be implanted for long term stimulation applications, but such use will require that we pursue additional approvals from the FDA and any international regulatory bodies where we seek to commercialize our technology. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Explore partnerships with other companies that leverage our core technology: Given that our technology enables, complements and/or competes with a number of companies that are in the market or attempting to enter the market with diagnostic or therapeutic technologies to treat brain related disorders, we believe there may be opportunities to establish mutually beneficial relationships. In addition, our technology may have application in cardiovascular, orthopedic and pain related indications that could benefit from a hi-fidelity thin film electrode product that can provide stimulation and/or ablation therapies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Investigate the potential applications associated with Artificial Intelligence: We have been informed by some of our corporate advisors that the ability to offer scale-able electrode technology that can provide thousands of electrodes in the brain may be helpful in treating medical conditions that may benefit from using artificial intelligence. The Company has formed an advisory board that will provide guidance to the Company as we continue to explore the opportunities in this exciting field.

Our Technology
 
Epilepsy Mapping and Monitoring
 
Epileptic seizures occur when the neurons in the brain miscommunicate. This miscommunication typically results in involuntary muscle seizure activities and/or periods of perceptual disconnect where the individual appears frozen. Modern medical science has advanced the treatment of epileptic seizures by mapping the electrical communication activity of neurons and understanding their special orientation in the brain. This mapping is accomplished by access to the cranium (through a craniotomy) and placing conductive contacts on the brain directly. The craniotomy procedure is very invasive, traumatic to the surrounding tissue, results in high patient down time, and increases the risk of infection.
Our Technology
 
We seek to leverage scale-able technology and produce ultra-thin, or paper-thin electrodes that allow for high-resolution and high-definition recordings, which would improve mapping resolution and signal acquisition. If the Company is able to leverage scale-able technology, it would mean that our technology would be able to incorporate smaller electrodes and thereby increase the number of electrodes on a given surface area. We expect that this would increase the imaging resolution so that brain activity is displayed in greater definition. We also believe that the electrodes’ unique thinness and flexibility will provide a less invasive approach to electrode placement. The electrodes would be able to be placed through a small quarter size hole instead of by an invasive full craniotomy procedure.
 

The images under “Cortical Electrode,” from bottom to top, are images of our cortical electrode strip, our grid electrode, and the placement of the grid electrode on the brain, respectively. The images under “High Density Interconnect” are both images of our product that connects our electrodes to the head box, which is a piece of hardware that connects to electrodes to acquire, amplify, display, store and archive electrophysiological signals, and is integrated as part of our manufactured electrode product. The images under “Head Box” and “Signal Monitoring and Mapping” are images of the device which processes information received through the high density interconnect, and a sample output of data acquisition, respectively, neither of which is one of a Company product.

Our technology consists of three primary types of cortical electrodes: grid electrodes, strip electrodes and dual-sided electrodes. These electrodes have a patented design that utilizes proprietary processing and materials technology, which we believe will allow the electrodes to have improved features over the current industry standard recording electrodes.
 
What sets our technology apart from others is the integration of state of the art design leveraging the latest in flexible printed circuit technology. We believe our patented designs will provide the surgeon a higher tactile perspective on electrode placement allowing for ultra-precise neuron recording. We expect the benefits of our electrode designs to include the ability to detect better defined margins between healthy tissue and resect-able tissue, less immune-response from the brain and surrounding tissue, better signal acquisition due to superior conformability of the electrode over the brain, improved flexibility that physicians have requested, which we expect will enable a minimally invasive approach and the electrodes unique thinness that is unmatched by current products being used.
 
The Future of Neurology Mapping with NeuroOne
 
We seek to develop superior “scale-able” technology for future product system iterations in higher density contact placement. This will open the doors to other brain related disease recording procedures by providing hi-fidelity, more accurate diagnostic capabilities and also the ability to provide an all in one therapy capable of diagnosis, ablation and/or stimulation. Beyond the brain, we believe our technology under development has applications in other neurological signal recording disease states related to voluntary or involuntary motor neuron abnormalities, understanding sensory neuro behavior (pain), limb prosthetics and degenerative muscle disease.
 
Clinical Development and Regulatory Pathway
 
Clinical Experience, Future Development and Clinical Trial Plans
 
Our technology under development has not been approved for commercialization by any U.S. or foreign regulatory body. To date, the Company has performed a number of bench top (which includes feasibility testing) and pre-clinical tests (which include animal testing of device placement, ergonomics, performance, ease of use, and other tests required by FDA regulations). As described in “—Government Regulation” below, the Company will be required to perform additional testing of its technology in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.
 
In parallel with the development and testing needed to launch our cortical strip and grid electrodes, we intend to expand our product offerings to include less invasive means and all in one solutions, thus providing both patients and physicians better options to treat epilepsy and other brain related disorders. While we expect to make modifications to this initial system, we believe that most of our future product development initiatives will involve unique and transformational next generation technology that should drive further appeal of our products with both physicians and patients.
 
We are utilizing a number of resources to develop these technologies. We license three critical patents from WARF that are the foundation of the technology and we are developing and intend to commercialize and benefit from the thin film technology know-how of Mayo Clinic doctors through our license and development agreement. WARF, Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic have been responsible for all pre-clinical studies of our technology under development to date. See “—WARF License” and “—Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research License and Development Agreement” below.

Below we have summarized, for each component of our technology under development, the current stage of development, the pre-clinical testing done to date by WARF, The Cleveland Clinic or Mayo Clinic on such component, if any, our plans for further testing or clinical trials and our expectations regarding the requirements for regulatory approval and timing of regulatory submissions:
 

Technology | Stage of Development and Pre-Clinical Testing to Date | Additional Expected Steps for Regulatory Approval 
-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cortical strip and grid electrodes for the diagnosis of epilepsy | The Company has finalized the design for the product and there are no further expected changes to the device (“design freeze”). Pre-clinical testing and clinical testing on the final design has been conducted by Mayo Clinic and WARF (as described in “Mayo Clinic Studies” below). The Company received FDA 510(k) clearance in the fourth calendar quarter of 2019. | There may be continued clinical evaluation of the technology under a pre-existing IRB research protocol approved by Mayo’s institutional review board, which will provide us with additional clinical evidence that may assist with product acceptance and launch. Commercial launch is in process. 
Depth electrodes for recording (diagnostic) purposes | Design freeze for one design; currently there are additional alternative designs under evaluation. Bench top testing and pre-clinical tests (animal testing) were conducted in the third and fourth calendar quarters of 2018. No clinical testing has been conducted to date. | The Company is currently evaluating two additional alternative designs for this product. Design freeze was completed in the fourth calendar quarter of 2018 for one of the three designs in consideration. Additional pre-clinical tests (including safety and performance tests) expected to occur in the first calendar quarter of 2020. The tests will need to demonstrate: biocompatibility (including extractables/leachables (whether the product results in any leaching of metals), and ease of implantation), which we estimate will require $100,000; Sterilization validation and adoption, which we estimate will require $25,000 to complete; and Electrical safety, which we estimate will require $60,000 to complete. Pending the outcome of these tests, we expect to file for FDA 510(k) marketing clearance for one design in the second calendar quarter of 2020. 
Minimally invasive cortical electrode delivery system | No design freeze. An initial pre-clinical feasibility study was conducted by the Mayo Clinic utilizing their device with our cortical film technology in December 2018. Additional testing was completed at the University of Minnesota in the second and third calendar quarters of 2019. | Pre-clinical testing was conducted in the first calendar quarter of 2019, and regulatory requirements will continue to be evaluated as we develop the design of this product. The Company conducted additional cadaver studies in the second and third calendar quarters of 2019. The Mayo Clinic is conducting testing of its own device. In the event the Mayo Clinic completes development of its own device prior to us, we may forego completing development of our device and seek to enter into an arrangement with Mayo Clinic relating to its device (such as, for example, an acquisition/licensing, or distribution agreement). Otherwise, to complete development of our own device, testing will need to demonstrate design verification, which we estimate will require $50,000.

Depth electrode diagnostic and ablation devices | No design freeze. Pre-clinical testing, including benchtop and animal testing, has been conducted on early designs. No clinical testing has been conducted to date. The Company has partnered with the Cleveland Clinic to co-develop the product. | Additional pre-clinical testing at the Cleveland Clinic was completed in the second calendar quarter of 2020. Once the design is finalized we will be required to conduct additional pre-clinical testing, which may include additional benchtop or animal testing for safety and performance. Additionally, the FDA may require that we conduct human clinical studies. No FDA feedback has been sought or received by us to date on the clinical process that may be required for an ablation indication, but we expect regulatory clearance/approval will require a more robust clinical process, which could range from 510(k) clearance with human clinical data to a PMA, depending on proposed indications for use. We expect that we will need to demonstrate design verification, which we estimate will require $75,000 to complete, biocompatibility, which we estimate will require $100,000 to complete, and sterilization validation and adoption, which we estimate will require $25,000 to complete. We may also need to demonstrate electrical safety, which we estimate will require $60,000. Future pre-clinical and clinical testing requirements for regulatory clearance will continue to be evaluated as we develop the design of this product

Spinal cord stim electrodes | No design freeze. No pre-clinical or clinical testing to date. | This device is in early stages of development. We expect to perform pre-clinical testing in mid-2020. Once the design is finalized we will be required to conduct additional pre-clinical testing, which may include additional benchtop or animal testing for safety and performance. Additionally, the FDA may require that we conduct human clinical studies. No FDA feedback has been sought or received by us to date on the clinical process that may be required for an ablation indication, but we expect regulatory clearance/approval will require a more robust clinical process, which could range from 510(k) clearance with human clinical data to a PMA, depending on proposed indications for use. We expect that we will need to demonstrate design verification, which we estimate will require $75,000 to complete, biocompatibility, which we estimate will require $100,000 to complete, and sterilization validation and adoption, which we estimate will require $25,000 to complete. We may also need to demonstrate electrical safety, which we estimate will require $60,000. Future pre-clinical and clinical testing requirements for regulatory clearance will continue to be evaluated as we develop the design of this product

Depth electrode chronic stimulation devices | No design freeze. No pre-clinical testing, or clinical testing has been conducted to date | This device is in early development, and we do not expect to begin conducting bench top nor pre-clinical testing until the fourth calendar quarter of 2019. Following a design freeze, we will be required to conduct additional pre-clinical testing, which may include additional benchtop or animal testing for safety and performance. Additionally, FDA-approved human clinical studies will most likely be required. No FDA feedback has been sought or received by us to date on the clinical process that will be required for chronic stimulation, but we expect regulatory clearance/approval for chronic stimulation may require a more robust clinical process, which could range from 510(k) clearance with human clinical data to a PMA. Because we have not yet met with the FDA, we cannot yet determine what clinical data and testing we will need to complete or what the testing will need to demonstrate. However, we believe, based on the experience of competitors for similar technology, that we will need to conduct clinical trials, which we estimate will require approximately $1,000,000, as well as demonstrate biocompatibility, which we estimate will require $100,000 to complete, and demonstrate sterilization validation and adoption, which we estimate will require $25,000 to complete.

Mayo Clinic Studies
 
Our cortical technology for the diagnosis of epilepsy has been tested by doctors at Mayo Clinic in multiple pre-clinical tests conducted from 2012 to 2017. In pre-clinical models, doctors examined the biological impact on mammalian brains. Polyimide substrate electrodes (NeuroOne technology) were implanted on the pig’s brain for one week alongside standard competitive electrodes. The tissue underneath the two types of electrodes was removed, fixed, stained, and examined for immunological responses. The results of a histological (evaluation of brain tissue under a microscope) analysis showed reduced immunological reaction to prolonged polyimide substrate implants (NeuroOne technology) compared to standard silicone substrate clinical electrodes. Electrophysiological recordings showed data obtained from polyimide electrodes which showed the feasibility of high fidelity multi-scale electrophysiology while also displaying easier deployment of polyimide electrodes (NeuroOne technology) through minimally invasive burr holes.
 
Additionally, doctors implanted our polyimide thin film electrodes on five human patients who were undergoing surgery to remove brain tissue for drug resistant epilepsy. Electrophysiological recordings from the polyimide thin film technology displayed in each of these patients demonstrated micro-seizure activity due to the high fidelity multi-scale electrophysiology.
 
Conclusions reached by the physicians at Mayo Clinic were that thin, flexible polyimide electrodes (NeuroOne technology) provided recordings similar to standard clinical electrodes with reduced immunological response. In addition, the flexibility of polyimide electrodes may reduce pain and swelling associated with implantation of the device, and the single wire exiting the skull may reduce infection risk. The ability to record micro-seizure and single neuron brain activity may also provide additional useful clinical data. Combined, these properties suggest that the replacement of our current competitive silicone electrodes with polyimide substrate electrodes (NeuroOne technology) for recording brain activity for epilepsy could provide enhanced clinical value with reduced cost, reduced infection risk, and improved patient comfort.
 
In addition, our thin film cortical implant technology has been tested by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in multiple pre-clinical animal studies conducted from 2006 to 2016, which included mice, rats and primates. In these studies, our technology was able to record brain activity from different areas of the brain, was implanted in a minimally invasive fashion, electrically provided brain stimulation and tissue ablation, and had increased flexibility compared to existing commercially available technology, which allowed the grids to conform more easily to the brain surface (and may have reduced pain and swelling, compared to less flexible devices).
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Based on the size and maturity of the U.S. market, our initial commercial focus, if our technology is approved for commercialization for the diagnosis of epilepsy in the United States, will be to invest in developing a direct sales force and infrastructure to support the launch of the product in the United States and target what we estimate to be approximately 188 Level 4 epilepsy centers along with their respective epilepsy teams comprised of neurologists, neurosurgeons and technicians in the United States who are clinically active.
 
In parallel, we have evaluated the opportunity to commercialize our products in select European markets and have concluded that while there is a market for our technology in Europe, the regulatory changes in the European Union will require a lengthy and costly approval pathway. At this time, we will utilize our resources to remain focused on the opportunity in the United States but will reexamine international opportunities at a later time. If our technology is approved for commercialization for the diagnosis of epilepsy in the United States, we will look to educate neurologists, neurosurgeons and primary care physicians on the advantages to existing epilepsy approaches through a variety of targeted marketing tools and social media.

Reimbursement
 
Coverage in the United States
 
Reimbursement from private third-party healthcare payors and, to a lesser extent, Medicare will be an important element of our success. Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and third-party payors have adopted coverage policies for our targeted indications, there is no guarantee this will continue at the same levels or at all in the future. Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, is a medical code set that is used to report medical, surgical and diagnostic procedures and services to entities such as physicians, health insurance companies and accreditation organizations.
 
Applicable diagnostic CPT codes for mapping (diagnosing) the brain for diagnostic procedures are as follows:
 

● | 61531 Subdural implantation of strip electrodes through one or more burr or trephine (saw) hole(s) for long-term seizure monitoring; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 61533 Craniotomy with elevation of bone flap: for subdural implantation of an electrode array, for long term seizure monitoring; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 61535 Craniotomy with elevation of bone flap; for removal of epidural or subdural electrode array, without excision of cerebral tissue (separate procedure); and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 61760 Stereotactic implantation of depth electrodes into the cerebrum for long term seizure monitoring. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Regarding ICD-10 codes, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) is a clinical cataloging system that went into effect for the U.S. healthcare industry on October 1, 2015, after a series of lengthy delays. Accounting for modern advances in clinical treatment and medical devices, ICD-10 codes offer many more classification options compared to those found in its predecessor, ICD-9. Within the healthcare industry, providers, coders, IT professionals, insurance carriers, government agencies and others use ICD codes to properly note diseases on health records, to track epidemiological trends and to assist in medical reimbursement decisions.
 
ICD-10 codes for epilepsy are as follows:
 

● | G40.0 Localization-related (focal) (partial) idiopathic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with seizures of localized onset; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.1 Localization-related (focal) (partial) symptomatic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with simple partial seizures; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.2 Localization-related (focal) (partial) symptomatic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with complex partial seizures; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.3 Generalized idiopathic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.A Absence epileptic syndrome; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.4 Other generalized epilepsy and epileptic syndromes; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.50 Epileptic seizures related to external causes, not intractable; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.80 Other epilepsy; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.82 Epileptic spasms. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that many of the indications we are pursuing with our technologies are currently reimbursed on a widespread basis by Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies.
 
Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new medical devices, and, as a result, their coverage policies may be restrictive, or they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. In order to obtain reimbursement arrangements, we may have to agree to a net sales price lower than the net sales price we might charge in other sales channels. Our revenue may be limited by the continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various increasingly sophisticated means, such as requiring prospective reimbursement and second opinions, purchasing in groups, or redesigning benefits. Our future dependence on the commercial success of our technologies makes us particularly susceptible to any cost containment or reduction efforts. Accordingly, unless government and other third-party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products and the related insertion and removal procedures, our financial performance may be limited.
 
Coverage Outside the United States
 
If we seek to commercialize in countries outside the United States, coverage for epilepsy surgical procedures are available from certain governmental authorities, private health insurance plans, and labor unions. Coverage systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region. If we seek to commercialize our technology, if approved, outside the United States, coverage approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country, region-by-region or, in some instances, a case-by case basis. Based on our ongoing evaluation, certain countries reimburse more highly than others.
 
We evaluated international opportunities to market our technology under development. While we believe there is a market for our technology in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions, we have determined not to seek to commercialize in any foreign jurisdictions due to time intensive approval processes, the lack of certainty regarding approval, significant cost and the stringency of the regulatory approval process in Europe in particular, among other factors.
 
Manufacturing, Supply and Quality Assurance
 
We currently outsource the supply and manufacture of all components of our prototypes of our technology under development. We plan to continue with an outsourced manufacturing arrangement for the foreseeable future. Our third-party manufacturers are recognized in their field for their competency to manufacture the respective portions of our system and have quality systems established that meet FDA requirements. We believe the manufacturers we currently utilize have sufficient capacity to meet our launch requirements if our technology under development is approved in the future and are able to scale up their capacity relatively quickly with minimal capital investment. We believe that, as we increase our demand in the future, our per-unit costs will decrease materially. We have also identified capable second source manufacturers and suppliers in the event of disruption from any of our primary vendors.
 
Our suppliers meet the latest ISO 13485 certification, which includes design control requirements. As a medical device developer, the facilities of our sterilization and other critical suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies. We believe that our quality systems and those of our suppliers are robust and achieve high product quality. We plan to audit our suppliers periodically to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our devices.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development team, which includes our Chief Technology Officer and two third party consultants who perform research and development activities for us, is focused on the development of thin film cortical grid and strip electrodes and depth electrodes for recording, ablation and chronic stimulation for brain related disorders as well as stimulation for spinal cord stimulation for back related pain.
 
14

 

Our research and development expenses were $1.5 million and $1.0 million for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
Competition
 
In the market for Epilepsy diagnosis, our cortical strip, sheet and depth electrode technology will likely compete with Integra Life Science’s Integra Epilepsy Strip, Grid and depth electrodes, which provide a similar function to our diagnostic technologies under development. These products are well established in the marketplace and Integra has greater resources than us, which could allow them to innovate faster. Ad-Tech Medical Instrument Corporation’s Epilepsy/LTM (subdural grid, strip and depth) electrodes, which have become the market leaders for diagnostic mapping in epilepsy, and PMT’s Cortac Strips and grid electrodes and Depthalon depth electrodes are used for recording brain activity similar to other competitive technologies. In addition, Dixie Medical has launched a product line of depth electrodes and CorTec has launched a cortical electrode product line called AirRay. Today’s success rates for seizure free post-operative conditions remain at 50%, which has limited patients’ willingness to undergo the currently highly invasive surgical procedure. We will also compete against other companies in early stages of development of thin film technologies.
 
In the neuro-ablation market, we expect to compete with Medtronic’s Visualase guided-laser ablation technology and Monteris Medical’s NeuroBlate technology, which use MRI guided laser surgical ablation for use to ablate, necrotize or coagulate soft tissue through interstitial irradiation or thermal therapy in medicine and surgery in the discipline of neurosurgery with 1064 nm lasers. Their website claims it is used for ablation in the brain for soft tissue and tumors. We believe there are other laser-based systems in development that will compete with these technologies.
 
In the neurostimulation market, we expect to compete with NeuroPace’s RNS system approved for epilepsy, Medtronic’s Activa system approved for Parkinson’s disease, Boston Scientific Vercise (indicated for Parkinson’s, dystonia and essential tremors), Abbott/St. Jude Medical’s Infinity DBS system (approved for Parkinson’s disease and essential tremors), Liva Nova/Cyberonic’s VNS therapy intended for patients suffering with epilepsy. We believe there are additional companies pursuing thin film electrode technology for use in the brain although none are expected to be commercially available in 2019. Although we will face potential competition from many different sources, we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources will provide us with competitive advantages. We expect the key competitive factors affecting the success of our cortical strip and sheet electrodes under development, if successfully developed and approved, are likely to be: hi-fidelity recording that allows for detection of pre-seizure activity, ability to place the devices minimally invasively, deliverability of cortical grid, strip and depth electrode technology, ability to offer grid, strip and depth electrodes in various electrode shapes and sizes, potential reduction in infections and ability to record brain activity both on the surface using cortical grid and strip technology and deeper into the brain using depth electrodes concurrently.
 
Many of the companies against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our development.
 
WARF License
 
We have an Exclusive Start-Up Company License Agreement with WARF, pursuant to which WARF has granted us the WARF License, to make, use and sell, in the United States only, products that employ certain licensed patents for a neural probe array or thin-film micro electrode array and method. We have agreed to pay WARF a royalty equal to a single-digit percentage of our product sales pursuant to the WARF License, with a minimum annual royalty payment of $50,000 for 2019, $100,000 for 2020 and $150,000 for 2021 and each calendar year thereafter that the WARF License is in effect. If we or any of our sublicenses contest the validity of any licensed patent, the royalty rate will be doubled during the pendency of such contest and, if the contested patent is found to be valid and would be infringed by us if not for the WARF License, the royalty rate will be tripled for the remaining term of the WARF License.
 
15

 

We have agreed to diligently develop, manufacture, market and sell products under the WARF License in the United States during the term of the agreement and, specifically, that we would submit a business plan to WARF by February 1, 2018, which we submitted on January 18, 2018, and would file an application for 510(k) marketing clearance with the FDA by February 1, 2019, which we submitted on January 28, 2019. WARF may terminate this license on 30 days’ written notice, if we default on the payments of amounts due to WARF or fail to timely submit development reports, actively pursue our development plan or breach any other covenant in the WARF License and fail to remedy such default in 90 days or in the event of certain bankruptcy events involving us. WARF may also terminate the WARF License (i) on 90 days’ notice if we fail to have commercial sales of one or more FDA-approved products under the WARF License by March 31, 2020 or (ii) if, after royalties earned on sales begin to be paid, such earned royalties cease for more than four calendar quarters. The WARF License otherwise expires by its terms on the date that no valid claims on the patents licensed thereunder remain. We expect the latest expiration of a licensed patent to occur in 2030.
 
In addition, WARF reserves the right to grant non-profit research institutions and government agencies non-exclusive licenses to practice and use the inventions of the licensed patents for non-commercial research purposes, and we grant WARF a non-exclusive, sub licensable, royalty-free right and license for non-commercial research purposes to use improvements to the licensed patents. In the event that we discontinue use or commercialization of the licensed patents or improvements thereon, we must grant WARF an option to obtain a non-exclusive, sub-licensable royalty-bearing license to use the improvements for commercial purposes.
 
See “Risk Factors”— We depend on intellectual property licensed from WARF for our technology under development, and the termination of this license would harm our business” for additional information regarding the WARF License.
 
Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research License and Development Agreement
 
We have entered into the Amended and Restated License and Development Agreement (the “Mayo Development Agreement”) with Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“Mayo”) to license worldwide (i) certain know how for the development and commercialization of products, methods and processes related to flexible circuit thin film technology for the recording of tissue and (ii) the products developed therefrom, and to partner with Mayo to assist the Company in the investigation, research application, development and improvement of such technology. Mayo has agreed to assist us by providing access to certain individuals at Mayo, or the Mayo Principal Investigators, in developing our cortical thin film flexible circuit technology, including prototype development, animal testing, protocol development for human and animal use, abstract development and presentation and access to and license of any intellectual property that the Mayo Principal Investigators develop relating to the procedure.
 
We have agreed to pay Mayo a royalty equal to a single-digit percentage of our product sales pursuant to the Mayo Development Agreement. Mayo may purchase any developed products licensed under the Mayo Development Agreement at the best price offered by us to the end user in the prior year. The Mayo Development Agreement generally will expire in October 2034, unless the Mayo know-how and improvements under the Mayo Development Agreement remain in use, and the Mayo Development Agreement may be terminated by Mayo for cause or under certain circumstances.
 
For additional information regarding the Mayo Development Agreement, see “Risk Factors—We depend on our partnership with Mayo to license certain know how for the development and commercialization of our technology. Termination of this partnership would harm our business, and even if this partnership continues, it may not be successful.”
 
Intellectual Property
 
Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets as well as nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements, material transfer agreements, confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
 
16

 

Patents
 
As of September 30, 2019, our patent estate consists of three issued United States patents licensed from WARF covering a neural probe array and thin-film micro electrode array and method and two pending U.S. patent applications filed by us and published on October 11, 2018 covering our applications and additional devices used during the diagnostic and therapeutic ablation and stimulation procedures. In addition, we filed a provisional patent in March 2019 to include coatings for application on our thin film electrode technology, a provisional patent application filed in June 2019 relating to minimally invasive delivery devices, electrodes, and related methods, and we filed a patent application in August 2019 relating to our spinal cord stimulation electrode advancements for patients suffering with nerve-related back pain. The licensed issued patents expire between 2025 and 2030, subject to any patent extensions that may be available for such patents. If a patent or patents are issued on our pending patent application, the resulting patent is projected to expire in 2038.
 
Our patent application may not result in an issued patent, and any patents that have been issued or may be issued in the future may not protect the commercially important aspects of our technology. Furthermore, the validity and enforceability of our issued patents may be challenged by third parties and our patents could be invalidated or modified by the issuing governmental authority. Third parties may independently develop technology that is not covered by our patents that is similar to, or competes with, our technology. In addition, our intellectual property may be infringed or misappropriated by third parties, particularly in foreign countries where the laws and governmental authorities may not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as those in the United States.
 
The medical device industry in general, and the recording, ablation and neurostimulation sector of this industry in particular, are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on assertions of patent infringement. We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that may relate to the technology used in our business, including the design and manufacture of electrodes and pulse generators, as well as methods for device placement. Each of these patents contains multiple claims, any one of which may be independently asserted against us. The owners of these patents may assert that the manufacture, use, sale or offer for sale of our cortical strip and sheet electrodes infringe one or more claims of their patents. Furthermore, there may be additional patents issued to third parties of which we are presently unaware that may relate to aspects of our technology that such third parties could assert against us and materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be patent applications that are currently pending and unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that third parties could assert against us and materially and adversely affect our business.
 
Any adverse determination in litigations, post grant trial proceedings, including interference proceedings, at the Patent Office relating to intellectual property to which we are or may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties, and result in the cancellation and/or invalidation of our intellectual property. Furthermore, if a court finds that we have willfully infringed a third party’s intellectual property, we could be required to pay treble damages and/or attorney fees for the prevailing party, in addition to other penalties. Although intellectual property disputes in the medical device area are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements can be substantial and often require ongoing royalty payments. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we do not obtain necessary licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement; if we are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement, we may not receive FDA approval in a timely manner. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business.
 
Trademarks
 
We have one pending U.S. trademark application for the “NeuroOneTM” trademark. We were issued a notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in December 2017, and on June 11, 2019, we received an approval of our extension request.
 
17

 

Trade Secrets
 
We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect such intellectual property and proprietary information by generally requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement as the case may be.

Government Regulation
 
Our cortical strip, grid and depth electrodes are a medical device subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA, the U.S. CMS, the European Commission, and regulatory bodies in other countries. Regulations cover virtually every critical aspect of a medical device company’s business operations, including research activities, product development, quality and risk management, contracting, reimbursement, medical communications, and sales and marketing. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and the implementing regulations of the FDA govern product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, product manufacturing, quality systems, import and export, product labeling, product storage, recalls and field safety corrective actions, advertising and promotion, product sales and distribution, and post-market clinical surveillance. Our business is subject to federal, state, local, and foreign regulations, such as ISO 13485, ISO 14971, FDA’s QSR contained in 21 CFR Part 820, and the European Commission’s Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices and its amendments.
Regulatory Framework in the United States
 
Device classification
 
The FDA characterizes medical devices into one of three classes. Devices that are considered by the FDA to pose lower risk are classified as Class I or II. Class I devices are subject to controls for labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to the FDA’s QSR. This pertains to manufacturers’ methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of products, but are usually exempt from premarket notification requirements. Class II devices are subject to the same general controls but may be subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling, and may also require clinical testing prior to clearance or approval. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, including devices that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
 
Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the pre-market notification requirement under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, and the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. However, a pre-market approval (“PMA application”), is required for devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or certain implantable devices, or those that are “not substantially equivalent” either to a device previously cleared through the 510(k) process or to a “preamendment” Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 when PMA applications were not required. The PMA approval process is more comprehensive than the 510(k) clearance process and typically takes several years to complete. Based on FDA definitions, we believe our diagnostic strip, grid and depth electrode technology will be categorized by the FDA as a Class II device that does not require clinical testing and can be filed as a 510(k), similar to existing competitive technology. The Company expects that indications for treating epilepsy, Parkinson’s and other patients suffering from motor related neurological deficiencies via a permanent implant for chronic treatment will require a PMA process to commercially distribute in the United States.

The 510(k) clearance process
 
Under the 510(k) clearance process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to a PMA, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 
After a 510(k) premarket notification is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
 
If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. The de novo classification process is an alternate pathway to classify medical devices that are automatically classified into Class III but which are low to moderate risk. A manufacturer can submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk. De novo classification may also be available after receipt of a “not substantially equivalent” letter following submission of a 510(k) to FDA.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires a new submission in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacture documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for such change. The FDA can always review these letters to file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing 510(k)-cleared device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. In addition, in these circumstances, the FDA can impose significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite application(s).
 
The PMA approval process
 
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA.
 
Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
19

 

Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct inspections of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, as well as inspections of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
 

● | the device may not be safe, effective, reliable or accurate to the FDA’s satisfaction; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If an FDA evaluation of a PMA application is favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter, or approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of a device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.
 
New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE, to the FDA. The Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. The FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. Clinical trials must be entered into the clinical trials registry at clinicaltrials.gov. 
 
The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
 

● | the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
20

 


● | patients, sponsor (NeuroOne) or study sites do not comply with trial protocols; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | patient follow-up is not at the rate expected; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | patients experience adverse side effects; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of our trial; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or other FDA requirements; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the sponsor (NeuroOne) or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to the sponsor (NeuroOne) or the study that the FDA deems to make the study results unreliable, or the company or investigators fail to disclose such interests; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA concludes that our trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

International Regulation
 
International sales of medical devices are subject to local government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries.
 
The primary regulatory body in Europe is that of the European Union, the European Commission, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of these relevant directives will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a “Notified Body.” This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union. Additional local requirements may apply on a country-by-country basis. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval would need to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our products.
 
21

 

Medical devices in Europe are classified into four primary categories. They are as follows:
 

● | Non-invasive devices; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | Invasive medical devices; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Active medical devices; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Special Rules (including contraceptive, disinfectant, and radiological diagnostic medical devices). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Devices are further segmented into the classes noted below. In vitro diagnostic devices have their own classification scheme and while active implantable devices do not follow the same classification system as provided by the Medical Devices Directive, they are subject to similar requirements as Class III devices:
 

● | Class I – Provided non-sterile or do not have a measuring function (low risk); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class I – Provided sterile and/or have a measuring function (low/medium risk); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class IIa (medium risk); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class IIb (medium/high risk); and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class III (high risk). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
After a review of our technology, an international regulatory consultant advised us that our strip, grid and depth electrode diagnostic technology is likely a Class III device (since it comes into contact with the central nervous system) which will require a lengthy approval process as a design dossier including clinical data will be required for approval.
 
Other Regulatory Requirements
 
Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
 

● | establishment registration and device listing; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, risk management, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations that prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotion; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | MDR regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and could be a risk to health; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
22

 

Also, the FDA may require us to conduct post-market surveillance studies or establish and maintain a system for tracking our products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA enforces regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. These may include any of the following sanctions or consequences:
 

● | warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines and civil penalties; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | unanticipated expenditures; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delays in approving or refusal to approve future products; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | suspension or withdrawal of FDA clearance or approval; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product recall or seizure; interruption of production; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our contract manufacturers, specification developers and some suppliers of components or device accessories, also are required to manufacture our products in compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes that any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down such manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and Similar Foreign and State Laws and Regulations Affecting the Transmission, Security and Privacy of Health Information
  
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as service providers of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from HIPAA and each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.
 
23

 

Foreign data privacy regulations, such as the EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC), the country-specific regulations that implement Directive 95/46/EC, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation also govern the processing of personally identifiable data, and may be stricter than U.S. laws.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
In addition to FDA restrictions, there are numerous U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Our relationships with healthcare providers and other third parties are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs.
 
Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”) prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a review of all its relevant facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of (or purchases, or recommendations related to) federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been implicated and potentially violated.
 
The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $25,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which do not have the same exceptions and apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Further, the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). Specifically, as noted above, under the Anti-Kickback Statute, the government must prove the defendant acted “knowingly” to prove a violation occurred. The ACA added a provision to clarify that with respect to violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute, “a person need not have actual knowledge” of the statute or specific intent to commit a violation of the statute. This change effectively overturns case law interpretations that set a higher standard under which prosecutors had to prove the specific intent to violate the law. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”).
 
We plan to provide the initial training to providers and patients necessary for appropriate use of our technology either through our own educators or by contracting with outside educators that have completed an appropriate training course. Outside educators are reimbursed for their services at fair market value.
 
Noncompliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute could result in our exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and civil and criminal penalties.
 
24

 

The federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits a physician from ordering “designated health services,” including durable medical equipment, for Medicare and Medicaid patients from entities with which the physician (or an immediate family member) has a “financial relationship.” Financial relationships include both compensation arrangements and investment and ownership interests. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. We believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply with current Stark Law requirements.
 
Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
 
Additionally, as some of these laws are still evolving, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final form that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider and training arrangements may ultimately be found to be not in compliance with applicable federal law.
 
False Claims Act
 
The False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against companies under the False Claims Act. Penalties include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.
 
There are other federal anti-fraud laws that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
Additionally, HIPAA established two federal crimes related to making false statements in relation to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. 
 
Civil Monetary Penalties Law
 
In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, the federal government has the authority to seek civil monetary penalties, or CMPs, assessments, and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a wide variety of prohibited conduct. For example, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the imposition of substantial CMPs against an entity that engages in activities including, but not limited to: (1) knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, a claim for services not provided as claimed or which is otherwise false or fraudulent in any way; (2) knowingly giving or causing to be given false or misleading information reasonably expected to influence the decision to discharge a patient; (3) offering or giving remuneration to any beneficiary of a federal health care program likely to influence the receipt of reimbursable items or services; (4) arranging for reimbursable services with an entity which is excluded from participation from a federal health care program; (5) knowingly or willfully soliciting or receiving remuneration for a referral of a federal health care program beneficiary; or (6) using a payment intended for a federal health care program beneficiary for another use. The government is authorized to seek different amounts of CMPs and assessments based on underlying violation. For false or fraudulent claims, the government may seek a penalty of up to $10,000 for each item or service improperly claimed, and an assessment of up to three times the amount improperly claimed. For kickback violations, the government may seek a penalty of up to $50,000 for each improper act and damages of up to three times the amount of remuneration at issue.
 
25

 

State Fraud and Abuse Provisions
 
Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and a false claims act. We believe that we are in conformance to such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Physician Payment Sunshine Act
 
Transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers and teaching hospitals may also impact our business practices. The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires most medical device manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of Human Health Services financial arrangements, payments, or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. The payment information is made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Over the next several years, we will need to dedicate significant resources to establish and maintain systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties. Similar laws have been enacted or are under consideration in foreign jurisdictions.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”)
 
The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making corrupt payments, gifts or transfers to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2019, we had four employees, all of whom are full-time, and all of whom are located in the United States, and we also retained the services of approximately 11 regular consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
