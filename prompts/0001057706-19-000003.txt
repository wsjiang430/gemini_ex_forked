Item 1. Business 
GENERAL
 
First BanCorp. is a publicly owned financial holding company that is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by Federal Reserve Board.  The Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to serve as the bank holding company for FirstBank. The Corporation is a full service provider of financial services and products with operations in Puerto Rico, the U.S., the USVI and the BVI. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had total assets of $12.2 billion, total deposits of $9.0 billion, and total stockholders’ equity of $2.0 billion.
 
The Corporation provides a wide range of financial services for retail, commercial and institutional clients. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation controlled two wholly-owned subsidiaries: FirstBank and FirstBank Insurance Agency, Inc. (“FirstBank Insurance Agency”). FirstBank is a Puerto Rico-chartered commercial bank, and FirstBank Insurance Agency is a Puerto Rico-chartered insurance agency. 
 
FirstBank is subject to the supervision, examination and regulation of both the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico (“OCIF”) and the FDIC.  Deposits are insured through the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund. In addition, within FirstBank, the Bank’s USVI operations are subject to regulation and examination by the United States Virgin Islands Banking Board; its BVI operations are subject to regulation by the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission; and its operations in the state of Florida are subject to regulation and examination by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) regulates FirstBank’s consumer financial products and services.  FirstBank Insurance Agency is subject to the supervision, examination and regulation of the Office of the Insurance Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and operates four offices in Puerto Rico, and two offices in the USVI and the BVI.
 
As of December 31, 2018, FirstBank conducts its business through its main office located in San Juan, Puerto Rico, 46 banking branches in Puerto Rico, 11 banking branches in the USVI and the BVI, and 10 banking branches in the state of Florida (USA). As of December 31, 2018, FirstBank has 6 wholly owned subsidiaries with operations in Puerto Rico: First Federal Finance Corp. (d/b/a Money Express La Financiera), a finance company specializing in the origination of small loans with 28 offices in Puerto Rico; First Management of Puerto Rico, a domestic corporation, which holds tax-exempt assets; FirstBank Puerto Rico Securities, Corp. (“FirstBank Securities”), a subsidiary formerly engaged in broker-dealer activities; FirstBank Overseas Corporation, an international banking entity organized under the International Banking Entity Act of Puerto Rico; and two other companies that hold and operate certain other real estate owned (“OREO”) properties. On August 1, 2018, the Bank’s Board of Directors approved a resolution to dissolve the broker-dealer subsidiary FirstBank Securities. Accordingly, FirstBank Securities filed the required Form BDW for the withdrawal of its registration from the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and its license to operate as broker-dealer was terminated effective September 30, 2018. Management is in the process of completing the dissolution of FirstBank Securities as a legal entity under the state laws.
 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
 
The Corporation has six reportable segments: Commercial and Corporate Banking; Consumer (Retail) Banking; Mortgage Banking; Treasury and Investments; United States Operations; and Virgin Islands Operations. These segments are described below as well as in Note 35, “Segment Information,” to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 
  
 5
  
Commercial and Corporate Banking
 
The Commercial and Corporate Banking segment consists of the Corporation’s lending and other services for large customers represented by specialized and middle-market clients and the public sector in Puerto Rico. FirstBank has developed expertise in a wide variety of industries. The Commercial and Corporate Banking segment offers commercial loans, including commercial real estate and construction loans, and floor plan financings, as well as other products, such as cash management and business management services. A substantial portion of the commercial and corporate banking portfolio is secured by the underlying value of the real estate collateral and the personal guarantees of the borrowers.  This segment also includes the Corporation’s broker-dealer activities. 
Consumer (Retail) Banking
 
The Consumer (Retail) Banking segment consists of the Corporation’s consumer lending and deposit-taking activities conducted mainly through FirstBank’s branch network in Puerto Rico. Loans to consumers include auto, boat and personal loans, credit cards, and lines of credit.  Deposit products include interest-bearing and non-interest bearing checking and savings accounts, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA) and retail certificates of deposit (“retail CDs”). Retail deposits gathered through each branch of FirstBank’s retail network serve as one of the funding sources for the lending and investment activities. Other activities included in this operating segment are finance leases and insurance agency activities in Puerto Rico.
Mortgage Banking
 
These operations consist of the origination, sale, and servicing of a variety of residential mortgage loan products and related hedging activities in Puerto Rico. Originations are sourced through different channels, such as FirstBank branches and purchases from mortgage bankers, and in association with new project developers.  The Mortgage Banking segment focuses on originating residential real estate loans, some of which conform to Federal Housing Administration (the “FHA”), Veterans Administration (the “VA”) and Rural Development (the “RD”) standards. Loans originated that meet the FHA’s standards qualify for the FHA’s insurance program whereas loans that meet the standards of the VA and RD are guaranteed by those respective federal agencies. 
 
Mortgage loans that do not qualify under these programs are commonly referred to as conventional loans. Conventional real estate loans can be conforming or non-conforming. Conforming loans are residential real estate loans that meet the standards for sale under the Fannie Mae (“FNMA”) and Freddie Mac (“FHLMC”) programs whereas loans that do not meet those standards are referred to as non-conforming residential real estate loans. The Corporation’s strategy is to penetrate markets by providing customers with a variety of high quality mortgage products to serve their financial needs through a faster and simpler process and at competitive prices.  The Mortgage Banking segment also acquires and sells mortgages in the secondary markets. Residential real estate conforming loans are sold to investors like FNMA and FHLMC. Most of the Corporation’s residential mortgage loan portfolio consists of fixed-rate, fully amortizing, full documentation loans. The Corporation has commitment authority to issue Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) mortgage-backed securities. Under this program, the Corporation has been selling FHA/VA mortgage loans into the secondary market since 2009.
 
Treasury and Investments
 
The Treasury and Investments segment is responsible for the Corporation’s treasury and investment management functions. The treasury function, which includes funding and liquidity management, lends funds to the Commercial and Corporate Banking, Mortgage Banking, and the Consumer (Retail) Banking segments to finance their respective lending activities and borrows from those segments. Funds not gathered by the different business units are obtained by the Treasury function through wholesale channels, such as brokered deposits, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”), and repurchase agreements involving investment securities, among others.
 
  
 6
  
United States Operations
 
The United States Operations segment consists of all banking activities conducted by FirstBank on the U.S. mainland. FirstBank provides a wide range of banking services to individual and corporate customers, primarily in southern Florida through 10 banking branches. The United States Operations segment offers an array of both consumer and commercial banking products and services. Consumer banking products include checking, savings and money market accounts, retail CDs, internet banking services, residential mortgages, home equity loans, lines of credit, and automobile loans. Retail deposits, as well as FHLB advances and brokered CDs assigned to this operation, serve as funding sources for its lending activities. Deposits gathered through FirstBank’s branches in the U.S. also serve as one of the funding sources for lending and investment activities in Puerto Rico.
 
The commercial banking services include checking, savings and money market accounts, retail CDs, internet banking services, cash management services, remote data capture, and automated clearing house, or ACH, transactions.  Loan products include the traditional commercial and industrial and commercial real estate products, such as lines of credit, term loans and construction loans.  
 
Virgin Islands Operations
 
The Virgin Islands Operations segment consists of all banking activities conducted by FirstBank in the USVI and the BVI, including retail and commercial banking services, with a total of 11 banking branches serving the islands in the USVI of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John, and the island of Tortola in the BVI. The Virgin Islands Operations segment is driven by its consumer, commercial lending and deposit-taking activities.  
 
Loans to consumers include auto, boat, lines of credit, and personal and residential mortgage loans.  Deposit products include interest-bearing and non-interest bearing checking and savings accounts, IRAs, and retail CDs.  Retail deposits gathered through each branch serve as the funding sources for its own lending activities.
 
Employees
 
As of February 1, 2019, the Corporation and its subsidiaries had 2,643 full-time equivalent employees. None of its employees is represented by a collective bargaining group. The Corporation considers its employee relations to be good.
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2018
 
Continuing effects of natural disasters affecting First BanCorp.
 
Two strong hurricanes affected the Corporation’s service areas during September 2017. The following summarizes the more significant continuing financial repercussions of these natural disasters for the Corporation and for its major subsidiary, FirstBank.
Credit Quality and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
 Relationship officers have continued to closely monitor the performance of hurricane-affected commercial loan customers during 2018. Information provided by these commercial loan officers and statistics on the performance of consumer and residential credits were factored into the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses as of December 31, 2018. Although the identification and evaluation of hurricane-affected credits has been completed, management’s assessment of the hurricanes’ effect is still subject to uncertainties, both those specific to some individual customers, such as the resolution of insurance claims, and those applicable to the overall economic prospects of the hurricane-affected areas as a whole. During 2018, the Corporation recorded a net loan loss reserve release of approximately $16.9 million in connection with revised estimates associated with the effects of the hurricanes. The revised estimates were primarily attributable to updated assessments of financial performance and repayment prospects of certain individually-assessed commercial credits, updated payment patterns and probability of default credit risk analyses applied to consumer borrowers, and lower reserve requirements resulting from payments received during 2018 that reduced the balance of the consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios outstanding on the dates of the hurricanes.   In addition, during 2018, consumer loan charge-offs totaling $10.9 million were taken against previously established hurricane-related qualitative reserves. These charge offs were directly linked to the performance of consumer borrowers that were subject to payment deferral programs.

  
 7
  
As of December 31, 2018, the hurricane-related qualitative allowance amounted to $19.2 million (December 31, 2017 - $55.6 million). The Corporation’s approach to estimating the hurricanes’ impact on credit quality is presented in Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,” to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  

Disaster Response Plan Costs, Casualty Losses and Related Insurance
 The Corporation has incurred a variety of costs to operate in disaster response mode, and some facilities and their contents, including certain OREO properties, were damaged by the storms.  The Corporation maintains insurance for casualty losses, as well as for reasonable and necessary disaster response costs and certain revenue lost through business interruption. Insurance claim receivables were established for some of the individual costs, when incurred, based on management’s understanding of the underlying coverage and when realization of the claim was deemed probable. During 2018, the Corporation reached settlement on certain insurance claims arising from the hurricanes. As a result, the Corporation received insurance proceeds of approximately $6.8 million, primarily related to repairs and maintenance costs incurred on some facilities, including certain OREO properties, $1.0 million related to recoveries of disaster response costs, and $0.8 million related to a loan receivable fully charged-off in prior periods. Recoveries from insurance proceeds in excess of losses incurred, amounting to $0.5 million for 2018, were recognized as a gain from insurance proceeds. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation still had an insurance claim receivable of $3.4 million. Management also believes that there is a possibility that some gains will be recognized with respect to casualty and lost revenue claims in future periods, but this is contingent on reaching agreement on the Corporation’s claims with the insurance carriers.
Liquidity Management
 The Corporation experienced rapid accumulation of deposits after the hurricanes in the fourth quarter of 2017 and during 2018. Total deposits as of December 31, 2018, excluding brokered CDs, increased $567.0 million from December 31, 2017 and $928.5 million since September 30, 2017.  The most significant increase was in non-interest-bearing demand deposits, which grew 31%, or $561.8 million, from December 31, 2017 and 51%, or $809.3 million, since September 30, 2017.  Hurricane-related factors, such as the effect of disaster relief funds and settlements of insurance claims, contributed to this growth.  Although management expects the balances accumulated by deposit customers in the hurricane-affected areas to reduce over time, it is difficult to predict when and to what degree, and there may be further growth as insurance claims are resolved and additional disaster-recovery funds are distributed.
 
Repurchase of Trust-Preferred Securities 
 
During the first quarter of 2018, the Corporation completed the repurchase of $23.8 million of trust-preferred securities of the FBP Statutory Trust I that were auctioned in a public sale at which the Corporation was invited to participate. The Corporation repurchased and cancelled the repurchased trust-preferred securities, which resulted in a commensurate reduction in the related Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debenture. The Corporation’s winning bid equated to 90% of the $23.8 million par value. The 10% discount resulted in a gain of approximately $2.3 million, which is reflected in the consolidated statement of income as a “Gain on early extinguishment of debt.”
 
Transfer of Nonaccrual Loans Held for Investment to Held for Sale and Sales of Nonaccrual Loans
 
  During the first and third quarters 2018, the Corporation transferred $74.4 million in nonaccrual commercial and construction loans to held for sale. The aggregate recorded investment in these loans of $96.6 million was written down to $74.4 million, which resulted in charge-offs of $22.2 million, of which $6.5 million was taken against previously-established reserves for loan losses, resulting in a charge to the provision for loan and lease losses of $15.7 million in 2018.  Approximately $57.2 million of the nonaccrual commercial and construction loans transferred to loans held for sale were eventually sold during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2018, resulting in an additional net loss of $2.7 million recorded as part of “other non-interest income” in the consolidated statement of income.

U.S. Department of Treasury exercised warrant
 
On May 17, 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”) exercised its warrant to purchase 1,285,899 shares of the Corporation’s common stock on a cashless basis, resulting in the issuance of 730,571 shares of common stock.
 
Reinstatement of quarterly cash common stock dividends
 
On November 14, 2018, for the first time since June 2009, the Corporation’s Board of Directors, after receiving regulatory approval, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per common share, which was paid on December 14, 2018, to common stockholders of record on November 30, 2018. Total cash dividends paid on shares of common stock amounted to $6.5 million for 2018 (or a dividend payout ratio per share of 6.46% for the fourth quarter of 2018). The Corporation has received regulatory approval to pay quarterly dividends on common stock through December 2019, subject to conditions established in the agreement with regulators. Thereafter, the Corporation intends to request approval in future periods to continue quarterly dividend payments on common stock.
 
Partial Reversal of Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance
 
The Corporation recognized an income tax benefit of $63.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to the partial reversal of the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets of its bank subsidiary, FirstBank.  The Corporation concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, it is more likely than not that FirstBank will generate sufficient taxable income within the applicable net operating loss carry-forward periods to partially realize its deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) in Puerto Rico.
 
This conclusion, and the resulting partial reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, is based upon consideration of a number of factors, including, among others,: (i) a three-year cumulative income position; (ii) sustained periods of profitability following the hurricane events in 2017; and (iii) forecasts of future profitability, under several potential scenarios that support the partial utilization of NOLs prior to their expiration between 2021 through 2024.  As a result of the partial reversal, the Corporation’s deferred tax asset amounted to $319.9 million as of December 31, 2018 (net of a valuation allowance of $100.7 million, including a valuation allowance of $68.1 million against the deferred tax assets of the Corporation’s banking subsidiary, FirstBank).  See Note 26, “Income Taxes,” in Item 8 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a detailed discussion on the Corporation’s deferred tax assets and the respective valuation allowance. 
 
Puerto Rico Government Fiscal Situation, Government Actions, and the Corporation’s exposure to the Puerto Rico Government
 
A significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which has been in an economic recession since 2006 that has been exacerbated by the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017.  The New Fiscal Plan approved by the PROMESA oversight board, as revised on October 23, 2018 (the “New Fiscal Plan”), projects a contraction in Puerto Rico’s gross national product of 8.0% for fiscal year 2018, followed by projected growths of 7.9% and 5.5% for fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively. Such projected growth was based on an assumption that over $82 billion of disaster relief funding will enter the economy of Puerto Rico from federal and private sources. Of the total disaster relief funding of $82 billion, estimated amounts of approximately $66 billion are to be used for public assistance, $3 billion for individual assistance, $8 billion for private and business insurance pay outs, and $5 billion is related to other federal funding. On July 30, 2018, HUD approved a $1.5 billion disaster recovery plan submitted by the Puerto Rico government that primarily focuses on the restoration of damaged and destroyed homes, businesses and infrastructure.  The disaster recovery action plan includes the following activities: (i) housing ($1 billion) – for rebuilding and repairs of damaged properties, rental assistance, and appliances; (ii) economic revitalization ($145 million) – for eligible businesses to help-revitalize the post-disaster economy, including through grants; and (iii) infrastructure ($100 million) – for repairs of the damaged infrastructure in Puerto Rico. In February 2019, the Puerto Rico governor announced that HUD authorized the disbursement and use of funds approved through the aforementioned disaster recovery plan.

The Puerto Rico Economic Activity Index (the “EDB-EAI”) in November 2018 was 120.3, close to pre-hurricane levels of 122.1 in August 2017, and a 21.5% growth compared to post-hurricane levels of 99.0 in November 2017, mainly related to interruption of the electric energy system in 2017 due to hurricanes Irma and Maria. The EDB-EAI is a coincident index of economic activity for Puerto Rico made up of four indicators (non-farm payroll employment, electric power generation, cement sales and gasoline consumption). The cement sales for November 2018 totaled 1.2 million of 94-pound bags, an increase of 6.3% over the prior month, and an annual increase of 64.3%. Estimated gasoline consumption in November 2018 was 78.1 million gallons, a 2.8% decrease when compared with October 2018, and a decrease of 6.7% compared to the same period in 2017.  Electric power generation for November 2018 totaled 1,532.5 million kilowatt-hours, an increase of 3.3% over the prior month, and an annual increase of 94.7% compared with the same period in 2017. The revised version of the New Fiscal Plan projects that the hurricanes will create a spike in inflation of 1.6% in fiscal year 2018, with subsequent average increases of about 1.49% over the next six years, until fiscal year 2023.  The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Puerto Rico was 8.3% in December 2018, compared to 11.0% in December 2017.  The Puerto Rico labor force participation rate was 40.8% as of December 2018.  The average of the labor force participation rate in Puerto Rico was 45.05% from 1990 until 2017, reaching an all-time high of 49.80% in February of 2007 and a record low of 38.6% in October of 2017.  Based on information published by the Puerto Rico government, the labor force estimate was 1.1 million people as of December 2018, a reduction of 1.4% when compared with December 2017. The New Fiscal Plan reflects a 5.5% decline in population by fiscal year 2023.  
 
 Based on information published by the Puerto Rico Treasury, the net revenues of the Puerto Rico government’s General Fund in November 2018 totaled $556.9 million, which was $16.8 million less than in November 2017, and $25.5 million over projections of the New Fiscal Plan.  The net revenue to the General Fund for the first five months of fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 totaled $3,540.2 million, an increase of $611.8 million, compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year.
 
Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico Liquidation Plan
 
On July 14, 2017, the PROMESA oversight board authorized the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico (the “GDB”) to pursue the restructuring of its debts under Title VI of PROMESA and conditionally certified the GDB’s Restructuring Support Agreement (“RSA”) under the relevant provisions of Title VI.  The PROMESA oversight board’s decision was in response to a request from Puerto Rico’s Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, dated June 30, 2017, in which the agency noted that the proposed restructuring, along with certain related settlements contemplated by the RSA, will result in an efficient wind down of the GDB’s operations and a comprehensive financial restructuring of the GDB’s obligations. The RSA provides for the organized and consensual restructuring of a substantial portion of the GDB’s liabilities, including the GDB public bonds, deposit claims by municipalities and certain non-public entities, and claims under certain GDB-issued letters of credit and guarantees. In exchange for releasing the GDB from liability relating to these claims, the claim-holders will receive new bonds to be issued by a new entity.
 
On April 20, 2018, the PROMESA oversight board approved the new GDB fiscal plan. The new GDB fiscal plan authorizes the recently amended terms of RSA. It also paves the way for the GDB’s operational wind-down, provides for a simplified transaction structure, and ensures equal treatment of creditors. It also offers municipalities offset rights against their deposit claims. 
 
New Fiscal Plan
 
The New Fiscal Plan approved by the PROMESA oversight board, uses a six-year horizon and projects a 5.5% decline in population by fiscal year 2023.  In addition, the revised New Fiscal Plan established an annual emergency reserve of $130 million for 10 years. As mentioned above, it also assumes $82 billion in disaster relief funding and projects that a $30 billion surplus will be generated through fiscal year 2033. The New Fiscal Plan includes a series of structural reforms in areas, such as: (i) human capital and labor; (ii) ease of doing business; (iii) power sector reform; and (iv) infrastructure reform.  The New Fiscal Plan also proposes fiscal measures projected to drive $12.4 billion in increased revenues and reduced expenditures through fiscal year 2023 and projects that structural reforms will drive a cumulative 1.21% increase in growth by Fiscal year 2058.

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Budget
 
On May 10, 2018, the Puerto Rico governor proposed the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico’s budget for fiscal year 2018-2019. The proposed consolidated budget amounts to $25.3 billion and comes from the following sources:
 
·   $8.7 billion from General Fund
 ·   $8.1 billion from Federal Funds
 ·   $7.5 billion from Revenue Funds
 ·   $0.4 billion from Special State Funds
 ·   $0.6 billion from Other Governmental Funds
 The recommended General Fund budget amounted to $8.7 billion, a net decrease of $0.8 billion when compared with the budget approved for the fiscal year 2017-2018. On the other hand, the Federal Funds budgeted amount in the proposed budget shows an increase of $1.8 billion or 28% more compared with the budget for fiscal year 2017-2018. However, the PROMESA oversight board concluded that the proposed Commonwealth of Puerto Rico budget for fiscal year 2018-2019 does not comply with the Fiscal Plan approved on April 19, 2018.   On June 29, 2018, the PROMESA oversight board stated that, because of the Puerto Rico government’s failure to enact labor reform, including the repeal of the law on unjustified work dismissals ( Law 80), it had certified a new revised version of the New Fiscal Plan that reflects, among others changes, a reduction of the projected 30-year surplus of the central government to $14.4 billion from the previous projection between $39 billion to $40 billion, the elimination of Christmas bonuses for public employees, and lower funding for infrastructure and municipalities.
 
On June 30, 2018, the PROMESA oversight board certified a revised budget for fiscal year 2019 that outlines expenditures of $8.8 billion from the General Fund and $20.7 billion from the consolidated budget.
 
On July 5, 2018, the Puerto Rico government filed a lawsuit seeking declaratory judgment that clarifies the PROMESA oversight board’s power over the Commonwealth’s budget.
 
On August 7, 2018, the U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled that the PROMESA oversight board has the power to enforce fiscal discipline through the budgetary process, but lacks authority to demand changes in laws.
 
Puerto Rico Tax Reform of 2018 – Law Act 257
 
On December 10, 2018, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into Law Act 257 (the “Puerto Rico Tax Reform of 2018” or “Act 257”), which amends numerous provisions of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 2011, including, among others, (i) a reduction in the Puerto Rico corporate tax rate from 39% to 37.5%; (ii) an increase in the net operating and capital losses usage limitation from 80% to 90%; (iii) amendments to the provisions related to “pass-through” entities that provide that corporations that own 50% or more of a partnership will not be able to claim a current or carryover non partnership NOL deduction against a partnership distributable share, and (iv) other limitations on certain deductions such as meals and entertainment deductions.  As a result of the enactment of Act 257, the Corporation recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 a one-time charge to income tax expense of $9.9 million related to the remeasurement of the Corporation’s deferred tax assets arising from the aforementioned decrease in the maximum statutory tax rate in Puerto Rico from 39% to 37.5% (net of the $5.6 million related impact in the valuation allowance). The PROMESA oversight board expressed concerns regarding certain provisions of Act 257. In particular, the PROMESA oversight board indicated that it has not received enough evidence from the Puerto Rico government to conclude that Act 257 will not negatively impact the Puerto Rico government’s fiscal Plan. It has not yet been determined whether Act 257 will be further amended to accommodate any mandate from the PROMESA oversight board.   The PROMESA oversight board issued a letter to the Governor of Puerto Rico on December 27, 2018 stating that Act 257 is not in compliance with PROMESA with respect to Articles 132 through 163, regarding the video lottery terminals (VLTs) that operate outside casinos in Puerto Rico.

The Third Amended Title III Plan of Adjustment (the “COFINA plan”)
 
On February 4, 2019, the U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, approved the COFINA plan, a restructuring agreement for bondholders of debt issued by the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (“COFINA,” by its Spanish acronym). The COFINA plan restructures $18.0 billion of COFINA debt, which represents 24% of Puerto Rico’s funded debt. In addition, the COFINA plan reduced the annual cash flow to COFINA from a maximum of $1.8 billion to $992 million and provides to the Government of Puerto Rico an average annual savings of $425 million for the next 40 years.
 
Recent Developments
 
On February 15, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that members of the PROMESA oversight board created by PROMESA are “Officers of the Unites States” subject to the U.S. Constitution’s Appointments Clause and directed the district court to enter a declaratory judgement to the effect that PROMESA’s protocol for the appointment of Board Members is unconstitutional.
 
This matter arose from the restructuring of Puerto Rico’s public debt under PROMESA. In May 2017, the PROMESA oversight board exercised its authority under Title III of PROMESA to initiate debt adjustment proceedings on behalf of the Puerto Rico government. Appellants sought to dismiss the Title III proceedings, arguing that the PROMESA oversight board lacked authority to initiate them because the PROMESA oversight board members were illegally appointed in contravention of the Appointments Clause. The district court rejected Appellants’ motions to dismiss. The First Circuit reversed in part, (1) the Territorial Clause does not displace the Appointments Clause in an unincorporated territory such as Puerto Rico; (2) Board Members are “Principal” “Officers of the United States” subject to the Appointments Clause; and (3) therefore, the process PROMESA provides for the appointment of Board Members is unconstitutional.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit set a 90-day period to allow President Donald Trump and the U.S. Senate to constitutionally validate the appointments or reconstitute the PROMESA oversight board.
 
On February 22, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’ complaint against the PROMESA oversight board and its members and executive director alleging that the PROMESA oversight board had exceeded its power under PROMESA during the 2019 fiscal plan and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico’s budget development and certification processes, holding that the complaint was properly dismissed.
 
Exposure to the Puerto Rico Government
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $214.6 million of direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its municipalities and public corporations, compared to $214.5 million as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $191.9 million of the exposure consisted of loans and obligations of municipalities in Puerto Rico that are supported by assigned property tax revenues and for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality have been pledged to their repayment, compared to $184.6 million as of December 31, 2017.  Approximately 75% of the Corporation’s municipality exposure consisted primarily of senior priority obligations concentrated in three of the largest municipalities in Puerto Rico. These municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as are required for the payment of all of their respective general obligation bonds and notes. The PROMESA oversight board has not designated any of the Commonwealth’s 78 municipalities as covered entities under PROMESA.  However, while the revised fiscal plan certified by the PROMESA oversight board did not contemplate a restructuring of the debt of Puerto Rico’s municipalities, the plan did call for the gradual elimination of budgetary subsidies provided to municipalities. Furthermore, municipalities are also likely to be affected by the negative economic and other effects resulting from expense, revenue or cash management measures taken to address the Puerto Rico government’s fiscal and liquidity shortfalls, as well as measures included in fiscal plans of other government entities.  In addition to municipalities, the Corporation’s total direct exposure included a $14.5 million loan to an affiliate of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (“PREPA”) and obligations of the Puerto Rico government, specifically bonds of the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority, at an amortized cost of $8.2 million as part of its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio (fair value of $7.0 million as of December 31, 2018).

In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $112.1 million in exposure to residential mortgage loans that are guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority. Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority are secured by the underlying properties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. The Puerto Rico government guarantees up to $75 million of the principal under the mortgage loan insurance program. According to the most recently-released audited financial statements of the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority, as of June 30, 2016, the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority’s mortgage loans insurance program covered loans in an aggregate of approximately $576 million. The regulations adopted by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority require the establishment of adequate reserves to guarantee the solvency of the mortgage loan insurance fund. As of June 30, 2016, the most recent date as to which information is available, the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority had a restricted net position for such purposes of approximately $77.4 million. 
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $677.3 million of public sector deposits in Puerto Rico, compared to $490.3 million as of December 31, 2017. Approximately 34% is from municipalities and municipal agencies in Puerto Rico and 66% is from public corporations and the central government and agencies in Puerto Rico.
 
During 2018, the Corporation reached resolution on the three commercial mortgage loans granted to the hotel industry in Puerto Rico that were formerly guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Tourism Development Fund (“TDF”).   Historically, the borrower and the operations of the underlying collateral of these loans were the primary sources of repayment and the TDF, which is a subsidiary of the GDB, provided a secondary guarantee for payment performance.  The Corporation sold in 2018 two of these three loans that carried an aggregate book value of $27.2 million (net of cumulative charge-offs of $22.0 million), realizing an additional loss of $2.7 million at the time of sale. In addition, the largest of these three facilities was paid-off during the fourth quarter of 2018. This facility carried a book value of $28.8 million (net of cumulative charge-offs of $28.4 million) and a loan loss recovery of $7.4 million was recorded at the time of the repayment in 2018.  The sales and repayments of such loans resulted in a $70.8 million reduction in nonaccrual loans during 2018.

MARKET AREA AND COMPETITION
 Puerto Rico, where the banking market is highly competitive, is the main geographic service area of the Corporation. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation also had a presence in the state of Florida and in the USVI and the BVI. Puerto Rico banks are subject to the same federal laws, regulations and supervision that apply to similar institutions in the United States mainland.
 
Competitors include other banks, insurance companies, mortgage banking companies, small loan companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, brokerage firms with retail operations, and credit unions in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the state of Florida. The Corporation’s businesses compete with these other firms with respect to the range of products and services offered and the types of clients, customers and industries served.
 
The Corporation’s ability to compete effectively depends on the relative performance of its products, the degree to which the features of its products appeal to customers, and the extent to which the Corporation meets clients’ needs and expectations. The Corporation’s ability to compete also depends on its ability to attract and retain professional and other personnel, and on its reputation.
 
The Corporation encounters intense competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in its consumer and commercial lending activities. The Corporation competes for loans with other financial institutions, some of which are larger and have greater resources available than those of the Corporation. Management believes that the Corporation has been able to compete effectively for deposits and loans by offering a variety of account products and loans with competitive features, by pricing its products at competitive interest rates, by offering convenient branch locations, and by emphasizing the quality of its service. The Corporation’s ability to originate loans depends primarily on the rates and fees charged and the service it provides to its borrowers in making prompt credit decisions. There can be no assurance that in the future the Corporation will be able to continue to increase its deposit base or originate loans in the manner or on the terms on which it has done so in the past.
 
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
Most of the regulations required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) now have been adopted. Although there is a possibility of additional Dodd-Frank Act-related regulations in the future, the pace of new regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act is expected to abate. Future legislation, however, may increase the regulation and oversight of the Corporation and FirstBank, although it is also possible that future legislation could reduce the regulatory compliance obligations of FirstBank and the Corporation. Any change in applicable laws or regulations, however, may have a material adverse effect on the business of commercial banks and bank holding companies, including FirstBank and the Corporation. 
 Dodd-Frank Act
 The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry.  The Dodd-Frank Act includes numerous provisions that have affected and will affect large and small financial institutions alike, including banks and bank holding companies and how they will be regulated in the future. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, there has been and will be in the future additional regulatory oversight and supervision of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
 
The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes new capital requirements on bank holding companies; provides that a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and stand ready to commit resources to support each of them; changes the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than its deposit base, and permanently raises the current standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expands the FDIC’s authority to raise insurance premiums.  The legislation also calls for the FDIC to raise the ratio of reserves to deposits from 1.15% to 1.35% for deposit insurance purposes by September 30, 2020 and to “offset the effect” of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. 
   
 14
  
The CFPB, which was created by the Dodd-Frank Act, has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards, and contains provisions on mortgage-related matters such as steering incentives and determinations as to a borrower’s ability to repay the principal amount and prepayment penalties.  
 
The CFPB has primary examination and enforcement authority over FirstBank and other banks with over $10 billion in assets with respect to consumer financial products and services.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also limits interchange fees payable on debit card transactions. The Federal Reserve Board’s current debit card interchange rule caps a debit card issuer’s base fee at 21 cents per transaction and allows an additional 5 basis-point charge per transaction to help cover fraud losses. The debit card interchange rule has reduced our interchange fee revenue in line with industry-wide expectations since 2011.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly-traded companies and allows financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts.  The legislation also restricts proprietary trading, places restrictions on the owning or sponsoring of hedge and private equity funds, and regulates the derivatives activities of banks and their affiliates.  
 
Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Collins Amendment”), among other things, eliminates certain trust-preferred securities from Tier I capital.  Preferred securities issued under the U.S. Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) are exempt from this treatment.  Bank holding companies, such as the Corporation, were required to fully phase out these instruments from Tier 1 capital by January 1, 2016; however, these instruments may remain in Tier 2 capital until the instruments are redeemed or mature. 
 Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Coverage Developments.
The federal banking agencies adopted new rules for U.S. banks that revise important aspects of the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the components of regulatory capital, and the risk-based capital treatment of bank assets and off-balance sheet exposures.  The final rules, which currently apply to the Corporation and FirstBank, generally are intended to align U.S. regulatory capital requirements with international regulatory capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”), in particular the most recent international capital accord adopted in 2010 (and revised in 2011) known as “Basel III.”  The current rules increase the quantity and quality of capital required by, among other things, establishing a minimum common equity capital requirement and an additional common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer. In addition, the current rules revise and harmonize the bank regulators’ rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and address weaknesses that have been identified, by applying a variation of the Basel III “standardized approach” for the risk-weighting of bank assets and off-balance sheet exposures to all U.S. banking organizations other than large internationally active banks.
 Consistent with Basel III and the Collins Amendment, the current rules also establish a more conservative standard for including an instrument such as trust-preferred securities as Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $15 billion or more as of December 31, 2009.  Bank holding companies such as the Corporation were required to fully phase out these instruments from Tier I capital by January 1, 2016, although qualifying trust- preferred securities may be included as Tier 2 capital until the instruments are redeemed or mature. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $178.6 million in trust-preferred securities that are subject to a full phase-out from Tier 1 capital under the final regulatory capital rules discussed above.  During the first quarter of 2018, the Corporation completed the repurchase of $23.8 million of trust-preferred securities of the FBP Statutory Trust I that were auctioned in a public sale at which the Corporation was invited to participate. This transaction is described in more detail in “Significant Events Since the Beginning of 2018” above.
 
The current capital rules became effective for the Corporation and our subsidiary bank on a multi-year transitional basis starting on January 1, 2015, and, in general, are fully effective as of January 1, 2019, although certain elements of the new rules have been deferred by the federal banking agencies.  The new general minimum regulatory capital requirements and the “standardized approach” for risk weighting of a banking organization’s assets, however, fully apply to us.  The rules have increased our regulatory capital requirements and require us to hold more capital against certain of our assets and off-balance sheet exposures.  The Corporation’s estimated pro-forma common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, total capital ratio, and the leverage ratio under the Basel III rules, giving effect as of December 31, 2018 to all the provisions that were deferred, were 19.86%, 20.26%, 23.50%, and 15.37%, respectively.  These ratios would exceed the fully phased-in minimum capital ratios under Basel III.  
  
 15
  
These regulatory capital requirements are discussed in further detail in “Regulation and Supervision – Bank and Bank Holding Company Regulatory Capital Requirements.”  
International Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Coverage Developments
International regulatory developments can affect the regulation and supervision of U.S. banking organizations, including the Corporation and FirstBank. Both the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board (established in April 2009 by the Group of Twenty (“G-20”) Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors) have agreed to take action to strengthen regulation and supervision of the financial system with greater international consistency, cooperation and transparency, including the adoption of Basel III and a commitment to raise capital standards and liquidity buffers within the banking system under Basel III.  
 In late 2014, the Basel Committee issued its final requirements for a Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”).  The NSFR compares the amount of an institution’s available stable funding (“ASF”, the ratio’s numerator) to its required stable funding (“RSF”, the ratio’s denominator) to measure how the institution’s asset base is funded.  ASF is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over the time horizon considered by the NSFR, which extends to one year. While the NSFR is intended to be applied to large, internationally active banks, at the discretion of national supervisors it can be applied to other banking organizations or classes of banking organizations.  As proposed by the U.S. federal banking agencies in May 2016, however, the NSFR requirements would not apply to the Corporation.
 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
 CFPB regulations issued over the past few years implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”).  In general, among other changes, these regulations collectively: (i) require lenders to make a reasonable good faith determination of a prospective residential mortgage borrower’s ability to repay based on specific underwriting criteria and set standards related to the determination by mortgage lenders of a consumer’s ability to repay the mortgage; (ii) require stricter underwriting of “qualified mortgages,” discussed below, that presumptively satisfies the ability to pay requirement (thereby providing the lender a safe harbor from non-compliance claims); (iii) specify new limitations on loan originator compensation and establish criteria for the qualifications of, and registration or licensing of, loan originators; (iv) further restrict certain high-cost mortgage loans by expanding the coverage of the Home Ownership and Equity Protections Act of 1994; (v) expand mandated loan escrow accounts for certain loans; (vi) revise existing appraisal requirements under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and require provision of a free copy of all appraisals to applicants for first lien loans; (vii) establish new appraisal standards for most “higher-risk mortgages” under TILA; (viii) combine in a single, new form required loan disclosures under TILA and RESPA; (ix) define a “qualified mortgage” for purposes of the Dodd Frank Act; and (x) afford safe harbor legal protections for lenders making qualified loans that are not “higher priced.”
 The CFPB also has issued regulations setting forth new mortgage servicing rules that apply to the Bank.  
 The regulations affect notices given to consumers as to delinquency, foreclosure alternatives and loss mitigation, modification applications, interest rate adjustments and options for avoiding “force-placed” insurance.  Servicers are prohibited from processing foreclosures when a loan modification is pending, and must wait until a loan is more than 120 days delinquent before initiating a foreclosure action.
 The servicer must provide direct and ongoing access to its personnel, and provide prompt review of any loss mitigation application.  Servicers must maintain accurate and accessible mortgage records for the life of a loan and until one year after the loan is paid off or transferred.  
 In October 2016, the CFPB adopted further changes to these mortgage servicing rules.  These changes generally clarify and amend provisions regarding force-placed insurance notices, policies and procedures, early intervention, loss mitigation requirements and periodic statement requirements under the CFPB mortgage servicing rules.  The amendments also address proper compliance regarding certain servicing requirements when a consumer is a potential or confirmed successor in interest, is in bankruptcy, or sends a cease communication request under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. These amendments became generally effective in October 2017, although provisions relating to successors-in-interest and periodic statements when a consumer is in bankruptcy became effective in April 2018.  These new mortgage servicing standards added to our costs of conducting a mortgage servicing business. 
   
 16
  
The Dodd-Frank Act directs the CFPB to publish rules and forms that combine certain disclosures that consumers receive in connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan under the TILA and the RESPA. Consistent with this requirement, the CFPB has amended Regulation X (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) and Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) to establish new disclosure requirements and forms in Regulation Z for most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. In addition to combining the existing disclosure requirements and implementing new requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the rule provides extensive guidance regarding compliance with those requirements.
 Under new leadership (Michael Mulvaney, who was appointed acting Director of the CFPB in November 2017, and more recently Kathy Kraninger, who was confirmed as permanent Director in December 2018), however, the CFPB has taken and may continue to take regulatory actions that may have material deregulatory effects, including the reconsideration of existing CFPB regulations, and an assessment of the effectiveness of other regulatory actions.  The nature, scope and impact of these actions, however, and their impact on the Corporation and FirstBank, cannot be predicted at this time. 
 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.  
 
In May 2018, President Trump signed into law the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act ("EGRRCPA").  EGRRCPA makes a number of changes to the Dodd-Frank Act and other federal banking laws that were generally intended to be deregulatory in nature.  While many of the more significant changes apply to large banking organizations and not to mid-size banking organizations such as the Corporation, other provisions of EGRRCPA make changes to certain banking law requirements that we believe will help reduce our regulatory burden, including:

• | Prohibiting federal banking regulators from imposing higher regulatory capital requirements on High Volatility Commercial Real Estate (“HVCRE”) exposures unless they are for acquisition, development or construction (“ADC”), and clarifying ADC status; 
• | Exempting from federal mortgage appraisal requirements certain transactions involving real property in rural areas and valued at less than $400,000; and 
• | Directing the CFPB to provide guidance on the applicability of the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule to mortgage assumption transactions and construction-to-permanent home loans, as well the extent to which lenders can rely on model disclosures that do not reflect recent regulatory changes. 

 
Since EGRRCPA’s enactment, the federal banking agencies (the Federal Reserve Board, FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) have taken rulemaking and other actions to implement the legislation’s requirements, and are expected to continue doing so in 2019.  Despite these changes, most provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations remain in place and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation. 
 Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests ("DFAST").

On July 6, 2018, bank regulatory agencies issued a joint interagency statement regarding the impact of EGRRCPA on, among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act stress-testing requirements applicable to bank holding companies and other financial companies.  According to the interagency statement, EGRRCPA gave immediate relief from the company-run stress testing requirements for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $100 billion, but the agencies have extended the deadlines for all regulatory requirements related to company-run stress testing for depository institutions with average total consolidated assets of less than $100 billion until November 25, 2019. In turn, the federal banking agencies have proposed rule changes that, among other things, fully implement the asset threshold increase for company-run stress tests. Pursuant to direction from the regulators, the Corporation was provided similar relief and is no longer required to submit company-run annual stress tests. Notwithstanding these amendments to the stress testing requirements, the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than $100 billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process.  Although the Corporation will continue to monitor its capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators, the Corporation will no longer conduct company-run stress testing as a result of the legislative and regulatory amendments. The Corporation continues to use customized stress testing to support the business and as part of its capital planning process.

The Volcker Rule.
This section of the Dodd-Frank Act, subject to important exceptions, generally prohibits a banking entity such as the Corporation or FirstBank from acquiring or retaining any ownership in, or acting as sponsor to, a hedge fund or private equity fund (“covered fund”).  The Volcker Rule also prohibits these entities from engaging, for their own account, in short-form proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments.
 Final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule have been adopted by the financial regulatory agencies and are now generally effective. 
 
The Corporation and the Bank are not engaged in proprietary trading as defined in the Volcker Rule. In addition, a review of the Corporation’s investments was undertaken to determine if any meet the Volcker Rule’s definition of covered funds. Based on that review, the Corporation’s investments are not considered covered funds under the Volcker Rule.  
 
Community Reinvestment Act and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Regulations.

The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) encourages banks to help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which the banks offer their services, including low- and moderate-income individuals, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank.
 The CRA requires the federal supervisory agencies, as part of the general examination of supervised banks, to assess the bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community, assign a performance rating, and take such record and rating into account in their evaluation of certain applications by such bank. The CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. FirstBank received a “satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent examination by the FDIC.
 Failure to adequately serve the communities could result in the denial by the regulators of proposals to merge, consolidate or acquire new assets, as well as expand or relocate branches.  
 
The federal bank regulatory agencies have amended their respective CRA regulations primarily to conform to changes made by the CFPB to Regulation C, which implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”).
 
Since 1995, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have conformed certain definitions in their respective CRA regulations to the scope of loans reported under Regulation C and believe that continuing to do so produces a less burdensome CRA performance evaluation process. In particular, the agencies have amended their CRA regulations to revise the definitions of "home mortgage loan" and "consumer loan," as well as the public file content requirements. These revisions maintain consistency between the CRA regulations and amendments to Regulation C, which generally became effective on January 1, 2018.
 
In addition, the final rule contains technical corrections and removes obsolete references to the Neighborhood Stabilization Program.
 
The amendments to the CRA regulations also became effective on January 1, 2018.
 
Future Legislation and Regulation.

While the federal agencies have adopted regulations that implement many requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, important regulatory actions (e.g., the adoption of rules regarding the compensation of financial institutions executives) that could have an impact on the Corporation and the Bank remain to be taken.  Additional consumer protection laws may be enacted, and the FDIC, Federal Reserve and CFPB have adopted and may adopt in the future new regulations that have addressed or may address, among other things, banks’ credit card, overdraft, collection, privacy and mortgage lending practices.  Additional consumer protection regulatory activity is possible in the near future.  
 
Any proposals and legislation, if finally adopted and implemented, would change banking laws and our operating environment and that of our subsidiaries in ways that could be substantial and unpredictable.  We cannot determine whether such proposals and legislation will be adopted, or the ultimate effect that such proposals and legislation, if enacted, or regulations issued to implement the same, would have upon our financial condition or results of operations.

Bank Holding Company Activities and Other Limitations
 
The Corporation is registered and subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Bank Holding Company Act” or “BHC Act”).  Under the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act, a bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before it acquires direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of another bank, or merges or consolidates with another bank holding company. The Federal Reserve Board also has authority under certain circumstances to issue cease and desist orders, and assess substantial civil money penalties, against bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries. In addition, the Corporation is subject to ongoing regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board periodic and annual reports and other information concerning its own business operations and those of its subsidiaries.
 
A bank holding company is prohibited under the Bank Holding Company Act, with limited exceptions, from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any business unrelated to the businesses of banking or managing or controlling banks. One of the exceptions to these prohibitions permits ownership by a bank holding company of the shares of any corporation if the Federal Reserve Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, by regulation or order has determined that the activities of the corporation in question are so closely related to the businesses of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. 
 
The Bank Holding Company Act also permits a bank holding company to elect to become a financial holding company and engage in a broad range of activities that are financial in nature. The Corporation filed an election with the Federal Reserve Board and became a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act.  Financial holding companies may engage, directly or indirectly, in any activity that is determined to be (i) financial in nature, (ii) incidental to such financial activity, or (iii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. The Bank Holding Company Act specifically provides that the following activities have been determined to be “financial in nature”: (a) lending, trust and other banking activities; (b) insurance activities; (c) financial or economic advice or services; (d) pooled investments; (e) securities underwriting and dealing; (f) domestic activities permitted for existing bank holding company; (g) foreign activities permitted for existing bank holding company; and (h) merchant banking activities.
 
A financial holding company that ceases to meet certain standards is subject to a variety of restrictions, depending on the circumstances, including precluding the undertaking of new activities or the acquisition of shares or control of other companies. Until compliance is restored, the Federal Reserve Board has broad discretion to impose appropriate limitations on the financial holding company’s activities.  If compliance is not restored within 180 days, the Federal Reserve Board may ultimately require the financial holding company to divest its depository institutions or, in the alternative, to discontinue or divest any activities that are not permitted to non-financial holding company bank holding companies. The Corporation and FirstBank must be well-capitalized and well-managed for regulatory purposes, and FirstBank must earn “satisfactory” or better ratings on its periodic CRA examinations to preserve the financial holding company status. The Corporation currently is restricted in its ability to engage in new activities or the acquisition of shares or control of other companies without the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board  
 The potential restrictions are different if the lapse pertains to the CRA.  In that case, until all the subsidiary institutions are restored to at least a “satisfactory” CRA rating status, the financial holding company may not engage, directly or through a subsidiary, in any of the additional financial activities permissible under the Bank Holding Company Act or make additional acquisitions of companies engaged in the additional activities.  However, completed acquisitions and additional activities and affiliations previously begun are left undisturbed, as the Bank Holding Company Act does not require divestiture for this type of situation.
 
Under provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company such as the Corporation is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries and to commit support to them. This support may be required at times when, absent such policy, the bank holding company might not otherwise provide such support. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and be entitled to a priority of payment. 
 
   In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks must be subordinated in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. As of December 31, 2018, and the date hereof, FirstBank was and is the only depository institution subsidiary of the Corporation.  The Dodd-Frank Act directs the Federal Reserve Board to adopt regulations adopting the statutory source-of-strength requirements, but implementing regulations have not yet been proposed.

USA PATRIOT Act and Other Anti-Money Laundering Requirements.  
 
As a regulated depository institution, FirstBank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act, which imposes a variety of reporting and other requirements, including the requirement to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports that are designed to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal activities. In addition, under Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, also known as the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorism Financing Act of 2001, all financial institutions are required to, among other things, identify their customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or prohibit altogether certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning their customers and their transactions. Presently, only certain types of financial institutions (including banks, savings associations and money services businesses) are subject to final rules implementing the anti-money laundering program requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act.
 
Regulations implementing the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act are published and primarily enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury.  Failure of a financial institution, such as the Corporation or the Bank, to comply with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act or the USA PATRIOT Act could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including the possibility of regulatory enforcement or other legal action, including significant civil money penalties. The Corporation also is required to comply with federal economic and trade sanctions requirements enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury.  The Corporation has adopted appropriate policies, procedures and controls to address compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, USA PATRIOT Act and economic/trade sanctions requirements, and to implement banking agency, U.S. Treasury and OFAC regulations.
 
In May 11, 2016, FinCEN issued its final rules under the Bank Secrecy Act to clarify and strengthen customer due diligence requirements for: Banks; brokers or dealers in securities; mutual funds; and futures commission merchants and introducing brokers in commodities (the “Rule”). The Rule contains explicit customer due diligence requirements and include a new requirement to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. Under the Rule, covered financial institutions must establish procedures to:
 
·         Identify each natural person that directly or indirectly owns 25% or more of the equity interests of a legal entity customer (the “ownership prong”); 
 ·         Identify one natural person with “significant responsibility to control, manage, or direct” a legal entity customer (the “control prong”), which may be a person reported under the ownership prong; and, 
 ·         Verify the identities of those persons according to risk-based procedures, which procedures must include the elements currently required under the Customer Identification Rule at a minimum. Identification of those beneficial owners must be conducted at the time a new account is opened. 
 
Compliance with the Rule’s requirements was mandatory by May 11, 2018 (the “Applicability Date”). FirstBank implemented the Rule by the Applicability Date.
 
State Chartered Non-Member Bank and Banking Laws and Regulations in General
 
FirstBank is subject to regulation and examination by the OCIF, the CFPB and the FDIC, and is subject to comprehensive federal and state (Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) regulations dealing with a wide variety of subjects. The federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their businesses, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing and availability of deposited funds, and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans. In addition to the impact of regulations, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy.  Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate, and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits.  These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits.  Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.  The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.  The effects of such policies upon our future business, earnings and growth cannot be predicted.

There are periodic examinations by the OCIF, the CFPB and the FDIC of FirstBank to test the Bank’s conformance to safe and sound banking practices and compliance with various statutory and regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework and oversight of activities in which a banking institution can engage.  The regulation and supervision by the FDIC are intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and for engaging in unsafe or unsound practices. In addition, certain bank actions are required by statute and implementing regulations. Other actions or failure to act may provide the basis for enforcement action, including the filing of misleading or untimely reports with regulatory authorities.
 
Written Agreement
 
FirstBank was notified by the FDIC that the Consent Order under which the Bank had been operating since June 2, 2010 was terminated effective April 29, 2015.  FirstBank is required to maintain capital at specified levels pursuant to applicable law and its agreement with its regulators and currently exceeds all minimum capital requirements. 
 
In October 2017, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York terminated the formal written agreement (the “Written Agreement”) entered into on June 3, 2010 between the Corporation and the Federal Reserve. However, the Corporation has agreed with its regulators to continue to obtain approval before paying dividends, receiving dividends from the Bank, making payments on subordinated debt or trust preferred securities, incurring or guaranteeing debt or purchasing or redeeming any corporate stock.
 
Dividend Restrictions
 The Federal Reserve Board’s “Applying Supervisory Guidance and Regulations on the Payment of Dividends, Stock Redemptions, and Stock Repurchases at Bank Holding Companies” (the “Supervisory Letter”) discusses the ability of bank holding companies to declare dividends and to repurchase equity securities.  The Supervisory Letter is generally consistent with prior Federal Reserve supervisory policies and guidance, although it places greater emphasis on discussions with the regulators prior to dividend declarations and redemption or repurchase decisions even when not explicitly required by the regulations.  The Federal Reserve Board provides that the principles discussed in the letter are applicable to all bank holding companies.
 
The Federal Reserve Board has also issued a policy statement that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company should generally not maintain a given rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fund fully the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The Corporation is subject to certain restrictions generally imposed on Puerto Rico corporations with respect to the declaration and payment of dividends (i.e., that dividends may be paid out only from the Corporation’s net assets in excess of capital or, in the absence of such excess, from the Corporation’s net earnings for such fiscal year and/or the preceding fiscal year).
 
The principal source of funds for the Corporation’s parent holding company is dividends declared and paid by its subsidiary, FirstBank. Pursuant to its agreement with the Federal Reserve, the Corporation cannot directly or indirectly take dividends or any other form of payment representing a reduction in capital from the Bank without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. The ability of FirstBank to declare and pay dividends on its capital stock is regulated by the Puerto Rico Banking Law, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), and FDIC regulations. In general terms, the Puerto Rico Banking Law provides that when the expenditures of a bank are greater than receipts, the excess of expenditures over receipts shall be charged against undistributed profits of the bank and the balance, if any, shall be charged against the required reserve fund of the bank. If the reserve fund is not sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the outstanding amount must be charged against the bank’s capital account. The Puerto Rico Banking Law provides that, until said capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original capital, the bank may not declare any dividends. In general terms, the FDIA and the FDIC regulations restrict the payment of dividends when a bank is undercapitalized, when a bank has failed to pay insurance assessments, or when there are safety and soundness concerns regarding such bank.

On November 14, 2018, for the first time since July 2009, the Corporation’s Board of Directors, after receiving regulatory approval, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per common share, which was paid on December 14, 2018 to common stockholders of record on November 30, 2018. Total cash dividends paid on shares of common stock amounted to $6.5 million for 2018. In addition, since the fourth quarter of 2016, following receipt of the requisite regulatory approval, the Corporation has paid monthly cash dividends on its outstanding shares of Series A through E Noncumulative Perpetual Monthly Income Preferred Stock. The Corporation has to date received approval to pay the monthly dividends on the Corporation’s Series A through E Preferred Stock and quarterly dividends on common stock through December 2019, subject to conditions established in the agreement with regulators.  Further, after December 2019, the Corporation intends to continue to request the Federal Reserve’s approval to enable it to continue to pay the monthly dividends on its Series A through E Preferred Stock and quarterly dividends on common stock, although there is no assurance that any dividends will be declared on the Corporation’s Series A through E Preferred Stock or common stock in any future periods So long as any shares of preferred stock remain outstanding, we cannot declare, set apart or pay any dividends on shares of our common stock unless any accrued and unpaid dividends on our preferred stock for the twelve monthly dividend periods ending on the immediately preceding dividend payment date have been paid or are paid contemporaneously and the full monthly dividend on our preferred stock for the then current month has been or is contemporaneously declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment.
 Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity
 
The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is used in diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and application information. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services.
 
The federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions. A financial institution is expected to establish multiple lines of defense and to ensure their risk management processes address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to effectively respond and recover the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical service provider of the institution falls victim to this type of cyber-attack. The Corporation’s Information Security Program reflects the requirements of this guidance.
 
Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
 
Certain transactions between FDIC-insured banks financial institutions such as FirstBank and its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and by Federal Reserve Regulation W. An affiliate of a bank is, in general, any corporation or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank. 
 
In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies that are controlled by such parent bank holding company are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (i) limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” (defined below) with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such bank’s capital stock and surplus, and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such bank’s capital stock and surplus and (ii) require that all “covered transactions” be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or affiliate, as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and other similar transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the bank to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. The Dodd-Frank Act added derivatives and securities lending and borrowing transactions to the list of “covered transactions” subject to Section 23A restrictions.
   
 22
  
In addition, Sections 22(h) and (g) of the Federal Reserve Act, implemented through Regulation O, place restrictions on commercial bank loans to executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders of the bank and its affiliates. Under Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act bank loans to a director, an executive officer, a greater than 10% stockholder of the bank, and certain related interests of these persons, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated interests, the bank’s loans to one borrower limit, generally equal to 15% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act also requires that loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons and also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to insiders cannot exceed the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers.
 
Executive Compensation
 
In 2010, the federal banking agencies adopted interagency guidance governing incentive-based compensation programs, which applies to all banking organizations regardless of asset size. This guidance uses a principles-based approach to ensure that incentive-based compensation arrangements appropriately tie rewards to longer-term performance and do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations or create undue risks to the financial system.  The interagency guidance is based on three major principles: (i) balanced risk-taking incentives; (ii) compatibility with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) strong corporate governance.  The guidance further provides that, where appropriate, the banking agencies will take supervisory or enforcement action to ensure that material deficiencies that pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the organization are promptly addressed. 
 
In May 2016, as required under section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies, along with other federal regulatory agencies, proposed regulations (first proposed in 2011) governing incentive-based compensation practices at covered banking institutions, which would include, among others, all banking organizations with assets of $1 billion or greater.  These proposed rules are intended to better align the financial rewards for covered employees with an institution’s long-term safety and soundness. Portions of these proposed rules would apply to the Corporation and FirstBank. Those applicable provisions would generally (i) prohibit types and features of incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk because they are “excessive” or “could lead to material financial loss” at the banking institution; (ii) require incentive-based compensation arrangements to adhere to three basic principles: (1) a balance between risk and reward; (2) effective risk management and controls; and (3) effective governance; and (iii) require appropriate board of directors (or committee) oversight and recordkeeping and disclosures to the banking institution’s primary regulatory agency. The nature and substance of any final action to adopt these proposed rules, and the timing of any such action, are not known at this time.
 
Bank and Bank Holding Company Regulatory Capital Requirements
 
The Federal Reserve Board has adopted risk-based and leverage capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the Bank Holding Company Act.  The Federal Reserve Board’s historical risk-based capital guidelines were based upon the 1988 capital accord (“Basel I”) of the Basel Committee.  These historical requirements, however, which included a legacy simplified risk-weighting system for the calculations of risk-based assets, as well as lower leverage capital requirements, were superseded by new risk-based and leverage capital requirements that went into effect, on a multi-year transitional basis, on January 1, 2015. The FDIC has adopted substantively identical requirements that apply to insured banks under its regulation and supervision. These requirements are part of a revised regulatory capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Basel III rules”) adopted by the banking agencies that is based on international regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Basel Committee over the past several years.  
 
The Basel III rules introduced new minimum capital ratios and capital conservation buffer requirements, change the composition of regulatory capital, require a number of new adjustments to and deductions from regulatory capital, and introduced a new “Standardized Approach” for the calculation of risk-weighted assets that replaced the risk-weighting requirements under prior U.S. regulatory capital rules.  The new minimum regulatory capital requirements and the Standardized Approach for the calculation of risk-weighted assets became effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015. 
   
 23
  
Although the Corporation and FirstBank became subject to the Basel III rules beginning on January 1, 2015, certain requirements of the Basel III rules are being phased-in over several years and, in general, are effective as of January 1, 2019. Certain elements of the rules also have been deferred by the federal banking agencies. The Corporation and FirstBank compute risk-weighted assets using the Standardized Approach required by the Basel III rules.  
 The Basel III rules require the Corporation to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% to avoid limitations on both (i) capital distributions (e.g., repurchases of capital instruments, dividends and interest payments on capital instruments), and (ii) discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and heads of major business lines. The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 with a first year requirement of 0.625% of additional Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (“CET1”), which was progressively increased over a four-year period, increasing by that same percentage amount on each subsequent January 1 until it reached the fully phased-in 2.5% CET1 requirement on January 1, 2019.
 
Under the fully phased-in Basel III rules, in order to be considered adequately capitalized, the Corporation is required to maintain: (i) a minimum CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 4.5%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, resulting in a required minimum CET1 ratio of at least 7%; (ii) a minimum ratio of total Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, resulting in a required minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%; (iii) a minimum ratio of total Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, resulting in a required minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%; and (iv) a required minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average on-balance sheet (non-risk adjusted) assets.
 
In addition, the Basel III rules require a number of new deductions from and adjustments to CET1, including deductions from CET1 for certain intangible assets, and deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income; the four-year phase-in period for these adjustments generally began on January 1, 2015.  Mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets attributable to temporary differences, among others, are required to be deducted to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. 
 
The Basel III rules also require that certain non-qualifying capital instruments, including cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities (“TRUPs”), be excluded from Tier 1 capital. In general, banking organizations such as the Corporation began to phase out TRUPs from Tier 1 capital on January 1, 2015. The outstanding balances owed on the Corporation’s TRUPs were fully phased out from Tier 1 capital as of January 1, 2016. However, the Corporation’s TRUPs may continue to be included in Tier 2 capital until the instruments are redeemed or mature.
 
On November 21, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board, FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency finalized an extension of the phase-in of certain Basel III rules for banks not using the Basel advanced approaches. The extension, which was effective January 1, 2018, pauses the full transition to the Basel III treatment of mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interests, pending the banking agencies’ broader efforts, announced in September 2017, to simply the regulatory capital rules that apply to banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rules. Because the advanced approaches rules apply only to banking organizations with more than $250 billion in total consolidated assets or at least $10 billion in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure, the extension relief applies broadly to community, midsize, and regional banks, including the Corporation and FirstBank.
 
The Corporation and FirstBank compute risk weighted assets using the Standardized Approach required by the Basel III rules. The Standardized Approach for risk-weightings has expanded the risk-weighting categories from the four major risk-weighting categories under the previous regulatory capital rules (0%, 20%, 50%, and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets. In a number of cases, the Standardized Approach results in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. Specific changes to the risk-weightings of assets include, among other things: (i) applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans, (ii) assigning a 150% risk weight to exposures that are 90 days past due (other than qualifying residential mortgage exposures, which remain at an assigned risk-weighting of 100%), (iii) establishing a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable, in contrast to the 0% risk-weighting under the prior rules and (iv) requiring capital to be maintained against on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet exposures that result from certain cleared transactions, guarantees and credit derivatives, and collateralized transactions (such as repurchase agreement transactions).

Prompt Corrective Action.  
 
The Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) provisions of the FDIA require the federal bank regulatory agencies to take prompt corrective action against any undercapitalized insured depository institution.  The FDIA establishes five capital categories: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Well-capitalized insured depository institutions (“institutions”) significantly exceed the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure.  Adequately capitalized institutions include institutions that meet but do not significantly exceed the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. Undercapitalized institutions consist of those that fail to meet the required minimum level for one or more relevant capital measures. Significantly undercapitalized institutions are those with capital levels significantly below the minimum requirements for any relevant capital measure. Critically undercapitalized institutions have minimal capital and are at serious risk for government seizure.    
 
Under certain circumstances, a well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category.  An institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions (including paying dividends), or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized.  Institutions that are adequately capitalized but not well-capitalized cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the FDIC and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits.  Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits.
 
The federal bank regulatory agencies are permitted or, in certain cases, required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories.  Depending on the level of an institution’s capital, the agencies’ corrective powers include, among other things: 
 
·         prohibiting the payment of principal and interest on subordinated debt;
 ·         prohibiting the holding company from making distributions without prior regulatory approval;
 ·         placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities;
 ·         placing additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates;
 ·         restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits;
 ·         prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; and
 ·         in the most severe cases, appointing a conservator or receiver for the institution.
 
An institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan, and such a plan will not be accepted unless, among other things, the institution’s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount.  Any such guarantee from an institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy.  
 The banking agencies’ Basel III rules, discussed above, revise the PCA requirements by (i) introducing a separate CET1 ratio requirement for each PCA capital category (other than critically undercapitalized) with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each PCA capital category with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the previous 6%); and (iii) eliminating the previous provision that allows a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 to have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized and maintaining the minimum leverage ratio for well-capitalized status at 5%. The Basel III rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement (10% for well-capitalized status) for any PCA capital category.  The new PCA requirements became effective on January 1, 2015.
 
A bank’s capital category, as determined by applying the prompt corrective action provisions of the law, may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of a bank, such as the Bank, and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the financial condition and results of operations of the bank.

Deposit Insurance
 
The increase in deposit insurance coverage to up to $250,000 per customer, the FDIC’s expanded authority to increase insurance premiums, as well as the increase in the number of bank failures after the 2008 financial crisis, resulted in an increase in deposit insurance assessments for all banks, including FirstBank. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the requirements for the Deposit Insurance Fund by requiring that the designated reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund for any year not be less than 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits or the comparable percentage of the new deposit assessment base.  In addition, the FDIC must take steps as necessary for the reserve ratio to reach 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits by September 30, 2020.  If the reserve ratio exceeds 1.5 percent, the FDIC must dividend to Deposit Insurance Fund members the amount above the amount necessary to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund at 1.5 percent, but the FDIC Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, suspend or limit the declaration of payment of dividends.  The FDIC has adopted a Deposit Reserve Fund restoration plan that projects that the designated reserve ratio will reach 1.35 percent by the 2020 deadline. The FDIC has also adopted a final rule raising its industry target ratio of reserves to insured deposits to 2 percent, 65 basis points above the statutory minimum, but the FDIC does not project that goal to be met for several years. 
 
The FDIC assessment rules currently define the assessment base for deposit insurance as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, specify assessment rates, implement the Dodd-Frank Act’s Deposit Insurance Fund dividend provisions, and revise the risk-based assessment system for all large insured depository institutions (institutions with at least $10 billion in total assets), such as FirstBank. In March 2016, the FDIC adopted a rule, which became effective on July 1, 2016, to increase the Deposit Insurance Fund to the statutorily required minimum level of 1.35 percent. Among other things, the rule imposes on banks with at least $10 billion in assets (which includes the Bank) a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. 
 
On September 30, 2018, the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached 1.36 percent, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35 percent ahead of the September 30, 2020, deadline required under the Dodd-Frank Act. FDIC regulations provide for two changes to deposit insurance assessments upon reaching the minimum: (1) surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, such as FirstBank, will cease; and (2) small banks will receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15 percent and 1.35 percent, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38 percent.
 
FDIC Insolvency Authority
 
Under Puerto Rico banking laws (discussed below), the OCIF may appoint the FDIC as conservator or receiver of a failed or failing FDIC-insured Puerto Rican bank, such as the Bank, and the FDIA authorizes the FDIC to accept such an appointment. In addition, the FDIC has broad authority under the FDIA to appoint itself as conservator or receiver of a failed or failing state bank, including a Puerto Rican bank. If the FDIC is appointed conservator or receiver of a bank upon the bank’s insolvency or the occurrence of other events, the FDIC may sell or transfer some, part or all of a bank’s assets and liabilities to another bank, or liquidate the bank and pay out insured depositors, as well as uninsured depositors and other creditors to the extent of the closed bank’s available assets. As part of its insolvency authority, the FDIC has the authority, among other things, to take possession of and administer the receivership estate, pay out estate claims, and repudiate or disaffirm certain types of contracts to which the bank was a party if the FDIC believes such contract is burdensome and its disaffirmance will aid in the administration of the receivership.  In resolving the estate of a failed bank, the FDIC as receiver will first satisfy its own administrative expenses, and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities also have priority over those of other general unsecured creditors.
  26
  

Activities and Investments
 
The activities as “principal” of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks, such as FirstBank, are generally limited to those that are permissible for national banks. Similarly, under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state-chartered bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank.
Federal Home Loan Bank System
 
FirstBank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) system. The FHLB system consists of eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks governed and regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Federal Home Loan Banks serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions. They are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system, and they make loans (advances) to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the FHLB system and the board of directors of each regional FHLB.
 
FirstBank is a member of the FHLB of New York and, as such, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of New York in an amount calculated in accordance with the requirements set forth in applicable laws and regulations. FirstBank is in compliance with the stock ownership requirements of the FHLB of New York. All loans, advances and other extensions of credit made by the FHLB to FirstBank are secured by a portion of FirstBank’s mortgage loan portfolio, certain other investments and the capital stock of the FHLB held by FirstBank.
 
Ownership and Control
 Because of FirstBank’s status as an FDIC-insured bank, as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act, the Corporation, as the owner of FirstBank’s common stock, is subject to certain restrictions and disclosure obligations under various federal laws, including the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act (the “CBCA”). Regulations adopted pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act and the CBCA generally require prior Federal Reserve Board or other federal banking agency approval or non-objection for an acquisition of control of an insured institution (as defined in the Act) or holding company thereof by any person (or persons acting in concert). Control is deemed to exist if, among other things, a person (or group of persons acting in concert) acquires 25% or more of any class of voting stock of an insured institution or holding company thereof. Under the CBCA, control is presumed to exist subject to rebuttal if a person (or group of persons acting in concert) acquires 10% or more of any class of voting stock and either (i) the corporation has registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or (ii) no person (or group of persons acting in concert) will own, control or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. The concept of acting in concert is very broad and also is subject to certain rebuttable presumptions, including, among others, that relatives, business partners, management officials, affiliates and others are presumed to be acting in concert with each other and their businesses. The regulations of the FDIC implementing the CBCA are generally similar to those described above. 
 The Puerto Rico Banking Law requires the approval of the OCIF for changes in control of a Puerto Rico bank. See “Puerto Rico Banking Law.”
 Standards for Safety and Soundness
 The FDIA requires the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards of safety and soundness, by regulations or guidelines, relating generally to operations and management, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation, and compensation. The implementing regulations and guidelines of the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the regulations and guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The regulations and guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. Failure to comply with these standards can result in administrative enforcement or other adverse actions against the bank.
 Brokered Deposits
 FDIC regulations adopted under the FDIA govern the receipt of brokered deposits by banks. Well-capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits, while adequately-capitalized institutions are able to accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to certain restrictions on the interest paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are not permitted to accept brokered deposits.

 Puerto Rico Banking Law
 
As a commercial bank organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, FirstBank is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by OCIF pursuant to the Puerto Rico Banking Law of 1933, as amended (the “Banking Law”).
 
The Banking Law contains various provisions relating to FirstBank and its affairs, including its incorporation and organization, the rights and responsibilities of its directors, officers and stockholders and its corporate powers, lending limitations, capital requirements, and investment requirements. In addition, the Commissioner is given extensive rule-making power and administrative discretion under the Banking Law.
 
The Banking Law authorizes Puerto Rico commercial banks to conduct certain financial and related activities directly or through subsidiaries, including the leasing of personal property and the operation of a small loan business.
 
The Banking Law requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve, which shall not be less than twenty percent (20%) of its demand liabilities, except government deposits (federal, state and municipal) that are secured by actual collateral. The reserve is required to be composed of any of the following securities or a combination thereof: (1) legal tender of the United States; (2) checks on banks or trust companies located in any part of Puerto Rico that are to be presented for collection during the day following the day on which they are received; (3) money deposited in other banks provided said deposits are authorized by the Commissioner and subject to immediate collection; (4) federal funds sold to any Federal Reserve Bank and securities purchased under agreements to resell executed by the bank with such funds that are subject to be repaid to the bank on or before the close of the next business day; and (5) any other asset that the Commissioner identifies from time to time.
 
Section 17 of the Banking Law permits Puerto Rico commercial banks to make loans to any one person, firm, partnership or corporation in an aggregate amount of up to fifteen percent (15%) of the sum of: (i) the bank’s paid-in capital; (ii) the bank’s reserve fund; (iii) 50% of the bank’s retained earnings, subject to certain limitations; and (iv) any other components that the Commissioner may determine from time to time. If such loans are secured by collateral worth at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the loan, the aggregate maximum amount may reach one-third (33.33%) of the sum of the bank’s paid-in capital, reserve fund, 50% of retained earnings, subject to certain limitations, and such other components that the Commissioner may determine from time to time. There are no restrictions under the Banking Law on the amount of loans that may be wholly secured by bonds, securities and other evidences of indebtedness of the Government of the United States, or of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or by bonds, not in default, of municipalities or instrumentalities of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  
 
The Banking Law prohibits Puerto Rico commercial banks from making loans secured by their own stock, and from purchasing their own stock, unless such purchase is made pursuant to a stock repurchase program approved by the Commissioner or is necessary to prevent losses because of a debt previously contracted in good faith. The stock purchased by the Puerto Rico commercial bank must be sold by the bank in a public or private sale within one year from the date of purchase.
 
The Banking Law provides that no officer, director, agent or employee of a Puerto Rico commercial bank may serve as an officer, director, agent or employee of another Puerto Rico commercial bank, financial corporation, savings and loan association, trust corporation, corporation engaged in granting mortgage loans or any other institution engaged in the money lending business in Puerto Rico. This prohibition is not applicable to any such position with an affiliate of a Puerto Rico commercial bank.
 
The Banking Law requires that Puerto Rico commercial banks prepare each year a balance summary of their operations, and submit such balance summary for approval at a regular meeting of stockholders, together with an explanatory report thereon. The Banking Law also requires that at least ten percent (10%) of the yearly net income of a Puerto Rico commercial bank be credited annually to a reserve fund. This credit is required to be done every year until such reserve fund shall be equal to the total paid-in-capital of the bank.
   
 28
  
The Banking Law also provides that when the expenditures of a Puerto Rico commercial bank are greater than receipts, the excess of the expenditures over receipts shall be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, shall be charged against the reserve fund, as a reduction thereof. If there is no reserve fund sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the outstanding amount shall be charged against the capital account and no dividend shall be declared until said capital has been restored to its original amount and the amount in the reserve fund equals twenty percent (20%) of the original capital.
 
The Banking Law requires the prior approval of the Commissioner with respect to a transfer of capital stock of a bank that results in a change of control of the bank. Under the Banking Law, a change of control is presumed to occur if a person or a group of persons acting in concert, directly or indirectly, acquires more than 5% of the outstanding voting capital stock of the bank. The Commissioner has interpreted the restrictions of the Banking Law as applying to acquisitions of voting securities of entities controlling a bank, such as a bank holding company. Under the Banking Law, the determination of the Commissioner whether to approve a change of control filing is final and non-appealable.
 
The Finance Board, which is composed of the Commissioner, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Consumer Affairs, the President of the Economic Development Bank, the President of the Government Development Bank, and the President of the Planning Board, has the authority to regulate the maximum interest rates and finance charges that may be charged on loans to individuals and unincorporated businesses in Puerto Rico. The current regulations of the Finance Board provide that the applicable interest rate on loans to individuals and unincorporated businesses, including real estate development loans but excluding certain other personal and commercial loans secured by mortgages on real estate properties, is to be determined by free competition. Accordingly, the regulations do not set a maximum rate for charges on retail installment sales contracts, small loans, and credit card purchases and set aside previous regulations which regulated these maximum finance charges. Furthermore, there is no maximum rate set for installment sales contracts involving motor vehicles, commercial, agricultural and industrial equipment, commercial electric appliances and insurance premiums.
 
International Banking Act of Puerto Rico (“IBE Act 52”)  
 
The business and operations of FirstBank International Branch (“FirstBank IBE” or the “IBE division of FirstBank”) and FirstBank Overseas Corporation (the IBE subsidiary of FirstBank) are subject to supervision and regulation by the Commissioner. FirstBank and FirstBank Overseas Corporation were created under the IBE Act 52, which provides for total Puerto Rico tax exemption on net income derived by IBEs operating in Puerto Rico on the specific activities identified in the IBE Act. An IBE that operates as a unit of a bank pays income taxes at the corporate standard rates to the extent that the IBE’s net income exceeds 20% of the bank’s total net taxable income. Under the IBE Act 52, certain sales, encumbrances, assignments, mergers, exchanges or transfers of shares, interests or participation(s) in the capital of an international banking entity (an “IBE”) may not be initiated without the prior approval of the Commissioner. The IBE Act 52 and the regulations issued thereunder by the Commissioner (the “IBE Regulations”) limit the business activities that may be carried out by an IBE. Such activities are limited in part to persons and assets located outside of Puerto Rico.
 
Pursuant to the IBE Act 52 and the IBE Regulations, each of FirstBank IBE and FirstBank Overseas Corporation must maintain in Puerto Rico books and records of all its transactions in the ordinary course of business. FirstBank IBE and FirstBank Overseas Corporation are also required thereunder to submit to the Commissioner quarterly and annual reports of their financial condition and results of operations, including annual audited financial statements.
 
The IBE Act 52 empowers the Commissioner to revoke or suspend, after notice and hearing, a license issued thereunder if, among other things, the IBE fails to comply with the IBE Act 52, the IBE Regulations or the terms of its license, or if the Commissioner finds that the business or affairs of the IBE are conducted in a manner that is not consistent with the public interest.
 
In 2012, the Puerto Rico government approved Act Number 273 (“Act 273”).  Act 273 replaces, prospectively, IBE Act 52 with the objective of improving the conditions for conducting international financial transactions in Puerto Rico.  An IBE existing on the date of approval of Act 273, such as FirstBank IBE and FirstBank Overseas Corporation, can continue operating under IBE Act 52, or, it can voluntarily convert to an International Financial Entity (“IFE”) under Act 273 so it may broaden its scope of Eligible IFE Activities, as defined below, and obtain a grant of tax exemption under Act 273.
 
  
 29
  
IFEs are licensed by the Commissioner, and authorized to conduct certain Act 273 specified financial transactions (“Eligible IFE Activities”). Once licensed, an IFE can request a grant of tax exemption (“Tax Grant”) from the Puerto Rico Department of Economic Development and Commerce, which will enumerate and secure the following tax benefits provided by Act 273 as contractual rights (i.e., regardless of future changes in Puerto Rico law) for a fifteen (15) year period:
 
(i)               to the IFE: 
 
·         a fixed 4% Puerto Rico income tax rate on the net income derived by the IFE from its Eligible IFE Activities; and
 ·         full property and municipal license tax exemptions on such activities. 
 
(ii)              to its shareholders: 
 

6% income tax rate on distributions
 to Puerto Rico resident shareholders of earnings and profits derived from
 the Eligible IFE Activities; and 
full Puerto Rico income tax exemption
 on such distributions to non-Puerto Rico resident shareholders. 

 
The primary purpose of IFEs is to attract Unites States and foreign investors to Puerto Rico. Consequently, Act 273 authorizes IFEs to engage in traditional banking and financial transactions, principally with non-residents of Puerto Rico. Furthermore, the scope of Eligible IFE Activities encompasses a wider variety of transactions than those previously authorized to IBEs. 
 
Act 187, as amended, enacted on November 17, 2015, requires the Commissioner to issue a Certificate of Compliance every two years in order to certify the compliance with law of companies organized under IBE Act 52.
 
As of the date of the issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, FirstBank IBE and FirstBank Overseas Corporation are operating under IBE Act 52.
 
Puerto Rico Income Taxes
 
Under the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 2011, as amended (the “2011 PR Code”), the Corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns and, thus, the Corporation is generally not entitled to utilize losses from one subsidiary to offset gains in another subsidiary. Accordingly, in order to obtain a tax benefit from a NOL, a particular subsidiary must be able to demonstrate sufficient taxable income within the applicable NOL carry-forward period. The 2011 PR Code allows entities organized as limited liability companies to perform an election to become a non-taxable “pass-through” entity and utilize losses to offset income from other “pass-through” entities, subject to certain limitations, with the remaining net income passing-through to its partner entities. The 2011 PR Code provides a dividend received deduction of 100% on dividends received from “controlled” subsidiaries subject to taxation in Puerto Rico and 85% on dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations.
 
On December 10, 2018, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into Law Act 257 to amend some of the provisions of the of 2011PR Code, as amended.  Act 257 introduces various changes to the current income tax regime in the case of individuals and corporations, and the sales and use taxes that are effective January 1, 2019. See “Significant Events Since the Beginning of 2018 – Puerto Rico Government Fiscal Situation, Government Actions and Exposure to Puerto Rico Government” discussion above for additional details about changes introduced by the Act 257. 
 
The Corporation has maintained an effective tax rate lower than the maximum statutory rate in Puerto Rico mainly by investing in government obligations and mortgage-backed securities exempt from U.S. and Puerto Rico income taxes and by doing business through an IBE unit of the Bank, and through the Bank’s subsidiary, FirstBank Overseas Corporation, whose interest income and gain on sales is exempt from Puerto Rico income taxation. The IBE and FirstBank Overseas Corporation were created under the International Banking Entity Act of Puerto Rico, which provides for total Puerto Rico tax exemption on net income derived by IBEs operating in Puerto Rico on the specific activities identified in the IBE Act.  An IBE that operates as a unit of a bank pays income taxes at the corporate standard rates to the extent that the IBE’s net income exceeds 20% of the bank’s total net taxable income.

United States Income Taxes
The Corporation is also subject to federal income tax on its income from sources within the United States and on any item of income that is, or is considered to be, effectively connected with the active conduct of a trade or business within the United States. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code provides for tax exemption of any portfolio interest received by a foreign corporation from sources within the United States; therefore, the Corporation is not subject to federal income tax on certain U.S. investments that qualify under the term “portfolio interest.”
On December 22, 2017, the United States president signed H.R.1, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts, effective January 1, 2018, which includes an overhaul of individual, business and international taxes and has affected our branch operations in the U.S. and the USVI. The bill includes measures reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax regime, changing business deductions and NOLs, and imposing a 15.5% tax on mandatory repatriation of liquid assets, a 10% tax on base erosion payments, and a minimum 10.5% tax on inclusion of global intangible low-tax income by U.S. shareholders, among other significant changes. The main provisions affecting our operations in the U.S. and the USVI include: the change in tax rate to 21%, the limitation to the amount certain financial institutions, including the Bank, may deduct for premiums paid to the FDIC, and changes in permanent differences, such as meals and entertainment deductions. Other significant provisions, such as the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, do not affect the Corporation’s U.S. and USVI branch operations since these operations’ receipts do not exceed the annual threshold of U.S. effectively connected gross receipts.
Insurance Operations Regulation
 FirstBank Insurance Agency is registered as an insurance agency with the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico and is subject to regulations issued by the Insurance Commissioner relating to, among other things, the licensing of employees and sales and solicitation and advertising practices, and by the Federal Reserve as to certain consumer protection provisions mandated by the GLB Act and its implementing regulations.
Mortgage Banking Operations
 In addition to FDIC and CFPB regulation, FirstBank is subject to the rules and regulations of the FHA, VA, FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, and HUD with respect to originating, processing, selling and servicing mortgage loans and the issuance and sale of mortgage-backed securities. Those rules and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines that include provisions for inspections and appraisals, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and fix maximum loan amounts, and, with respect to VA loans, fix maximum interest rates. Moreover, lenders such as FirstBank are required annually to submit audited financial statements to the FHA, VA, FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA and HUD and each regulatory entity has its own financial requirements. FirstBank’s affairs are also subject to supervision and examination by the FHA, VA, FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA and HUD at all times to assure compliance with applicable regulations, policies and procedures. Mortgage origination activities are subject to, among other requirements, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder that, among other things, prohibit discrimination and require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit terms and settlement costs. FirstBank is licensed by the Commissioner under the Puerto Rico Mortgage Banking Law, and, as such, is subject to regulation by the Commissioner, with respect to, among other things, licensing requirements and the establishment of maximum origination fees on certain types of mortgage loan products.
 Section 5 of the Puerto Rico Mortgage Banking Law requires the prior approval of the Commissioner for the acquisition of control of any mortgage banking institution licensed under such law. For purposes of the Puerto Rico Mortgage Banking Law, the term “control” means the power to direct or influence decisively, directly or indirectly, the management or policies of a mortgage banking institution. The Puerto Rico Mortgage Banking Law provides that a transaction that results in the holding of less than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of a mortgage banking institution shall not be considered a change in control.
