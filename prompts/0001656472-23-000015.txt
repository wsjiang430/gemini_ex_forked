Description of the Business
Overview
Cronos is an innovative global cannabinoid company committed to building disruptive intellectual property by advancing cannabis research, technology and product development. With a passion to responsibly elevate the consumer experience, Cronos is building an iconic brand portfolio. Cronos’ diverse international brand portfolio includes Spinach®, PEACE NATURALS® and Lord Jones®.
Strategy
Cronos seeks to create value for shareholders by focusing on four core strategic priorities:
•growing a portfolio of iconic brands that responsibly elevate the consumer experience;
•developing a diversified global sales and distribution network;
•establishing an efficient global supply chain; and
•creating and monetizing disruptive intellectual property.
Business Segments
Cronos reports through two segments: “United States” and “Rest of World.” These two segments represent the geographic regions in which the Company operates and the different product offerings within each geographic region. 
United States
Our U.S. operational subsidiaries (collectively, “Redwood”) manufacture, market and distribute U.S. hemp-derived cannabinoid products through e-commerce, retail and hospitality partner channels in the United States under the Lord Jones® brand.
Strategic Investment in PharmaCann, Inc.
On June 14, 2021, Cronos USA Holdings Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, purchased an option (the “PharmaCann Option”), with an exercise price of $0.0001 per share, to acquire an approximately 10.5% ownership stake in PharmaCann, Inc. (“PharmaCann”) on a fully diluted basis for total consideration of approximately $110.4 million. PharmaCann is a leading vertically integrated U.S. cannabis company that has a broad geographic footprint in the U.S. and has built an efficient, effective and scalable operating model. The PharmaCann Option exercise will be based upon various factors, including the status of U.S. federal cannabis legalization, as well as regulatory approvals, including in the states where PharmaCann operates that may be required upon exercise. Following the exercise of the PharmaCann Option, the Company and PharmaCann will enter into commercial agreements that would permit each party to offer its products through either party’s distribution channels.
On February 28, 2022, PharmaCann closed its merger transaction with LivWell Holdings, Inc. (“LivWell”) pursuant to which PharmaCann acquired LivWell (the “LivWell Transaction”). LivWell is a multi-state cannabis cultivation and retail leader based in Colorado. As a result of the LivWell Transaction, the Company’s ownership percentage in PharmaCann on a fully diluted basis decreased to approximately 6.4%. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s ownership percentage in PharmaCann on a fully diluted basis was approximately 6.3%. Under the terms of the Company’s investment in PharmaCann, the Company’s rights to nominate an observer or a director to the PharmaCann board of directors could be lost if the Company’s ownership drops below 6% on a fully diluted basis and it sells or transfers all or any portion of the option (subject to certain exceptions). As a result, further dilution could adversely affect the Company’s rights under the PharmaCann Option.

No U.S. Schedule I Cannabis-Related Activities 
On December 20, 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill was enacted in the U.S., removing U.S. hemp from the list of Schedule I controlled substances under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”), and on January 19, 2021, the USDA issued a final rule establishing a domestic U.S. hemp production regulatory program, effective March 2021. Though a number of states in the U.S. have authorized the cultivation, distribution or possession of U.S. Schedule I cannabis and U.S. Schedule I cannabis containing products to various degrees and subject to various requirements or conditions, U.S. Schedule I cannabis continues to be a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA. Therefore, the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and possession of U.S. Schedule I cannabis violates federal law in the U.S. unless a U.S. federal agency, such as the DEA, grants a registration for a specific activity, such as research, with U.S. Schedule I cannabis.
We do not engage in any activities related to U.S. Schedule I cannabis in the U.S. The Ginkgo Strategic Partnership contemplates the performance of licensed R&D activities in the U.S. in order to produce cultured cannabinoids, but such activities are conducted in compliance with all applicable laws regarding controlled substances.
Rest of World
The Rest of World operating segment is involved in the cultivation, manufacturing, and marketing of cannabis-derived products for medical and adult-use markets. 
In Canada, Cronos operates through two wholly owned license holders under the Cannabis Act (Canada) (the “Cannabis Act”), Peace Naturals Project Inc. (“Peace Naturals”), which has production facilities near Stayner, Ontario (the “Peace Naturals Campus”) and Thanos Holdings Ltd., known as Cronos Fermentation (“Cronos Fermentation”), which has a production facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Cronos has established two strategic joint ventures in Canada and Israel and holds approximately 10% of the issued capital of Vitura Health Limited (“Vitura”), formerly known as Cronos Australia Limited, which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange under the trading symbol “VIT.” Cronos seeks to export cannabis products to countries that permit the import of such products. 
Peace Naturals Campus / Cronos GrowCo
The production facilities at the Peace Naturals Campus and the production facilities of Cronos GrowCo are licensed by Health Canada under the Cannabis Act to engage in the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of dried cannabis flower, cannabis resin, cannabis seeds, cannabis plants, cannabis extracts, cannabis topicals and cannabis edibles, among other prescribed activities.
Cronos Fermentation
The production facility at Cronos Fermentation is licensed by Health Canada under the Cannabis Act to engage in the processing and distribution and sale of cannabis seeds and cannabis plants, among other prescribed activities, which includes the production of cultured cannabinoids. The facility also holds a license for Analytical Testing under the Cannabis Regulations.
Israel
In Israel, the Company operates under the IMC-GAP, IMC-GMP and IMC-GDP certifications required for the cultivation, production and marketing of dried flower, pre-rolls and oils in the Israeli medical market.
Operations Outside of Canada, Israel, and the U.S.
Cronos anticipates expanding in the geographic markets outside of Canada and the U.S. in which we currently participate and entering new geographic markets. By leveraging operational, manufacturing and regulatory expertise, quality standards and procedures and intellectual property, we believe that we are well-positioned to effectively access these markets. Subject to applicable regulatory approvals, strategic international business opportunities pursued by us could include:
•production, distribution, sales and marketing in jurisdictions that have passed legislation to legalize the production, distribution and possession of cannabis products at all relevant levels of government; and
•the export of cannabis products to markets that permit the import of such products.
We seek to conduct business only in jurisdictions where we believe it is legal to do so and where such operations remain compliant with our listing obligations with the TSX and Nasdaq. Determining whether a business activity is legal in a jurisdiction may require judgment since laws, rules, regulations and licenses may not be clear and legal interpretation and advice of counsel may vary. If a business activity in which we engage in any jurisdiction is determined to be illegal, we could be subject to fines, penalties, reputational harm, delisting from securities exchanges and material civil, criminal and regulatory litigation and proceedings or be enjoined from doing business in the applicable jurisdiction. See “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Regulation and Compliance - We operate in highly regulated sectors where the regulatory environment is rapidly developing, and we may not always succeed in complying fully with applicable regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where we carry on business.”

Joint Ventures/Strategic Investments
We have established two strategic joint ventures in Canada and Israel. Additionally, we hold approximately 10% of the issued capital of Vitura, which we account for as equity securities with a readily determinable fair value, and approximately 13.7% of the issued capital of NatuEra S.à.r.l. (“Natuera”), which we account for as equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, as of December 31, 2022.
Our ownership interest in each of our joint ventures is summarized in the table below.

Joint Venture | Jurisdiction | Ownership Interest(i)
Cronos Israel(ii) | Israel | 70%/90% 
Cronos GrowCo(iii) | Canada | 50% 

(i)    We define ownership interest as the proportionate share of net income to which we are entitled; equity interest may differ from ownership interest shown above. We consolidate the financial results of Cronos Israel and account for our other joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. See Note 1 “Background, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 3 “Investments” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
(ii)    A strategic joint venture with Kibbutz Gan Shmuel (“Gan Shmuel”), an Israeli agricultural collective settlement, for the production, manufacturing and global distribution of medical cannabis, consisting of a cultivation company (Cronos Israel G.S. Cultivation Ltd.), a manufacturing company (Cronos Israel G.S. Manufacturing Ltd.), a distribution company (Cronos Israel G.S. Store Ltd.) and a pharmacy company (Cronos Israel G.S. Pharmacy Ltd., collectively, “Cronos Israel”). We hold a 70% equity interest in the cultivation company and a 90% equity interest in each of the manufacturing, distribution and pharmacy companies.
(iii)    A strategic joint venture with a group of investors led by Bert Mucci (the “Greenhouse Partners”), a Canadian large-scale greenhouse operator. Each of Cronos and the Greenhouse Partners owns a 50% equity interest in Cronos GrowCo and has equal representation on its board of directors.

U.S. Hemp-derived Cannabinoid Brands
The Company operates Lord Jones®, a prestige U.S. hemp-derived cannabinoid brand in the U.S., for the adult consumer goods market.
Happy Dance® and PEACE+® were brands focused on the production and distribution of U.S. hemp-derived cannabinoid products. The Company no longer produces or distributes products under the Happy Dance® and PEACE+® brands.
Cronos Marketing Code
In 2021, Cronos released its Marketing Code, which is designed to responsibly move the emerging cannabis industry forward. Cronos believes that those below the legal age of consumption should not be targeted in an adult-use cannabis market. Cronos recognizes there is a clear need for standards.
The principles in the Cronos Marketing Code apply to all marketing activities of all Cronos brands globally and are communicated to all business partners in any work they do on the Company’s behalf. The Marketing Code represents Cronos’ commitment to responsible marketing standards. The code standards are:
•Our advertising will be targeted to adults.
•We will highlight responsible cannabis consumption and any people depicted in any imagery will be adults.
•Our brand websites and social media will be designed for adults.
•Our marketing events will be targeted to adults and will promote responsible cannabis consumption.
•We will provide our customers with facts and substantiate our claims.
Global Sales and Distribution - Principal Markets 
Cronos has developed a diversified global sales and distribution network. We have built a distribution footprint in Canada through the adult-use market, as well as a distribution footprint for U.S. hemp-derived cannabinoid products in the U.S. through e-commerce, retail and hospitality channels. We have also built a distribution channel for the Israeli medical market. Our PEACE NATURALS® medical cannabis products are sold in Canada through the Medical Cannabis by Shoppers Drug Mart platform.
United States Market and Distribution
Through Redwood, the Company manufactures, markets and distributes U.S. hemp-derived cannabinoid products through e-commerce, retail and hospitality partner channels in the U.S. under the Lord Jones® brand. Redwood’s products use high-quality cannabinoids from U.S. hemp extract that retains naturally occurring phytocannabinoids and terpenes found in the plant. We plan to use our resources to capitalize on market demand and to further create and scale U.S. hemp-derived cannabinoid products and brands. We do not engage in any commercial activities related to the cultivation, distribution or possession of U.S. Schedule I cannabis in the U.S.
Rest of World
Canadian Market and Distribution
•Medical Market. Our PEACE NATURALS® medical cannabis products are sold in Canada through the Medical Cannabis by Shoppers Drug Mart platform.
•Adult-Use. We currently sell dried flower, pre-rolls, vaporizers and edibles through our adult-use brand, Spinach®, to cannabis control authorities in all provinces of Canada and the Yukon territory, except Saskatchewan, where we sell to private-sector retailers, subject to the relevant province’s or territory’s product or other restrictions and requirements. As the Company’s supply chain grows, the Company continues to expand its portfolio of cannabis products for the existing markets in Canada.
Markets and Distribution Outside of Canada 
•Israel. Cronos Israel holds the IMC-GAP, IMC-GMP and IMC-GDP certifications required for the cultivation, production and marketing of dried flower, pre-rolls and oils in Israel. Cronos Israel distributes PEACE NATURALS® branded cannabis products to the Israeli medical cannabis market through pharmacies. See “- Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Israel.”
•Europe. We have previously distributed PEACE NATURALS® branded cannabis products in Germany.
•Australia and Asia-Pacific. Vitura holds an import license from the Australian Office of Drug Control to import PEACE NATURALS® branded cannabis products for sale in the Australian medical market under the terms of the relevant permits, which Vitura applies for on a case-by-case basis. On November 29, 2022, the shareholders of Cronos Australia approved a proposal to change the name of the company to “Vitura Health Limited” (the “CAU Name Change”), which change became effective on February 6, 2023. On December 2, 2022, in connection with the CAU Name Change, Vitura and the Company mutually agreed to terminate the intellectual property license that granted Vitura the right to use certain intellectual property of the Company, including, but not limited to, the “Cronos” name and the PEACE NATURALS® brand. Vitura has 180 days following the date of termination to cease all usage of the Company’s intellectual property. Vitura did not import PEACE NATURALS® branded cannabis products from the Company during 2022.

We continue to seek new international distribution channels in jurisdictions that have legalized the production, distribution and possession of cannabis products at all relevant levels of government.
Global Supply Chain
Cronos is focused on establishing an efficient global supply chain by seeking to develop industry-leading methodologies and best practices at Cronos Fermentation and the Peace Naturals Campus and leveraging this expertise to create beneficial production partnerships. We plan to continue to develop a global supply chain, which will employ a combination of wholly owned production facilities, third party suppliers and global production partnerships, all of which will support the manufacturing of cannabinoid-based consumer goods. 
United States
In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into contract manufacturing agreements with suppliers of our products. We may supply these third-party manufacturers with U.S. hemp-derived cannabinoids or infused bulk product, and other inputs such as packaging that we source from other third-party suppliers. The contract manufacturers supply any other necessary ingredients to manufacture products using our formulas and fill and package our finished products. Our contract manufacturing and supply agreements generally do not require us to purchase minimum quantities of materials or products.
In producing our supplement products, we source our ingredients from our suppliers on an ongoing as-needed basis. We have not entered into any contracts that obligate us to purchase a minimum quantity or exclusively from any supplier. Our supplements are manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”), which we employ at our facility in Los Angeles, California.
Rest of World 
Canadian Supply Chain
•Facilities at Cronos Fermentation and Peace Naturals Campus. Cronos Fermentation and the Peace Naturals Campus are licensed for cannabis production and the manufacturing of certain cannabis products. Cronos Fermentation engages in R&D to produce high-quality cultured cannabinoids at commercial scale. In addition to manufacturing cultured cannabinoids, scientists at the facility create cannabinoid product formulations, and engage in product development. The Peace Naturals Campus is engaged in processing, finishing, packaging and shipping activities, as well as R&D activities, including cannabinoid product formulation, product development, tissue culture and micro propagation. The GMP certificate issued under relevant European Economic Area GMP directives by the national competent authority of Germany was retracted in 2022 due to the announcement of the closure of the Peace Naturals Campus.
•Cronos GrowCo. The Cronos GrowCo production facility is licensed for cannabis production and the manufacturing of certain cannabis products. Under its current licenses, Cronos GrowCo is permitted to sell certain cannabis products to other license holders in the wholesale channel, as well as to provincial cannabis control authorities. Cronos GrowCo holds Global GAP and ICANN GAP certifications (equivalent to IMC-GAP) for the export of dried cannabis to Israel.
•Third Party Supply and Manufacturing Agreements. In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into spot market purchase agreements and supply agreements with suppliers of dried cannabis and other cannabis products. Our supply agreements, for the most part, do not obligate us to purchase minimum quantities of products and generally contain provisions permitting cancellation of orders or termination on notice. We also enter into contract manufacturing agreements with other license holders for certain manufacturing and processing services related to our products.
Supply Chain Outside of Canada 
•Cronos Israel. Cronos Israel holds the IMC-GAP, IMC-GMP and IMC-GDP certifications required for the cultivation, production, distribution, and marketing of dried flower, pre-rolls and oils in Israel. Cronos Israel distributes PEACE NATURALS® branded cannabis products to the Israeli medical market. See “- Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Israel.”
Major Customers
Major customers are customers for which sales equaled or exceeded 10% of our consolidated net revenues for the year. We had three major customers, Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation, Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Commission, and Société Québécoise du Cannabis (the “SQDC”), which accounted for approximately 28%, 17% and 10%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues, before excises taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2022. We mitigate credit risk through verification of the customers’ liquidity prior to the authorization of material transactions.

Government Contracts
In Canada, we sell cannabis products to cannabis control authorities in all provinces of Canada and the Yukon territory, except for Saskatchewan (where we sell to private-sector retailers), where each such cannabis control authority is the sole wholesale distributor and in certain provinces, the sole retailer, of cannabis products. We sell these products to the various cannabis control authorities under supply agreements that are subject to terms that allow for renegotiation of sale prices and termination at the election of the applicable cannabis control authority. In particular, the cannabis control authorities have in the past and may in the future choose to stop purchasing our products, may change the prices at which they purchase our products, may return our products to us and, in certain circumstances, may cancel purchase orders at any time including after products have been shipped. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had approximately $77.6 million in sales to cannabis control authorities in Canada.
Research and Development Activities and Intellectual Property
Ginkgo 
The collaboration and license agreement between Ginkgo and the Company (the “Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement”) has enabled us to produce certain cultured cannabinoids at commercial scale at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional cultivation practices. The Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement was amended in June 2021 to enable accelerated commercialization of such cultured cannabinoids, ultimately resulting in the Company’s launching of its first cultured cannabinoid product containing cannabigerol (“CBG”) in the second half of 2021. These cultured cannabinoid molecules are identical to those produced by plants grown using traditional cultivation but are created by leveraging the power of biological manufacturing via fermentation. These cultured cannabinoids include rare cannabinoids that are difficult to produce at high purity and scale through traditional cultivation.
Cronos is able to produce large volumes of these cultured cannabinoids from custom yeast strains, as they are successfully created through the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership, by leveraging existing fermentation infrastructure at Cronos Fermentation in Winnipeg, Manitoba without incurring significant capital expenditures to build new cultivation and extraction facilities.
The Ginkgo Strategic Partnership contemplates the performance of licensed R&D activities in the U.S. in order to produce cultured cannabinoids, and such activities are to be conducted in compliance with all applicable laws regarding controlled substances. We intend to produce and distribute the target cannabinoids globally, where permitted by applicable law, and have received confirmation from Health Canada that this method of production is permitted under the Cannabis Act. 
Ginkgo has filed certain patent applications pertaining to biosynthesis of cannabinoids to protect the intellectual property developed as part of the research progressing under the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership. Under the partnership, Cronos is the exclusive licensee of the intellectual property covered by the patent applications for the target cannabinoids. 
Cronos Fermentation 
Cronos Fermentation is a GMP-standard fermentation and manufacturing facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The state-of-the-art facility includes fully equipped laboratories covering microbiology, organic and analytical chemistry, quality control and method development as well as two large-scale microbial fermentation production areas, chemical manufacturing production areas, three downstream processing plants, and bulk product and packaging capabilities. The facility provides the fermentation and manufacturing capabilities we need in order to capitalize on the progress underway with Ginkgo, by enabling us to produce the target cannabinoids contemplated under the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement at commercial scale with high quality and high purity.
The Company is prioritizing rare cannabinoids, such as CBG, CBC and THCV, over common cannabinoids, such as THC and CBD, and has been sequencing commercial production and subsequent product launches based upon this approach. The Company achieved its first two equity milestones in 2021, and an additional three equity milestones in 2022. The achievement of equity milestones for the remaining target cannabinoids generally will occur sequentially based on Ginkgo’s ability to produce such target cannabinoids as contemplated under the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement.
Competitive Conditions
Competitive Conditions in the United States
We face competition in all aspects of our business in the U.S. hemp market. In addition to numerous small companies and brands, we compete with larger, national companies that may have larger distribution capabilities with more developed and efficient supply chain operations. The principal factors on which we compete with other U.S. hemp brands are product quality, innovation, intellectual property, brand recognition and price. In the second quarter of 2022, the Company began a phased exit of the wholesale beauty category in the U.S. business to focus the portfolio on adult-use product formats within the direct-to-consumer channel. We believe the Company’s strong capitalization resulting from the Altria Investment, along with the Lord Jones® brand recognition and differentiation in the U.S. hemp retail channel, will enable us to provide better quality consumer products, grow our U.S. hemp business and strengthen our market position in the U.S. However, rapidly evolving and developing federal and state regulatory frameworks affect all areas of our business and could result in our inability to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. See “U.S. Hemp Regulatory Framework” for further information on regulatory framework on U.S. hemp.
Table of Contents

Competitive Conditions in Rest of World
Competitive Conditions in Canada
We face competition in all aspects of our business in the Canadian adult-use and medical markets. As the demand for cannabis increases as a result of the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Canada under the Cannabis Act, we believe that new competitors will continue to enter the market. 
The principal factors on which we compete with other Canadian license holders are product quality, innovation, intellectual property, brand recognition and price. We believe the Company’s strong capitalization resulting from the Altria Investment, along with the Spinach® brand recognition and differentiation in the Canadian adult-use market, will enable us to provide better quality consumer products, grow our Canadian business and strengthen our market position in Canada. However, a rapidly evolving and stringent federal regulatory framework affects all areas of our business. See “—Regulatory Framework in Canada” for further information on the regulatory framework applicable to our Canadian business.
We also face competition from illegal market participants that are unlicensed and unregulated. As these illegal market participants do not comply with the regulations governing the cannabis industry, their operations may also have significantly lower costs. Any inability of the Canadian federal or provincial law enforcement authorities to enforce existing laws prohibiting the unlicensed cultivation and sale of cannabis and cannabis-based products could result in the perpetuation of the illegal market for cannabis.
Competitive Conditions in Europe and Israel
We face competition when entering new markets. The principal factors on which we compete are product quality, innovation, intellectual property, brand recognition, price and physician familiarity. We believe we are positioned to enter certain markets in Europe in a meaningful way while continuing to operate and penetrate the markets we currently serve, such as in Israel, due to our strong capitalization resulting from the Altria Investment, extensive experience and expertise in the highly regulated cannabis industry in Canada, which can be leveraged when entering new markets or growing existing operations, and strong partnerships with local distributors. We believe these factors will enable us to develop greater market penetration, provide a greater variety of quality consumer products and enter into new markets and strengthen our existing market position in Europe and Israel. However, a patchwork of regulatory frameworks and federal regulations in these various regions also affects our ability to compete in emerging markets as evolving regulations and federal frameworks have the potential to affect all areas of our business.
Altria Strategic Investment
Altria Investment and Investor Rights Agreement
As of December 31, 2022, Altria beneficially owned 41% of our common shares and had the right to acquire additional common shares under its pre-emptive and top-up rights as discussed under “Pre-Emptive Rights and Top-Up Rights” below.
Warrant
Prior to December 16, 2022, Altria had the right to acquire up to an additional 84,243,223 of our common shares at a per share exercise price of C$19.00 (the “Warrant”). On December 16, 2022, Altria notified the Company that its wholly owned subsidiary, Altria Summit LLC, irrevocably relinquished the Warrant and all rights that it may have held in the Warrant or any common shares underlying the Warrant for no consideration. The voluntary irrevocable relinquishment of the Warrant does not affect any rights of Altria under the Investor Rights Agreement between the Company and Altria, dated March 8, 2019 (the “Investor Rights Agreement”), and Altria continues to beneficially own 156,573,537 of our common shares.
Investor Rights Agreement

whole number) based on the percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group at the relevant time.
Approval Rights
The Investor Rights Agreement also grants Altria, until the Altria Group beneficially owns less than 10% of our issued and outstanding common shares, approval rights over certain transactions that may be undertaken by us. We have agreed that, among other things, we will not (and will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause our affiliates not to), without the prior written consent of Altria:
•consolidate or merge into or with another person or enter into any similar business combination;
•acquire any shares or similar equity interests, instruments convertible into or exchangeable for shares or similar equity interests, assets, business or operations with an aggregate value of more than C$100,000,000, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions;
•sell, transfer, cause to be transferred, exclusively license, lease, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of our or any of our significant subsidiaries’ assets, business or operations in the aggregate with a value of more than C$60,000,000;
•except as required by applicable law, make any changes to our policy with respect to the declaration and payment of any dividends on our common shares;
•subject to certain exceptions, enter into any contract or other agreement, arrangement, or understanding with respect to, or consummate, any transaction or series of related transactions between us or any of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any related parties, on the other hand, involving consideration or any other transfer of value required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated pursuant to the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”); or
•engage in the production, cultivation, advertisement, marketing, promotion, sale or distribution of cannabis or any Related Products and Services (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., where such activity is prohibited by applicable law as of the date of the Investor Rights Agreement (subject to certain limitations).
Exclusivity Covenant
Pursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, until the earlier of:
•the six-month anniversary of the date on which the Altria Group beneficially owns less than 10% of our issued and outstanding common shares; and
•the six-month anniversary of the termination of the Investor Rights Agreement,
Altria has agreed to make us its exclusive partner for pursuing cannabis opportunities throughout the world (subject to certain limited exceptions).
Pre-Emptive Rights and Top-Up Rights
Pursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement and provided the Altria Group continues to beneficially own at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Altria has a right to purchase, directly or indirectly by another member of the Altria Group, upon the occurrence of certain issuances of common shares by us (including issuances of common shares to Ginkgo under the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement (each, a “Ginkgo Issuance”)) (each, a “Triggering Event”) and subject to obtaining the necessary approvals, up to such number of our common shares issuable in connection with the Triggering Event which will, when added to our common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group immediately prior to the Triggering Event, result in the Altria Group beneficially owning the same percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares that the Altria Group beneficially owned immediately prior to the Triggering Event (in each case, calculated on a non-diluted basis). The price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of these pre-emptive rights will be, subject to certain limited exceptions, the same price per common share at which the common shares are sold in the relevant Triggering Event; provided that if the consideration paid in connection with any such issuance is non-cash, the price per common share that would have been received had such common shares been issued for cash consideration will be determined by an independent committee (acting reasonably and in good faith); provided further that the price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its pre-emptive rights in connection with a Ginkgo Issuance will be C$16.25 per common share.
In addition to (and without duplication of) the aforementioned pre-emptive rights, the Investor Rights Agreement provides Altria with top-up rights, exercisable on a quarterly basis, whereby, subject to obtaining the necessary approvals and for so long as the Altria Group beneficially owns at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Altria has the right to subscribe for such number of common shares in connection with any Top-Up Securities (as defined below) that we may, from time to time, issue after the date of the Investor Rights Agreement, as will, when added to the common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group prior to such issuance, result in the Altria Group beneficially owning the same percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares that the Altria Group beneficially owned immediately prior to such issuance. “Top-Up Securities” means any of our common shares issued:
Table of Contents

•on the exercise, conversion or exchange of our convertible securities issued prior to the date of the Investor Rights Agreement or on the exercise, conversion or exchange of our convertible securities issued after the date of the Investor Rights Agreement in compliance with the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, in each case, excluding any of our convertible securities owned by any member of the Altria Group;
•pursuant to any share incentive plan of the Company;
•on the exercise of any right granted by us pro rata to all shareholders to purchase additional common shares and/or other securities of the Company (other than a right issued in a rights offering in which Altria had the right to participate);
•in connection with bona fide bank debt, equipment financing or non-equity interim financing transactions with our lenders, in each case, with an equity component; or
•in connection with bona fide acquisitions (including acquisitions of assets or rights under a license or otherwise), mergers or similar business combination transactions or joint ventures undertaken and completed by us, 
in each case, other than (A) common shares issued pursuant to Altria’s pre-emptive right and (B) common shares issued pursuant to the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement.
The price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its top-up rights will be, subject to certain limited exceptions, the volume-weighted average price of our common shares on the TSX for the 10 full trading days preceding such exercise by Altria; provided that the price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its top-up rights in connection with the issuance of common shares pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants that were outstanding on the date of closing of the Altria Investment will be C$16.25 per common share without any set off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding.
Standstill Covenant
The Altria Group is permitted to acquire our common shares in the open market upon the falling away of the standstill covenant under the Investor Rights Agreement. The Investor Rights Agreement specifies that the standstill covenant falls away on the expiry or termination of the Warrant.
Registration Rights
The Investor Rights Agreement provides Altria with the right, subject to certain limitations and to the extent permitted by applicable law, to require us to use reasonable commercial efforts to file a prospectus under applicable securities laws and/or a registration statement, qualifying our common shares held by Altria for distribution in Canada and/or the U.S. In addition, the Investor Rights Agreement provides Altria with the right to require us to include our common shares held by Altria in any proposed distribution of common shares in Canada and/or the U.S. by us for our own account.
Commercial Arrangements
In connection with the Altria Investment, we and Altria have entered into certain commercial arrangements (the “Commercial Arrangements”), pursuant to which Altria provides us with consulting services on matters which may include R&D, marketing, advertising and brand management, government relations and regulatory affairs, finance, tax planning, logistics and other corporate administrative matters. The services under the Commercial Arrangements are provided on customary terms and for a services fee payable by us that is equal to Altria’s reasonably allocated costs plus 5%.
Protection of Intangible Assets 
The ownership and protection of our intellectual property rights is a significant aspect of our future success. Currently, we rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information. We seek to protect our intellectual property by strategically seeking and obtaining registered protection where appropriate, developing and implementing standard operating procedures to protect inventions, germplasm, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information and entering into agreements with parties that have access to our inventions, germplasm, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information, such as our partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, to protect confidentiality and ownership. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our inventions, germplasm, trade secrets, trademarks, technical know-how and proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
In addition, we have sought trademark protection in many jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia, the U.S., China, Israel and Europe. Our ability to obtain registered trademark protection for cannabis-related goods and services, in particular for cannabis itself, may be limited in certain countries outside of Canada. For example, in the U.S., registered federal trademark protection is only available for goods and services that can be lawfully used in interstate commerce; the PTO is not currently approving any trademark applications for U.S. Schedule I cannabis, or certain goods containing U.S. hemp-derived CBD (such as dietary supplements and food) until the FDA provides clearer guidance on the regulation of such products. In Europe, trademarks cannot be obtained for products that are “contrary to public policy or accepted principles of morality.” Accordingly, our ability to obtain intellectual property rights and enforce intellectual property rights against third party uses of similar trademarks may be limited in certain jurisdictions.

Regulatory Framework in the U.S.
U.S. Hemp Regulatory Framework 
We derive a portion of our revenues from the manufacture, marketing and distribution of U.S. hemp-derived supplement and cosmetic consumer products through e-commerce, retail and hospitality channels in certain states in the U.S. All U.S. hemp-derived products produced and sold by us constitute “hemp” (i) under the 2018 Farm Bill and (ii) the applicable state-law equivalent in all states in which we produce and sell such U.S. hemp-derived products. The 2018 Farm Bill was enacted in the U.S. on December 20, 2018. Prior to this enactment, cannabis was scheduled as a controlled substance (marijuana) under the CSA with limited exemptions based on the portion of the cannabis plant. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, removed U.S. hemp (which is defined in the 2018 Farm Bill as “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis”) and its derivatives, extracts and cannabinoids, including CBD, derived from hemp, from the definition of “marijuana” in the CSA, thereby removing U.S. hemp and its derivatives as controlled substances. The 2018 Farm Bill also amended the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to allow for production and sale of U.S. hemp and its derivatives in the U.S.
Table of Contents

The 2018 Farm Bill tasked the USDA with promulgating regulations in relation to the cultivation and production of U.S. hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill also directed the USDA to promulgate federal regulations that would apply to the production of U.S. hemp in every state that does not put forth a state U.S. hemp plan for approval by the USDA.
The USDA’s final rule establishes a federal licensing plan for regulating U.S. hemp producers in states that do not have their own USDA-approved plans. In the absence of a state plan, U.S. hemp producers will be subject to regulation directly by the USDA unless the state prohibits U.S. hemp production. Additionally, the final rule includes requirements for maintaining information on the land where U.S. hemp is produced, testing U.S. hemp for THC levels, disposing of plants with more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry-weight basis and licensing for U.S. hemp producers. The USDA’s final rule requires hemp producers to use a laboratory that is registered with the DEA, although the USDA is delaying enforcement of this requirement until December 31, 2022. The final rule also includes provisions for producers to dispose or remediate violative hemp plants without the use of a DEA-registered reverse distributor or law enforcement.
States may adopt regulatory schemes that impose more stringent levels of regulation and costs on the production of U.S. hemp. Moreover, the 2018 Farm Bill provides that its provisions do not pre-empt or limit state laws that regulate the production of U.S. hemp. Accordingly, some states may choose to restrict or prohibit some or all U.S. hemp production or sales within the state. Variances in states’ laws and regulations on U.S. hemp are likely to persist.
Further, each state has discretion to develop and implement its own laws and regulations governing the manufacturing, composition, marketing, labeling and sale of U.S. hemp products, which has created a patchwork of different regulatory schemes applicable to such products.
Under the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA has retained authority over the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act-regulated products (e.g., drugs, food, dietary supplements and cosmetics) containing U.S. hemp and U.S. hemp-derived ingredients, including CBD and other cannabinoids. Moreover, states have retained regulatory authority through their own analogues to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FFDCA”), and the states may diverge from the federal treatment of the use of U.S. hemp as, or in, food, dietary supplements or cosmetic products.
The FDA has consistently taken the position that CBD, whether derived from U.S. hemp or U.S. Schedule I cannabis, is prohibited from use as an ingredient in food and dietary supplements. This stems from its interpretation of the exclusionary clauses in the FFDCA because CBD has been approved as a prescription drug and is the subject of substantial clinical investigations as a drug, which have been made public. The exclusionary clauses under the FFDCA provide that a substance that has been approved or has been subject to substantial clinical investigations as a drug may not be used in a food or dietary supplement, unless the substance was first marketed in a food or dietary supplement prior to the initiation of substantial clinical investigations of the substance as a drug. The exclusionary clause does not apply to cosmetics. Cosmetics containing CBD could be viewed as drug products by the FDA if disease claims are made, or if the FDA determines the use of CBD in the product has a structure or function effect on the body (i.e., a drug effect).
To date, the FDA has not issued regulations that elaborate on the exclusionary clauses and the FDA has not taken any enforcement action in the courts asserting a violation of the exclusionary clauses. To date, the FDA has issued a number of warning letters to companies unlawfully marketing CBD products. In many of these cases, the manufacturers made unsubstantiated claims about the product being able to treat medical conditions (e.g., cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, opioid withdrawal, anxiety and COVID-19) and had not obtained drug approvals. Others were issued to companies marketing CBD products as dietary supplements despite those products which contain CBD not meeting the definition of a dietary supplement, adding CBD to human and animal foods and marketing CBD products for infants and children and other vulnerable populations, selling CBD products that people may confuse for traditional foods or beverages and that may result in unintentional consumption or overconsumption of CBD, and selling unapproved animal drugs containing CBD that are intended for use in food-producing animals. Some of these letters were co-signed with the FTC and cited the companies for making claims about the efficacy of CBD and other ingredients which were not substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. In December 2020, the FTC announced it had entered into settlement agreements with six companies marketing CBD products including oils, gummies, creams, and others with deceptive health claims about serious health conditions. The settlements included monetary penalties ranging from $20,000 to $85,000. The FTC announced another such enforcement action and settlement in May 2021, ordering consumer redress of over $30,000. The FDA has also issued warning letters to dietary supplement manufacturers objecting to CBD supplements on the basis that CBD was not a permissible dietary supplement ingredient.
The FDA periodically updates its “Consumer Update” on CBD. Through these Consumer Updates, the FDA has noted that it has approved only one CBD product, a prescription drug product to treat three rare, severe forms of epilepsy. The FDA has also stated that it is illegal to market CBD by adding it to a food or labeling it as a dietary supplement, that the FDA has seen only limited data about CBD safety and these data point to real risks that need to be considered before taking CBD for any reason and that some CBD products are being marketed with unproven medical claims and are of unknown quality.
The FDA has stated that it recognizes the potential opportunities and significant interest in drug and other consumer products containing CBD, is committed to evaluating the agency’s regulatory policies related to CBD and has established a dedicated internal working group, the Cannabis Product Committee, to explore potential pathways for various types of CBD products to be lawfully marketed. The FDA held a public hearing in May 2019 to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. The rules and 
Table of Contents

regulations and enforcement in this area continue to evolve and develop. In July 2020, the FDA sent to the White House Office of Management and Budget (the “OMB”) for review a draft guidance, “Cannabidiol Enforcement Policy,” the details of which were not made public. This guidance remained under review at the OMB until January 2021, when it was withdrawn by the FDA as a part of the regulatory moratorium Executive Order issued by President Biden. On January 26, 2023, the FDA stated its views publicly that a new regulatory pathway for CBD is needed and it is prepared to work with Congress to create such a pathway. The timeline for further CBD policy development remains uncertain while the administration and the FDA face competing regulatory priorities.
Furthermore, with respect to Company’s development of CBG and other cannabinoids and additional cannabinoid product lines, the FDA has provided no guidance as to how cannabinoids other than CBD (such as CBG) are to be regulated under the FFDCA, and it is unclear at this time how such potential regulation could affect the results of the operations or prospects of the Company or this product line.
For more information regarding certain risks facing our business in connection with the U.S. hemp regulatory framework in the U.S., see the section below entitled “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Regulation and Compliance - Risks Related to U.S. Regulations and Compliance.”
U.S. Cosmetics Regulation
On December 29, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022, which significantly expands the FDA’s enforcement authorities over cosmetics products and imposes new obligations on the cosmetics industry, including requirements relating to GMP, labeling, safety substantiation, facility registration and product listing with the FDA, adverse event reporting, recordkeeping, among others. Under the new legislation, the FDA is required over the next several years to issue additional regulations and reports to clarify requirements. Most enforcement of requirements under the new legislation will not go into effect until a year or later from the date of enactment; however, we expect that regulation of our cosmetic products in the U.S. will become increasingly complex, and compliance with regulatory requirements may take significant additional resources.
Regulatory Framework in Canada
Licenses and Regulatory Framework
On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations (the “Cannabis Regulations”) came into force. The Cannabis Regulations establish six classes of licenses: 
•cultivation;
•processing;
•sale for medical purposes;
•analytical testing;
•research; and
•cannabis drug.
The Cannabis Regulations also create subclasses for cultivation licenses (standard cultivation, micro-cultivation and nursery) and processing licenses (standard processing and micro-processing). Different licenses and each sub-class therein carry differing rules and requirements that are intended to be proportional to the public health and safety risks posed by each category and sub-class.
Federal Regime
The Cannabis Act provides a licensing and permitting scheme for, among other things, the cultivation, processing, testing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale, possession and disposal of adult-use cannabis, implemented by regulations promulgated under the Cannabis Act. The Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations include, among other things, strict specifications for the plain packaging and labeling and analytical testing of all cannabis products as well as stringent physical and personnel security requirements for all federally licensed cultivation, processing and sales sites.
On October 17, 2019, the Regulations Amending the Cannabis Regulations (New Classes of Cannabis) (the “Further Regulations”) came into effect. The Further Regulations amend the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations to, among other things, permit the production and sale of cannabis extracts (including concentrates), cannabis topicals and cannabis edibles, in addition to dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants and cannabis seeds for parties holding the appropriate licenses. The Cannabis Regulations set out certain requirements for the sale of cannabis products, including limiting the THC content and serving size of certain product forms.

Health Canada allows license holders to export cannabis products with appropriate export permits. Export permits issued by Health Canada are specific to each shipment and may only be obtained for medical or scientific purposes. To apply for a permit to export cannabis, a license holder must submit significant information to Health Canada including information about the substance to be exported (including description, intended use, quantity) and the importer. As part of the application, applicants are also generally required to provide a copy of the import permit issued by a competent authority in the jurisdiction of final destination and to make a declaration to Health Canada that the shipment does not contravene the laws of the jurisdiction of the final destination or any country of transit or transshipment. 
The Cannabis Act requires the federal government to conduct a review of the Cannabis Act after three years, which commenced in September 2022. The scope of this statutory review includes, among other things, consideration of (i) the administration and operation of the Cannabis Act, (ii) the impact of the Cannabis Act on public health, (iii) the health and consumption habits of young persons, (iv) the impact of cannabis on indigenous persons and communities and (v) the impact of the cultivation of cannabis plants in a dwelling-house. The report resulting from the statutory review may recommend and/or lead to the amendment, removal or addition of provisions in or to the Cannabis Act which could adversely affect our business.
In addition to the current medical and adult-use regimes under the Cannabis Act, Health Canada has also been considering the implementation of a cannabis health product regime for products with potential therapeutic uses that would not require practitioner oversight. Between June and September 2019, Health Canada held a public consultation titled “Potential Market for Cannabis Health Products (CHPs) that would not Require Practitioner Oversight”. The consultation sought feedback from Canadians on the kinds of cannabis health products they would be interested in if such products were made available in Canada. A summary report of the consultation results was published by Health Canada in September 2020. Given the results of the consultation, Health Canada has indicated that it intends to obtain external scientific advice on the appropriate evidence standards required to demonstrate safety, efficacy and quality in cannabis health products, with the information it gathers informing the next steps on a potential implementation of a cannabis health product regime.
In June 2021, Health Canada opened a consultation into the use of flavors in inhaled cannabis extracts as it claims that the availability of flavors is one of the factors that contributes to the increase in cannabis vaping in youth and young adults. As part of this consultation, Health Canada released proposed regulations that contemplate restricting the production, sale, promotion, packaging and labelling of inhaled cannabis extracts from having a flavor, other than the flavor of cannabis. The proposed amendments would apply equally to inhaled cannabis extracts sold for medical and non-medical purposes. The proposed amendments were pre-published in June 2021 and the consultation period closed in September 2021. No expected in-force date has been publicly announced.
Provincial and Territorial Developments 
While the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation by the Canadian federal government of, among other things, the commercial production of cannabis and the sale of medical cannabis, the various provinces and territories of Canada regulate certain aspects of adult-use cannabis, including but not limited to distribution, sale, minimum age requirements and places where cannabis can be consumed.
The governments of each Canadian province and territory have implemented regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes which continue to evolve over time. Most provinces and territories have announced a minimum age for possession and consumption of 19 years old, except for Québec and Alberta, where the minimum age is 21 and 18, respectively. In addition, provinces and territories may impose additional licensing requirements and restrictions on sales, distribution and promotion which are more stringent than those at the federal level. For example, the SQDC, the exclusive distributor of cannabis in the province and the sole retail and online vendor in Québec, does not permit cannabis vaporizers or other high THC non-edible cannabis products to be sold through its channels. The SQDC has also placed significant restrictions on the types of edibles that may be sold through its channels, prohibiting edibles that are sweet, confectionary, dessert, chocolate or any other product attractive to persons under 21 years of age. Similarly, the Prince Edward Island Cannabis Management Corporation does not allow cannabis vaporizers to be sold through its channels.
Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Israel
In Israel, cannabis is subject to the Israeli Dangerous Drugs Ordinance [New Version], 5733 – 1973, and its sale and use are prohibited unless applicable licenses have been obtained. Licenses to cultivate, produce, possess and use cannabis for medical or research purposes in Israel are granted by the Israel Medical Cannabis Agency within the Israeli Ministry of Health (the “Yakar” and the “Israeli MOH”, respectively). Patients also must obtain licenses either directly from physicians who have been authorized to grant patient licenses or from the Yakar following a request from the patient’s physician in order to purchase and consume medical cannabis. 
Table of Contents

In January 2019, the Israeli government approved, in principle, the export from Israel of medical cannabis products that meet applicable quality standards under the strict supervision of the Israeli authorities. Only products that can be directly marketed to patients (including smoking products, oils, and vaporizer products) may be exported, and only to those countries that have signed the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and that have explicitly approved the import of cannabis. The export of plant substances, including seeds and tissue cultures, is not permitted. In October 2020, the Israeli MOH initiated a pilot program in which certain medical cannabis companies were permitted to export their products, and the Yakar issued guidelines relating to the export of medical cannabis products. These guidelines set forth the process and conditions for obtaining an export license, which can only be issued to an applicant already holding a valid Yakar license.
In December 2021, the Director General of the Israeli MOH announced the appointment of a committee (the “CBD Committee”) intended to examine the possibility of excluding CBD from being considered a “dangerous drug” under the Israeli Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (the “Ordinance”). In February 2022, the CBD Committee published its recommendations. The CBD Committee concluded that it would be advisable to exclude CBD from the Ordinance and to allow CBD use, other than in food and cosmetics products, provided that the aggregate concentration of THC does not exceed 0.2%. The CBD Committee further recommended that during the next two years, CBD components not be approved as a component in food, food supplements, and cosmetics and that this issue be re-examined by a committee designated by the Israeli MOH. In March 2022, the Israeli MOH adopted the conclusions of the CBD Committee and published a draft order for public comments which excludes CBD from the Ordinance while setting the threshold of aggregate concentration of THC (or any structural derivative of THC) in any product, to 0.3%. Cosmetics and food products be handled by specific regulations in such fields. As of January 2023, no final order was issued, and CBD has yet to be excluded from the Ordinance.
On January 31, 2022, the Economic Affairs Committee of the Israeli Parliament held a discussion regarding the adverse effect on the local cannabis industry of significant import of medical cannabis. The discussion was concluded with a request to the Israeli MOH to study the matter and consider banning medical cannabis import until a balance is reached in the market between the import and export of medical cannabis. The Israeli MOH has not yet publicly issued a study on the matter.
In July 2022, a committee appointed by the Director General of the Israeli MOH concluded that it would be advisable to reform the medical cannabis regulatory framework by transitioning from the grant of personal patient licenses to the issuance of prescriptions available through public healthcare services. In August 2022, the new regulations adopting this reform (the “Reform Regulations”) were presented for public comments. The Reform Regulations propose to amend the Ordinance to allow medical cannabis to be prescribed by trained and certified physicians and to be held and distributed by pharmacies. The Reform Regulations will enter into effect 180 days following the adoption by the Israeli Parliament of the HMOs collection plan. As of January 2023, the Reform Regulations have not yet been adopted and are not yet in effect.
In June 2022, 11 cannabis manufacturers (including Cronos Israel G.S Manufacturing Ltd.) (the “Petitioners”) filed an administrative petition to the District Court in Jerusalem regarding the Yakar’s decision to issue a constructive license (i.e., a license for dealing with medical cannabis, without a direct contact with the drug, such as brokering medical cannabis transactions) (the “Constructive License”). The Petitioners claim that the procedure and requirements for other licenses (e.g., for cultivation or production), granted by the Yakar, are unreasonably more stringent than those of the Constructive License. On January 5, 2023, the District Court in Jerusalem ordered the Israeli MOH to stop the issuance of Constructive Licenses, for 60 days, and to formulate a clear policy regarding the issuance of such Constructive Licenses. On February 12, 2023, the director general of the Yakar published a decision regarding the Constructive Licenses, in response to the District Court’s order. The decision clarifies the Yakar’s authority to grant Constructive Licenses for the import/export of medical cannabis.
Cronos Israel Licenses 
Cronos Israel maintains the following certificates and corresponding permits: (1) full Good Agricultural Practices (“GAP”) certification, including a permit to propagate and cultivate at the full capacity of the greenhouse; and (2) GMP and Good Distribution Practices (“GDP”) certificates and permits to produce and distribute dried flower, cannabis oils and pre-rolls.
Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Other Jurisdictions
We and our joint venture partners and strategic investments are subject to comprehensive and evolving regulations in each jurisdiction we and they operate. All aspects of the production, manufacture and distribution of cannabis products are regulated and subject to licensing regimes. These regulations and licensing regimes vary by jurisdiction and we, our joint venture partners and strategic investments spend significant time, effort and money to comply with the applicable requirements.
