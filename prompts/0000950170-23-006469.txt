Item 1.  BUSINESS
 All references in this report to “Corbus,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc., and its subsidiaries unless we state otherwise, or the context otherwise indicates.
 Overview
 Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (the “Company” or “Corbus”) is a precision oncology company committed to helping people defeat serious illness by bringing innovative scientific approaches to well understood biological pathways. Corbus’ internal development pipeline includes CRB-701, a next generation antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that targets the expression of Nectin-4 on cancer cells to release a cytotoxic payload and CRB-601, an anti-integrin monoclonal antibody that blocks the activation of TGFβ expressed on cancer cells. The Company has also developed CRB-913, an endocannabinoid small molecule drug, for the treatment of obesity and is seeking partners to fund further development.
 
Corbus’ precision oncology internal development pipeline:
 
•CRB-701 is a next generation ADC that targets the expression of Nectin-4 on cancer cells to release a cytotoxic payload. In February 2023, the Company obtained a license from CSPC Megalith Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd ("CSPC"), a subsidiary of CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited, to develop and commercialize the drug in the United States ("U.S."), Canada, the European Union (including the European Free Trade Area), the United Kingdom, and Australia (the “CSPC License Agreement”). The Investigational New Drug (IND) application for CRB-701 has been cleared by the U.S. FDA and the drug is currently being investigated by CSPC in a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors in China. Corbus is planning to bridge data from this Phase 1 trial to support a U.S. clinical trial starting in mid-2024.
 •CRB-601 is an anti-αvβ8 monoclonal antibody that blocks the activation of TGFβ expressed on cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment. In pre-clinical models, CRB-601 demonstrates enhanced anti-tumor activity when combined with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy compared to either single agent alone. Pre-clinical data suggests that blockade of latent TGFβ production by CRB-601 can lead to changes in immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, potentially enhancing the benefit of PD-1 blockade. CRB-601 is being developed as a potential treatment for patients with solid tumors in combination with existing therapies, including checkpoint inhibitors, and is scheduled for an IND submission in the second half of 2023. The Company expects to enroll the first patient in the Phase 1 study by the end of 2023.
 




Corbus’ endocannabinoid pipeline:
 •CRB-913 is a second-generation cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) inverse agonist designed to treat obesity and related metabolic diseases. In the diet-induced obesity mice model (DIO), CRB-913 demonstrates a reduction in weight and food consumption, improvement in insulin resistance and leptinemia, and reduced fat deposits in the liver. The CRB-913 program is in the pre-clinical stage, and we are seeking partnerships to fund further development.
 •Lenabasum is a novel, synthetic, oral molecule that selectively activates cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) for the treatment of inflammation and fibrosis. The drug completed Phase 3 studies in dermatomyositis and systemic sclerosis and these studies failed to meet their primary endpoints. In November 2022, the National Institutes of Health released results for the Phase 2 study it sponsored in systemic lupus erythematosus and lenabasum failed to demonstrate efficacy versus placebo. We do not plan to conduct additional clinical studies for lenabasum.
 CRB-701
 
CRB-701 is a novel clinical stage ADC that targets the expression of Nectin-4 on cancer cells to release a cytotoxic payload of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). In February 2023, the Company obtained a license from CSPC, a subsidiary of CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited, to develop and commercialize the drug in the United States, Canada, the European Union (including the European Free Trade Area), the United Kingdom, and Australia. The IND for CRB-701 has been cleared by the U.S. FDA and the drug is currently being investigated by CSPC in a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors in China. Corbus is planning to bridge data from the Phase 1 trial in China to support a U.S. clinical trial starting in mid-2024. During 2023, we plan on conducting pre-clinical translational studies and, in partnership with CSPC, plan to develop a companion diagnostic to identify tumors other than urothelial cancer that express lower levels of Nectin-4. The companion diagnostic is expected to help identify patients who are likely to respond to the therapy.
 
The targeting of Nectin-4 on cancer cells to release the cytotoxic payload MMAE is a clinically validated target as Enfortumab vedotin (PADCEV®) has been approved for the treatment of urothelial cancer (Figure 1). However, PADCEV® is also associated with serious adverse events and has a corresponding black box warning in its label. PADCEV® toxicity and safety limitations include serious and potentially life-threatening skin reactions and peripheral neuropathy, which negatively impact tolerability and dose intensity (Figure 2).
 

Figure 1: Nectin-4 is a clinically validated target with untapped potential
 






Figure 2: PADCEV® safety limitations
 



CRB-701 is designed to be an improved next generation site-specific Nectin-4 targeting ADC (Figure 3). The drug leverages site specific conjugation and novel linker technology to enable homogeneous payload incorporation. The linker technology attaches the MMAE cytotoxic payload to the monoclonal antibody and is designed to keep the MMAE attached to the monoclonal antibody until it binds to the Nectin-4 receptor on the target cell. MMAE is then released upon internalization within the target cell. The targeted delivery of CRB-701 is designed to maximize delivery of MMAE while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. CRB-701's longer half-life and low free plasma payload supports less frequent dosing. The complexity and cost of manufacturing for CRB-701 has also been reduced by the drug’s single enzyme and improved linker technology. CRB-701 may also offer immune-mediated tumor destruction functionality. The antibody for CRB-701 binds to the Fc receptor to trigger innate immune-mediated destruction as a secondary mechanism of action (Figure 4). Pre-clinical data suggest that CRB-701 has a comparative advantage versus standard of care for urothelial cancer and thus provides Corbus with the opportunity to develop an improved Nectin-4 targeting ADC with a differentiated profile (Figure 5).

CRB-601
 
We are developing CRB-601, an anti-αvβ8 integrin mAb for the treatment of solid tumors. The Company in-licensed the intellectual property for CRB-601 from Dr. Stephen Nishimura’s laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco.
 
TGFβ is a multifunctional cytokine involved in many cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation, immune response, wound healing, and tissue repair. In cancer, TGFβ mediates immune evasion (Figure 6) and plays a key role in promoting cancer cell growth and metastasis via its immunosuppressive effects in the tumor microenvironment. When overexpressed in the tumor milieu, TGFβ is linked to poor clinical outcomes (Figure 7). Similarly, the avb8 integrin appears to be the only TGFβ activating integrin expressed on regulatory T-cells, highlighting the key contribution of this integrin to immunosuppression. Tumor cells can also evade host immunity by activating TGFb via integrin avb8.
 
The αvβ8 integrin is a key regulator of TGFβ that is co-opted in many late-stage metastatic cancers to function as a pro-cancer cytokine. TGFβ is normally stored in the extracellular matrix as an inactive latent pro-protein complex. TGFβ is held in an inactive state in association with latency associate peptide (LAP) and is presented on cell surfaces by latent transforming growth factor β binding proteins (e.g., LTBP1, GARP); these three components comprising the large latent complex (LLC). Upon binding of the LAP-TGFβ complex to the αvβ8 integrin TGFb is released and can now activate the TGFb receptor and the associated SMAD signaling pathway that leads to a related transcription translation program of TGFb target genes. CRB-601 was specifically designed to bind at the TGFβ activation site on αvβ8 (Figure 8), thereby blocking αvβ8-dependent activation.

Figure 7: TGFβ predicts poor clinical outcomes in a subset of cancer patients
 



Figure 8: Targeting the integrin αvβ8 represents a novel approach to regulating TGFβ
 


While checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have led to dramatic improvements in survival rates for certain cancer patients, there is still a significant subset of patients who do not respond to this class of medicine. In resistant murine tumor models, CRB-601 has demonstrated that it enhanced the effect of anti-PD-1 checkpoint therapy (Figure 9).

Endocannabinoid Pipeline
 
CRB-913
 
Corbus has developed CRB-913, a second-generation cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) inverse agonist designed to treat obesity and related metabolic diseases. In the diet-induced obesity mice model (DIO), CRB-913 demonstrates a reduction in weight, food consumption, and fat deposits in the liver and improvement in insulin resistance and leptinemia. CRB-913 induces weight loss both as a monotherapy (Figure 10) and in combination with the incretin analogs liraglutide (SaxendaTM), semaglutide (WegovyTM) and tirzepatide (MounjaroTM) (Figure 11). The CRB-913 program is in the pre-clinical stage, and we are seeking partnerships to fund further development.

Lenabasum
 
Lenabasum is a novel, synthetic, oral molecule that selectively activates cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) for the treatment of inflammation and fibrosis. The drug completed Phase 3 studies in dermatomyositis and systemic sclerosis and these studies failed to meet their primary endpoints. In November 2022, the National Institutes of Health released results for the Phase 2 study it sponsored in systemic lupus erythematosus and lenabasum failed to demonstrate efficacy versus placebo. We do not plan to conduct additional clinical studies for lenabasum.
Our Business Development Strategy
 
Our goal is to develop novel therapeutics in oncology for well understood biological pathways by utilizing precision medicine to identify the genetic drivers and biomarkers for each specific type of cancer and then develop companion diagnostics that will better identify patient populations that will be most likely to benefit from our therapies. Our key business goals are as follows:
•Develop a companion diagnostic and perform translational validation studies for CRB-701 in 2023 followed by the first U.S. clinical study in mid-2024.
 •File an IND for CRB-601 in the third quarter 2023 and initiate a Phase 1 trial for CRB-601 by the end of 2023.
 •Expand and diversify our precision oncology pipeline through a licensing and acquisition strategy.
 •Enter into partnerships for our endocannabinoid drug CRB-913 to fund further development.
 
Research and Development
 
We incurred expenses of approximately $16,137,000 and $36,445,000 for research and development activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These expenses include cash and non-cash expenses relating to the development of our clinical and pre-clinical programs for our pipeline. Research and development expenses are incurred for the development of our drug candidates and consist primarily of payroll and payments to contract research and development companies. To date, these costs are related to generating pre-clinical data and the cost of manufacturing drug product for clinical trials and conducting clinical trials.

Other Intellectual Property Matters
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technologies and to operate without infringing the proprietary right of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We strive to protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents and trademarks as well as through the confidentiality provisions in our contracts. With respect to our candidates, we endeavor to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and internationally on all patentable aspects of each product candidate. We cannot be sure that the patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents issued or licensed to us in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property Rights.”
 In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, aspects of our proprietary technology platform are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how related to the manufacturing of our product candidates. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 We also seek and will continue to seek trademark protection in the United States and outside of the United States where available and when appropriate. We use and intend to use these registered marks in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development as well as our product candidates.
 Manufacturing and Supply of CRB-701, CRB-601, and CRB-913
 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations or licensing partners to supply Corbus with drugs for pre-clinical and clinical studies.

CRB-701 is designed to be an improved next generation site-specific Nectin-4 targeting antibody drug conjugate. CRB-701 is a monoclonal antibody attached to an MMAE cytotoxic payload using a proprietary linker technology. CSPC has developed a manufacturing process under current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) to produce batches of drug substance and drug product for pre-clinical and clinical studies. CSPC will supply drug substance and drug product in support of clinical and commercial activities.

CRB-601 is a monoclonal antibody and we are in the process of developing a manufacturing process under cGMP to produce batches of drug substance and drug product for pre-clinical and clinical studies. Drug substance for CRB-601 will be produced by a contract manufacturer through recombinant DNA technology utilizing genetically engineered host cells, upstream cell culture processes and downstream purification methods as required to manufacture the drug substance.

CRB-913 is a second-generation cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) inverse agonist and we have developed a manufacturing process under cGMP to produce batches of drug substance for pre-clinical and IND-enabling studies. Drug substance for CRB-913 has been produced by a contract manufacturer to initiate drug product studies.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by a rapid pace of new innovation and discoveries, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. We face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others.
 
Competitors to CRB-701 who are targeting Nectin-4 include Seagen, Bicycle Therapeutics, and Mabwell. Competitors to CRB-601 who are also targeting the TGFβ pathway in cancer include Bristol Meyers, Merck KGaA, Pfizer, Sanofi, Argenx, Morphic, Pliant and Scholar Rock. Competitors to CRB-913 who are also targeting obesity include Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Amgen, and Pfizer.


Regulatory Matters
 Government Regulation
 The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Any product development activities related to products that we may develop or acquire in the future will be subject to extensive regulation by various government authorities, including the FDA, other federal, state and local agencies and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, which regulate the design, research, clinical and pre-clinical development, testing, manufacturing, storage, distribution, import, export, labeling, advertising and marketing of pharmaceutical products and devices. Generally, before a new drug can be sold, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. The data are often generated in two distinct development states: pre-clinical and clinical.
 Development of Drugs in the United States
 Products that we may develop or acquire in the future must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. For new chemical entities, the pre-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, and drug stability as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies that support subsequent clinical testing. These pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests are often performed under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices regulations. A drug’s sponsor must submit the result of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol to the FDA as part of an IND application, which is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug or biological product to humans. Similar filings are required in other countries.
 The clinical stage of development can generally be divided into three sequential phases that may overlap: Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials. In Phase 1, generally, small numbers of healthy volunteers are initially exposed to single escalating doses and then multiple escalating doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these studies is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action and general safety of the drug. Phase 2 trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits, common short-term side effects and risks. Phase 2 studies are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. Phase 3 trials are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include from several hundred to several thousand subjects and are closely controlled and monitored. In addition to these Phase 1-3 trials, other trials may be conducted to gather additional safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information. Pharmaceutical products with active ingredients equal or similar to those already approved by the FDA often have more streamlined development programs than compounds entirely new to the agency, often skipping Phase 1 and 2 trials.
 A clinical plan must be submitted to the FDA prior to commencement of a clinical trial. If the FDA has concerns about the clinical plan or the safety of the proposed studies, they may suspend or terminate the study at any time. Studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice and reporting of study progress and any adverse experiences is required. Studies are also subject to review by independent institutional review boards responsible for overseeing studies at particular sites and protecting human research study subjects. An independent institutional review board may also suspend or terminate a study once initiated. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
 Post-approval studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. Sometimes, these studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic condition. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 studies. In other situations, post-approval studies aim to gain additional indications for a medication or develop new dosage forms for a medication.


Special Protocol Assessment
 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act directs the FDA to meet with sponsors, pursuant to a sponsor’s written request, for the purpose of reaching agreement on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in a New Drug Application (NDA) or a Biologic Licensing Application (BLA). If an agreement is reached, the FDA will reduce the agreement to writing and make it part of the administrative record. This agreement is called a special protocol assessment (SPA). While the FDA’s guidance on SPAs states that documented SPAs should be considered binding on the review division, the FDA has latitude to change its assessment if certain exceptions apply. Exceptions include public health concerns emerging that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, identification of a substantial scientific issue essential to the safety or efficacy testing that later comes to light, a sponsor’s failure to follow the protocol agreed upon, or the FDA’s reliance on data, assumptions or information that are determined to be wrong.
 
Review and Approval in the United States
 Following pivotal or Phase 3 trial completion, data are analyzed to determine safety and efficacy. Data are then filed with the FDA in an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing and testing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality. In the United States, FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before marketing a pharmaceutical product. The NDA or BLA must contain proof of safety, purity, potency, and efficacy, which entails extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing.
 The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of applications by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take several years to complete. The FDA may conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with current good manufacturing practice requirements and may also audit data from clinical and pre-clinical trials.
 There is no assurance that the FDA will act favorably or quickly in making such reviews and significant difficulties or costs may be encountered in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals. The FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or may condition the approval of the NDA or BLA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Further, the FDA may place conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of regulatory review and approval process. In addition to the potential period of exclusivity, orphan designation makes a company eligible for grant funding of up to $400,000 per year for four years to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption from the FDA application user fee.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i) the drug’s orphan designation is revoked; (ii) its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii) the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant’s product; (iv) the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v) a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. We have received orphan drug designation for lenabasum for cystic fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, and dermatomyositis. There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for our products.


Drug Development in Europe
 In the European Union, our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Similar to the U.S., the marketing of medicinal products is subject to the granting of marketing authorizations by regulatory agencies. Also, as in the U.S., the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 Review and Approval in the European Union
 In the European Union, approval of new medicinal products can be obtained through one of three processes: the mutual recognition procedure, the centralized procedure, and the decentralized procedure. We intend to determine which process we will follow, if any, in the future.
 Mutual Recognition Procedure: An applicant submits an application in one European Union member state, known as the reference member state. Once the reference member state has granted the marketing authorization, the applicant may choose to submit applications in other concerned member states, requesting them to mutually recognize the marketing authorizations already granted. Under this mutual recognition process, authorities in other concerned member states have 55 days to raise objections, which must then be resolved by discussion among the concerned member states, the reference member state and the applicant within 90 days of the commencement of the mutual recognition procedure. If any disagreement remains, all considerations by authorities in the concerned member states are suspended and the disagreement is resolved through an arbitration process. The mutual recognition procedure results in separate national marketing authorizations in the reference member state.
 Centralized Procedure: This procedure is currently mandatory for products developed by means of a biotechnological process and optional for new active substances and other “innovative medicinal products with novel characteristics.” Under this procedure, an application is submitted to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products. Two European Union member states are appointed to conduct an initial evaluation of each application. These countries each prepare an assessment report that is then used as the basis of a scientific opinion of the Committee on Proprietary Medical Products. If this opinion is favorable, it is sent to the European Commission, which drafts a decision. After consulting with the member states, the European Commission adopts a decision and grants a marketing authorization, which is valid throughout the European Union and confers the same rights and obligations in each of the member states as a marketing authorization granted by that member state.
 Decentralized Procedure: The most recently introduced of the three processes for obtaining approval of new medicinal processes in the European Union, the decentralized procedure is similar to the mutual recognition procedure described above, but with differences in the timing that key documents are provided to concerned member states by the reference member state, the overall timing of the procedure and the possibility of, among other things, “clock stops” during the procedure.
 Post-Marketing Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory authorities, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the products or labeling or changes of site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. The FDA regulations require the products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, and NDA and BLA holders must list their products and register their manufacturing establishments with the FDA. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with current good manufacturing practice and other laws. NDA and BLA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms. These firms are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them.
 

Other Regulatory Matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. These regulations include:
 •the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
 •federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law or related to off-label promotion constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal false claims laws;
 •the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
 •the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 •applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act.
 •The Lanham Act and federal antitrust laws.
 •state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, traceability, and storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products
 The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. In the U.S., our product candidate, lenabasum, is currently classified as Schedule I controlled substance as defined in the Controlled Substance Act (the “CSA”).
 Schedule I controlled substances are pharmaceutical products subject to specific regulations under the CSA, that establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. All parties responsible for the manufacturing, distribution and testing the drug in clinical studies must apply for and obtain a license from the DEA before they are permitted to perform these activities with lenabasum. Furthermore, these parties must have the security, control, recordkeeping, reporting and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. All licensed facilities are required to renew their registrations annually if they intend to continue to work with our drug. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments that handle controlled substances. We have been working with our manufacturers, distributors, exporters and clinical sites to obtain the necessary licenses to work with lenabasum. The parties responsible for the manufacturing, distribution and export of lenabasum have already applied for and have been granted DEA licenses and a number of institutions responsible for conducting our current clinical studies have also been granted DEA licenses.


Individual states have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs, as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug based on federal action, other states schedule drugs through rulemaking or a legislative action. The requirement for state registrations could also result in delay of the manufacturing, distribution of lenabasum or in the completion of our current clinical studies. We and our manufacturing vendors and clinical sites must also obtain separate state registrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.
 Third-Party Payer Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any of our drug candidates that ultimately may obtain regulatory approval. In both the United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our product candidates, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including, in the United States, governmental payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by the CMS, through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program. Each payer has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product. Private payers often rely on the lead of the governmental payers in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable CMS coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product. The competitive position of some of our products will depend, in part, upon the extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products and for the procedures in which such products are used. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers.
 The United States Congress and state legislatures may, from time to time, propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. For example, the two-year spending law signed by the President of United States on February 9, 2018 includes a provision raising the manufacturer discount to 70% in 2019 in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the “donut hole.” Under prior law, manufacturers were required to provide a 50% discount on prescription drugs purchased in the donut hole. Manufacturers of branded drugs will face much higher liabilities from donut hole payments beginning in 2019, estimated at multiple billions of dollars for some of the largest companies.
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payer interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms.
 Some third-party payers also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably.
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
