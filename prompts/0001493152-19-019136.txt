Description of Business
 
App Incubator Segment
 
In August of 2016 Globe Net began to develop its business concept to capitalize on the proliferation of open source application programming interface (API) ecosystems. Management ascertained one of the key success metrics today is service velocity or the speed with which services can be developed and introduced to the market to generate revenue.
 
Currently, Globe Net has developed its TextPro app and is currently developing its second app. Swappit, for its app incubator business segment. TextPro Connect IQ is a single, unified, web-based system allowing customers to create campaigns that utilize a variety of marketing tools. Swappit it is a person to person online swapping platform.
 
Digital services in the API economy are increasingly being developed using a new design pattern known as microservices. Wikipedia defines microservices as: “a software architecture style in which complex applications are composed of small, independent processes communicating with each other using language-agnostic APIs.
 
In order to take advantage of the API ecosystem economy, Globe Net wants to become an agile business, able to participate in on-demand, context driven API economy value chains and to bring new services to market faster. The network as a digital platform will enable them to design and deploy customer-facing digital services by “mashing up” network and IT service components that run in the platform with each other, and potentially with services exposed by third-party platforms.
 
Rural Internet Service Provider (RISP) Segment
 
During the fiscal period ending August 31, 2019 Globe Net was still working on the development of its business segment to provide rural communities with high-speed internet connectivity at speeds equal or better than existing competing services. Through the use of its Internet and wireless connectivity systems, Globe Net’s goal is to develop and provide internet and related services to both consumers and businesses in currently under serviced or unserviceable areas at real broadband speeds. Globe Net planned to offer for sale its GNW Systems to residents and businesses located in under-serviced or non-serviced rural areas worldwide with the initial focus on North America and China. Although Globe Net continues to attempt to achieve its goal of becoming a rural internet provider, management’s current plan is to focus on Globe Net’s app business.

Products
 
TextPro Connect IQ
 
TextPro Connect IQ is a single, unified, web-based system allowing customers to create campaigns that utilize a variety of marketing tools, including mobile coupons, SMS marketing, QR codes, mobile keywords, Mobile splash pages, surveys, voting, polls, email marketing and social media status updates. Additionally, business and event planners have the ability to offer text reminders. Small businesses that rely on scheduled meetings with customers can do away with fears of missed appointments, reservations, or scheduled maintenance and repairs.
 
Globe Net utilizes a software as a service (SAAS) model for TextPro Connect IQ. SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense of hardware acquisition, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support. Customers are charged a monthly fee for access to our platform and purchase voice and text credits from us using a PayPal gateway.
 
Swappit
 
Swappit it is a person to person online swapping platform. Users download the app, and then set their criteria which will allow Swappit to find a potential swapping match. The criteria will be based on how long you are willing to trade for in days or weeks, the distance you are willing to travel to trade in kilometers or miles, you item category and price level, then a picture of the items. Once all the parameters have been entered by the user, then the Swappit app will then search through it database of users to find a potential swapping match and allow the user to decide if they want to proceed with a swap or wait and search for more items. Once a match is what the user desires they simply arrange to meet the other user and complete the swap.
RISP
 
Globe Net is still developing a system to deliver high-speed Internet service wirelessly to rural subscribers. It is Globe Net’s goal is to offer quality, high-speed wireless Internet service to end-users who are without Internet service or underserviced as a result of inferior technologies. Globe Net intends to develop a new technology that will broadcast an omni-directional wireless signal with a radius of up to approximately 20 miles using 700MHz spectrum. Unlike microwave, WiFi, or WiMax, direct line of sight is not necessary, which increases its practicality while reducing broadcasting costs. Globe Net’s Internet and wireless connectivity systems will transmit high-speed Internet service wirelessly over the 600MHz - 800MHz spectrum, 700MHz being the optimal band, at speeds as high as 20Mbps (megabits per second) download and 4Mbps upload. The signal will be transmitted from an omni-directional antenna mounted on an elevated structure, such as a transmission or communications tower. Because the signal is transmitted at a relatively low frequency, it is not as susceptible to obstructions as Wi-Fi or satellite services, as the signal can penetrate through most vegetation and other solid obstacles such as buildings.

Competitive Conditions
 
The app market is highly competitive and the percentage of companies that survive and prosper is small. App development companies often experience unexpected problems in the areas of product development, manufacturing, marketing, financing, and general management, among others, which frequently cannot be solved. In addition, companies may require substantial amounts of financing, which may not be available through institutional private placements, the public markets or otherwise.
 
Globe Net’s app incubator business is extremely competitive and always changing. Within the app marketplace, there are an enormous number of corporations that are competing for online users, advertising dollars, sponsorship fees and many other unique opportunities for revenue. Many of these potential competitors are likely to enjoy substantial competitive advantages, including:
 

1. | greater financial, technical and marketing resources that can be devoted to the development, promotion and sale of their services; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | easier and more access to capital; 
3. | longer operating histories; 
4. | greater name recognition and established corporate identity; 
5. | larger user base; and 
6. | developed apps and websites. 

Raw Materials / Equipment
 
The raw materials for the Globe Net app incubator business will include computers; GPS enabled Smartphone’s, open source software and labor to write software code.

Globe Net will need the omni-directional antennae, servers, amplifiers and transmitters for transmitting its RISP signal as well as Yagi-Uda directional antennae, routers and a receiver to receive its RISP signal.
 
Principal Suppliers
 
Globe Net is not dependent on any single supplier for the app incubator business. However, Globe Net will depend on outside programmers and consultants to provide innovative solutions and programming expertise.
 
Globe Net currently has no principal suppliers for equipment or services for its RISP business. Globe Net needs to establish a supply chain for the required equipment and the raw materials for its RISP Business. Also, Globe Net will need to identify service providers within the rural installation communities to provide the required services to the subscribers.
 
Dependence on Customers
 
Currently, Globe Net is not and will not be dependent on one or a few major customers.
 
Trademark and Licenses
 
Globe Net currently has no patents or trademarks; and Globe Net is not party to any license, franchise, concession, or royalty agreements or any labor contracts.

However, there can be no assurance that existing or new laws or regulations that may be adopted in various jurisdictions in the future will not impose additional fees and taxes on Globe Net and its business operations. Management is not aware of any such revisions to existing laws and regulations nor new laws or regulations that could have a negative impact on Globe Net’s business and add additional costs to Globe Net’s business operations.
Research and Development Costs
 
Globe Net has not spent any funds on either company-sponsored research and development activities or customer-sponsored research activities relating to the development of new products, services or techniques or the improvement of existing products, services, or techniques.
