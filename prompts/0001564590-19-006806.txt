Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 
We are a commercial stage life sciences company focused on advancing the promise of precision medicine. Our product and service solutions are based on our proprietary next generation digital HTG EdgeSeq technology that enables the detection and measurement of biomarkers using a small amount of biological sample, in liquid or solid forms. Our menu of HTG EdgeSeq assays are automated on our HTG EdgeSeq platform, which applies genetic sequencing tools that generate expression data in a timely manner utilizing a simplified workflow for customers. We seek to leverage key business drivers in molecular profiling for biomarker analysis and diagnostics, including the acceleration of precision medicine, the migration of molecular testing to NGS-based applications, the movement to smaller and less invasive biopsies, the need for greater diagnostic sensitivity, the need to conform to challenging healthcare economics and the need for automation and an easily deployable workflow. For example, these capabilities enable customers to extend the use of limited biological samples for retrospective analysis, gaining further understanding of the molecular drivers of disease with the goal of developing biomarker-driven targeted therapies. We also believe our technology can be used in clinical applications that will simplify, consolidate and reduce the cost of NGS-based diagnostic workflows and in commercialized companion diagnostic (“CDx”) tests. 
 
In 2014, we launched our HTG EdgeSeq technology, which generates a molecular profiling library for detection of RNA using NGS. Our HTG EdgeSeq assays are automated on our HTG EdgeSeq platform. Our innovative platform and menu of molecular profiling panels are being utilized in two complimentary ways in advancing precision health. Biopharmaceutical companies and other translational research centers utilize our technology to discover and validate biomarkers which can identify patient populations most likely to respond to certain therapies. The capability to analyze hundreds or thousands of genes from a small biological sample allows customers to more economically unlock substantial amounts of molecular data. In addition to purchasing our technology for use in customer facilities, customers can also obtain the advantages of our proprietary technology through our service offerings. Pre-clinical services, including custom assay development and sample processing services provided by our VERI/O laboratory, allow customers the ability to more efficiently identify and validate biomarker signatures across their drug portfolios. Our ISO 13485 2018 quality system and diagnostic development teams also partner with biopharmaceutical company customers to develop, manufacture and commercialize companion diagnostics. Although our initial focus is oncology, we offer customers a full solution from biomarker discovery to deployment of CDx tests across all disease states. Clinical testing labs face significant challenges in adopting NGS-based workflows and the HTG EdgeSeq platform was designed to address many of these challenges such as high sample loads, RNA extraction and other costly and complex workflow processes. Utilizing NGS as our method of detection provides our customers with the benefits of our highly multiplexed and extraction-free chemistry and the sensitivity and dynamic range of the sequencers, providing a powerful value proposition and complete workflow. 
 
Our HTG EdgeSeq platform is currently focused on RNA-based applications, which we believe is an area of significant unmet need and where we have demonstrated competitive advantages. In addition to expanding our applications in RNA, we are developing our HTG EdgeSeq technology to analyze DNA in biological samples, as we expect the market to express a growing need for multi-modal testing and analysis.
 
Our products include instrumentation (or platforms), consumables, including assay kits, and software analytics that, as an integrated system, automate sample workflow and can quickly, robustly and simultaneously profile tens, hundreds or thousands of molecular targets from samples a fraction of the size required by many prevailing technologies. Our objective is to establish our solutions as the standard in biomarker development and molecular diagnostics, and to make their benefits accessible to all molecular labs from research to the clinic. We believe that our target customers desire high quality molecular profiling information in a multiplexed panel format from increasingly smaller and less invasive samples, with the ability to test and analyze such information locally to minimize turnaround time and cost.
 
We believe customer utilization of our HTG EdgeSeq technology will drive the following three distinct but synergistic revenue streams:
 
 
1. | Research use only (“RUO”) profiling revenue associated with biomarker programs in biopharmaceutical companies and other translational research centers. Customers access our technology by purchasing our HTG EdgeSeq platform and/or utilizing our VERI/O service lab capabilities. The number of early stage biomarker programs utilizing our technology has been growing steadily and we expect this number to continue to grow as we launch new profiling panels. We expect some of these programs to advance to late-stage programs that will require diagnostic grade investigational use only (“IUO”) assays for use in clinical trials, which is a driver of our second revenue stream, collaboration service revenue.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Collaborative development services revenue associated with companion diagnostic development programs for biopharmaceutical companies. Our HTG EdgeSeq technology is utilized to develop, seek regulatory approval for and commercialize CDx assays for biopharmaceutical drug candidates and corresponding therapeutics. In November 2016, we entered into a Master Assay Development, Commercialization and Manufacturing Agreement (the “Governing Agreement”) with QIAGEN Manchester Limited (“QML”), a wholly owned subsidiary of QIAGEN N.V. in the field of oncology. We have also entered into collaborative development agreements directly with biopharmaceutical company customers in other fields. Alone, or in partnership with QML, we have entered into four companion diagnostic agreements

to date, of which two are actively generating collaborative development services revenue as of December 31, 2018. Collaborative development services revenue has been and is expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period as this revenue is heavily milestone-driven such that delays in completion or acceptance of project milestones and biopharmaceutical company customer internal timeline adjustments result in periods of varying levels of development activity that is often difficult to forecast. We believe this is an important component of our business due to the possibility of successful late stage programs leading to commercialization of CDx tests in multiple geographies. We believe such commercialization would contribute significantly to our third expected revenue stream.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Our third developing revenue stream, MDx revenue, which represents the sale of our regulated diagnostic products, is expected to begin initial ramp in 2019. We plan to generate MDx revenue from three primary sources:
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companion diagnostic assays resulting from our biopharmaceutical collaborations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | diagnostic partnerships resulting from our collaborations with European key opinion leaders; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proprietary diagnostic assays developed by us.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
As of December 31, 2018, we sell two internally developed proprietary CE/IVD marked assays, including our HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay EU and HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay EU. Several additional diagnostic tests are in early stage development, which we expect to drive this category of revenue in future periods. 
 
To facilitate further our ability to generate European MDx revenue and improve our responsiveness to customer needs on a local level, we formed of a French subsidiary, HTG Molecular Diagnostics France SARL (“HTG France”), in November 2018. We plan to have HTG France operate an applications incubator laboratory in Sausheim, France, providing application support and biomarker program services for our European collaborations. We expect HTG France to provide similar biomarker program services to those provided by our VERI/O laboratory in the United States, on a much smaller scale, in the second half of 2019. 
 
In the first quarter of 2019, we announced the initiation of a program for the clinical development of a comprehensive breast cancer molecular diagnostic assay. This program will be headquartered in a new development facility in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. Our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Maureen Cronin, will oversee this new breast cancer program and Dr. Joseph Sparano of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine has agreed to lead our scientific advisory board for the program. Dr. Cronin and Dr. Sparano have extensive experience in breast cancer and breast cancer diagnostics which we expect to provide significant benefit throughout this development process. In addition, Laura Beggrow, our President, Diagnostics, will lead our diagnostic initiatives, including the daily management of the breast cancer program’s development team and collaboration with our key opinion leaders.  
 Our Strategy
 Our objective is to establish our solutions as the standard in molecular profiling, and to make their benefits accessible to all molecular labs from research to the clinic. The key components of our strategy are:

• | Increase and strengthen companion diagnostics collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies. We believe collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies with late-stage drug development programs will lead to us generating companion diagnostic consumables revenue. As of December 31, 2018, we had 75 active early stage development programs across leading biopharmaceutical companies which are incorporating biomarkers and potentially companion diagnostics in their drug development programs. We plan to develop novel RNA-based gene classifiers to help biopharmaceutical companies and leading translational medicine researchers better understand and predict durable response to immune checkpoint inhibitor drug candidates, such as anti-PD-L1 therapeutics, in mono and combination therapies. We also plan to develop novel RNA and DNA profiling tests that can provide important biomarker information in emerging areas of immuno-oncology, auto-immune and other disease areas.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop new proprietary molecular diagnostic panels with high medical utility. Our HTG EdgeSeq platform was developed with features that we believe solve many of the issues facing NGS-based workflows. Our technology will enable local molecular labs to routinely test targeted RNA expression, including expressed gene mutations, such as ALK gene rearrangements using our HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay, all from extremely small samples, such as a single five-micron section of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (“FFPE”) tissue. We plan to develop future molecular diagnostic assays in conformance with existing reimbursement codes to facilitate our clinical customers’ billings. We also plan to work in the major European medical centers to develop and validate certain solid tumor classifiers and lower cost alternatives for breast and prostate cancer testing.

• | Establish our systems workflow as the best solution for clinical sequencing. We intend to continue to establish our technology as the best complimentary workflow with next generation sequencers. We believe our differentiated HTG EdgeSeq chemistry will accelerate adoption by leveraging the large and growing installed base of next generation sequencers. We are engaged with industry and corporate partners, including Illumina, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. and QML, to position our HTG EdgeSeq products as the benchmark for workflow in targeted sequencing applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the addressable market of our technology through new applications and expansion into new liquid biopsies. We have demonstrated technical feasibility for several new applications that are intended to allow us to measure DNA mutations directly and/or in expressed RNA and improve the already-high sensitivity of our HTG EdgeSeq assays. These and other planned new applications are expected to allow us to, among other things, develop future “multi-parameter” panels that detect both RNA and DNA targets in a single assay, for use in translational research, companion diagnostics and molecular diagnostics. As biopsies continue to utilize less invasive methods, it will be important to expand our applicability to new liquid samples such as PAXgene, platelets and exosomes.

Our Market Opportunities
 Cancer Molecular Profiling and Genomics in Life Science Research
 Molecular profiling is the analysis of biomarkers, including DNA and RNA and protein, in biological samples, such as tissue, cells, blood and other biofluids, to identify gene expression patterns or genomic changes. The HTG EdgeSeq technology coupled with NGS is making it possible to perform these characterizations in unprecedented ways, resulting in a shift from the traditional approach of looking at one target at a time to the simultaneous analysis of potentially tens, hundreds or thousands of targets. 
 Among what we believe are the most promising applications of molecular profiling is the targeted sequencing of RNA and DNA from patient samples to identify gene expression patterns or molecular markers of disease that can aid in diagnosis, gauge patient prognosis or predict response to an available therapy. These applications have launched a fundamental shift towards personalized medicine where an individual patient’s molecular profile is used to guide treatment. 
 The market for molecular profiling in cancer is expected to be $8.9 billion by 2022. The genomics market, to which our technology is broadly applicable, is expected to reach over $22.0 billion in the same timeframe.  
 Therapy Driven Diagnostics - Companion Diagnostics
 The World Health Organization estimates that cancer will lead to the death of 11.5 million people by 2030. While progress has been made, it is commonly accepted that cancer therapies are not helping enough patients. As a result, biopharmaceutical companies are aggressively deploying biomarker driven strategies to improve the response rates to existing and new drugs in development. These companies are looking for technology solutions that can more effectively identify the biological root causes of disease and aid the discovery on biomarkers to better develop and target drugs to the right patients. The companion diagnostic market is currently estimated at $2.6 billion and growing approximately 20% annually. We believe that the acceleration of investment into immunotherapy drugs will also be a catalyst for future companion diagnostics for combination therapies where RNA gene expression classification is expected to be important.
 When a molecular biomarker panel is used for selection of patients in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety and efficacy of a new drug, the drug and biomarker test are often submitted to the applicable regulatory agency for approval together. In the United States, upon U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval or clearance of the CDx test, the patient must be tested with the CDx test prior to being treated with the drug. Companion diagnostic tests have a clear clinical utility which generally supports favorable reimbursement decisions. We believe there are over 900 active oncology drug development programs, most of which have molecular biomarker strategies, creating a significant opportunity for molecular diagnostic companies with the right molecular profiling solutions. 
 Molecular Diagnostics – NGS-based Workflows
 Complexities and Challenges of Molecular Diagnostics Today
 Currently, molecular profiling typically is conducted in the clinical setting using a variety of profiling techniques and instrumentation platforms across multiple laboratory departments, and, in many situations, sent to distant labs. These techniques include immunohistochemistry (“IHC”), fluorescent in situ hybridization (“FISH”), polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”), gene expression arrays (“GEA”) and NGS. This distributed profiling approach has accelerated the use of molecular profiling and increased the need to make the process more accessible and routine. However, molecular profiling is also highly specialized because many current technologies are complex, require multiple capital-intensive workflows, and are not economically scalable to the case volume of the local laboratory. The fragmentation of methods, smaller sample sizes, sample logistics and information flow has created significant challenges for labs, physicians and patients.

Our Solution
 At the core of our solution is our proprietary chemistry known as quantitative nuclease protection (“qNPA”). Our qNPA-based chemistries provide a sensitive and efficient method for analyzing DNA and RNA as it eliminates the need for DNA or RNA extraction and other complex processes. We designed and developed our automation platforms to optimize the capabilities of our chemistries, provide fast turnaround time and enable ease of use to molecular labs. Our chemistries and automation platforms are highly adaptable, so when molecular profiling needs change or emerge, we expect to be able to efficiently add new applications to address these needs.
 Our products and services are designed to work with many different biological sample types, can generate robust results from very small samples, and obviate the need for many of the sample-preparation steps associated with traditional molecular techniques. Our platforms and assays enable the simultaneous detection and quantitation of tens, hundreds or thousands of molecular targets and are capable, now or in the future, of profiling multiple parameters such as RNA expression levels, RNA-expressed gene fusions and insertions and DNA mutations in a single testing workflow that can use NGS detection for quantitative measurement.
 We believe most customers in our target markets would prefer to maintain control of their samples and perform the testing and analysis internally but are challenged by limitations in available technologies. We believe we are well positioned to democratize NGS‑based molecular profiling with the following key product benefits:
  
• | Optimize sample utilization. Our systems can analyze as many as 2,500 genes from extremely small sample volumes such as a single five-micron section of tissue or 15 microliters of plasma or serum. Our technology allows customers to do more with less, which meets the needs of clinical or pre-clinical laboratories where today there is often not enough patient sample to do all the testing desired. We believe providing customers the ability to work with extremely small sample will be a significant driver of adoption of our technology and systems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compatibility with multiple sample types. Our HTG systems allow customers to profile and unlock molecular information from a wide variety of biological samples such as FFPE tissue, cells, blood serum and plasma. We have successfully demonstrated the ability to profile these and other sample types and believe we ultimately can profile most clinically relevant sample types, including cell-free circulating nucleic acids from tumors, a rapidly developing area of investigation which is referred to as a liquid biopsy. We believe that the capabilities of our system will allow us to efficiently expand applications, regardless of sample type.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible and adaptable chemistry allows for use in multiple applications. We believe our proprietary chemistry provides the ability to measure a variety of molecular targets in many necessary applications, including RNA expression levels, expressed RNA gene rearrangements (such as gene fusions and insertions), and DNA point mutations, and offers the ability to quantify these applications on a variety of NGS platforms. This flexibility provides customers the ability to optimize their use of our technologies based on their specific throughput, workflow and application needs. Our proprietary chemistry is comparatively simple, with fewer steps than competing technologies. For example, compared to RT-quantitative PCR (“qRT-PCR”), our chemistry does not require cDNA synthesis. Compared to traditional RNA sequencing, our chemistry does not require extraction, cDNA synthesis, shearing, rRNA depletion, ligation, adenylation, or size selection. We believe that the elimination of these steps helps prevent biases associated with these steps, sample degradation and increased opportunities for technician error.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Robust data. Molecular profiling produces large amounts of information that is used, among other things, to make important decisions, such as identifying potential drug targets or selecting a patient for a therapeutic treatment. This information is valuable only to the extent it accurately represents the true biology of the test sample and the same answer can be produced under many different conditions. Our chemistries are highly specific and sensitive, meaning they can detect the right target even when very little is present in the sample. Our system produces consistent results on a replicate-to-replicate, day-to-day and instrument-to-instrument basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Automation provides superior workflow and ease of use. Our technologies are designed with fewer workflow steps in part due to the elimination of the need for complex sample-preparation processes such as extraction, cDNA synthesis, labeling, selection, depletion and shearing. This enables customers to limit hands-on time and the need for specialized skills, resulting in turnaround times of approximately 36 hours. Additionally, our HTG EdgeSeq system further integrates sample preparation for targeted sequencing and greatly simplifies the data bioinformatics, so customers looking to leverage their NGS instrument can seamlessly add this capability to their current workflows.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simplified bioinformatics. Our software provides data in a simple and easy to use format through a simple graphical user interface that is flexible enough for researchers yet structured enough for clinical laboratories. The HTG EdgeSeq parser software, which processes the data from the NGS platform, is modular so that new applications can be downloaded without any changes to hardware. We believe the simplicity of our bioinformatics solution will help drive the adoption of our platform.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Current Commercial Panels Offered on the HTG EdgeSeq Platform
 We currently market proprietary molecular profiling panels targeting late stage drug development programs with potential breakthrough therapies, such as immuno-oncology. We market these panels to biopharmaceutical companies, with which we collaborate in biomarker development programs. We believe these programs could facilitate our commercialization of companion diagnostic tests. In addition, our panels are used in pre-clinical and clinical research areas, which, we also believe, will facilitate our commercialization of diagnostic tests, including tumor classifiers and prognostic tests. Our currently marketed panels are:
  
• | HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel. This RNA expression panel measures the expression of up to 2,560 genes implicated in cancer for profiling tumor tissues, analyzing cancer pathways and identifying new biomarkers across both solid tumors and hematolymphoid neoplasms. We worked with key opinion leaders to identify the genes in this panel, which we believe is a comprehensive list of genes targeting known signaling pathways and receptor gene families implicated in cancer. Representative genes in this panel include EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4, PD-1 and FGFR. When paired with our HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole-Transcriptome Assay (below), we provide customers with a comprehensive solution for profiling their large sample archives for novel expression signatures.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay. One of the most promising areas of cancer therapy is immunotherapy or immuno-oncology, where new classes of oncology drugs are thought to enable or boost the host immune response towards tumors. Multiple drugs targeting the genes CTLA4, PD-1 and PD-L1 are on market with additional candidates moving into late-stage trials. Profiling samples for the genes targeted by these therapies may be predictive of drug response and aid in the stratification of patients into responsive and non-responsive groups. The HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay measures the expression of 549 of these immuno-oncology-associated genes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay. DLBCL tumors are frequently classified into either the activated B-cell like (“ABC”) or germinal center B-cell like (“GCB”) sub-types by measuring the molecular profile of the tumor. These two subtypes display different clinical pathologies, as patients with the GCB subtype of DLBCL tend to respond differently than those of the ABC sub-type. With many of the large number of new DLBCL-targeting drugs appearing to have greater efficacy in one of the sub-types, a need for a reliable, FFPE-based cell of origin classification assay has emerged. The HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay is being utilized in numerous late-stage drug programs to stratify these patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq PATH Assay. The HTG EdgeSeq PATH Assay has been designed for retrospective gene expression profiling (“GEP”) to compliment traditional immunohistochemistry (“IHC”) testing by allowing investigators to assess mRNA expression of 470 targets when tissue availability is limited. The assay enables a wide variety of applications, including pre-screening of samples to guide subsequent testing and development of novel gene signatures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole-Transcriptome Assay. Human microRNAs are short non-coding strands of RNA that are believed to be used by the cell for gene regulation. The HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole-Transcriptome Assay enables the simultaneous profiling of 2,083 microRNAs, allowing new, potentially clinically relevant miRNA profiles to be discovered. Our ability to efficiently profile small FFPE samples is a significant differentiator in the rapidly growing microRNA market.

Our Technology
 HTG EdgeSeq Chemistry
 Our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry is shown schematically in the figure below. Specifically, DNA nuclease protection probes, or DNA protection probes, which include a target-specific region flanked by universal wing sequences are hybridized to targeted RNAs. Target RNA can be both soluble and cross-linked in the biological matrix. Universal DNA wingmen probes are hybridized to the wings to prevent S1 nuclease digestion. S1 nuclease is added to remove single-stranded nucleic acids, including unhybridized DNA protection probes and RNA. Following S1 nuclease treatment, the only remaining DNA protection probes in the reaction are those hybridized to targeted RNA and wingmen probes to form a hybridized complex. This produces an approximately 1:1 ratio of DNA protection probes to the RNA targeted in the sample. Alkaline hydrolysis of the hybridized complexes releases the DNA protection probes from such complexes. The released DNA protection probes are ready for quantitation. DNA protection probes are labeled with sequencing adaptors and tags in a thermocycler. The labeled DNA protection probes are concentrated, pooled, and ready for sequencing using standard NGS protocols. Data from the NGS instrument is processed and reported by the parser software provided with the HTG EdgeSeq system.

Key Advantages of our HTG EdgeSeq Chemistry
  
• | Multiplexing tens, hundreds or thousands of targets. Measuring multiple genes in a single reaction can be challenging with competitive technologies due to the complex interactions of reaction components. While we are currently marketing a panel with our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry that can profile up to 2,560 genes in a sample, we believe we can develop applications using our chemistry for multiplexing more than 2,560 genes if there is a customer need. The high level of gene multiplexing allows for significantly lower amounts of tissue to be used per sample than in competitive low-plex profiling technologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No RNA extraction. Competitive technologies for assessing RNA generally require RNA that is isolated and purified from other components found in the sample. These time-consuming steps may lead to some target loss and bias the test outcome. In FFPE tissues, for example, it has been reported that a fraction of the RNA is lost in the purification process because it cannot be separated from insoluble tissue components and the fixation and embedding process or long storage times for FFPE tissue may damage the RNA and break it into smaller, more difficult to analyze fragments. This makes molecular profiling of small FFPE tissues particularly challenging and can result in testing failures and loss of precious samples due to insufficient RNA recovery. These biases introduced by RNA extraction cannot be overcome and may be magnified throughout the subsequent analysis. Our proprietary chemistry does not require RNA extraction for FFPE samples or most other sample types (we recommend extracting RNA from fresh-frozen tissue samples to prevent processing variability) and improves utilization of precious samples, thereby improving workflow and reducing costs by eliminating a step known to bias the data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No cDNA synthesis. Many competitive technologies, most prominently qRT-PCR and traditional RNA sequencing, require conversion of RNA into DNA for analysis. This process, called reverse transcription, requires an enzyme to move along the extracted RNA to create a DNA copy of the molecule. When damaged and fragmented RNA is used, these small RNA strands become increasingly difficult to convert into DNA in an accurate and reproducible manner. Our proprietary chemistry does not require conversion of the RNA to DNA by reverse transcription, removing a technical difficulty experienced with competitive technologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Short protection probes. Many samples contain RNA degraded by various combinations of heat, age, poor processing, and fixation. In these samples, the RNA is damaged and fragmented into smaller strands. Utilizing short protection probes of 50 bases or less, we believe our proprietary chemistry is more efficient than competitive technologies that require longer strands of RNA for quantitation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simplicity. Our proprietary chemistry is simple, with fewer steps than competing technologies. Compared to qRT-PCR, our chemistry does not require extraction or cDNA synthesis. Compared to traditional RNA sequencing, our chemistry does not require extraction, cDNA synthesis, shearing, rRNA depletion, ligation, adenylation, or size selection. We believe that the accumulation of these steps required by other technologies results in amplification of biases, sample degradation and increased opportunities for technician error.

 Our assays and instruments were developed internally and are manufactured in Tucson, AZ under ISO 13485:2006 guidelines using our proprietary HTG EdgeSeq chemistry to simplify multiplexed nucleic acid testing in research and clinical laboratories. The entire workflow from sample preparation to a molecular profiling report can be accomplished in approximately 36 hours for 96 samples. With the speed, flexibility, sensitivity, and accuracy of our HTG EdgeSeq platform, combined with the system’s ability to work effectively with small sample volumes, researchers can profile tens, hundreds or thousands of different genes per sample.
 
The HTG EdgeSeq platform (shown above) consists of a processor, a host computer and integrated software. The processor is a fully automated instrument that prepares biological samples for quantitation using proprietary, electronically barcoded, single-use consumables. The processor has barcode scanner units to process the two-dimensional barcodes printed on the consumables loaded into the instrument. The barcoded consumables are single-use in order to reduce operator errors and provide chain of custody traceability for the samples. The robotic systems within the instrument are engineered for reliable performance and low maintenance. The walking path of the robot is programmed to minimize any chance of contamination of the reagents or samples. One host computer supports up to six processors allowing laboratories to easily expand their capacity by adding processors.
 Applications of our HTG EdgeSeq technology combine the HTG EdgeSeq processor with a NGS platform to enable the quantitative analysis of tens, hundreds or thousands of targeted RNAs in a single panel. The sample is prepared for quantitation on the processor, then labeled with molecular sequencing adaptors and tags. The labeled samples are concentrated, pooled, and sequenced on a NGS platform using standard protocols. Data from the NGS instrument are processed and reported by the parser software included with the system. HTG EdgeSeq assays currently are available to process sample batches ranging from eight to 96.
 In addition to direct sales of our systems, we utilize several alternative arrangements to sell our systems. Our platform can be purchased directly by our customers, who also then purchase HTG EdgeSeq assays and other consumables from us on an as-needed basis. In some instances, we provide our instruments free of charge on a limited basis to facilitate customer evaluation. We also may choose to install instruments for our customers at no cost, in exchange for an agreement to purchase assays and other consumables from us at a stated price over the term of the agreement or allow customers to rent our instrument for a monthly fee. As of December 31, 2018, we had an installed base of 49 instruments (consisting of 32 systems sold, three covered under reagent rental agreements, seven evaluation units and seven systems with key opinion leaders) and an additional three instruments installed at third-party sites in support of companion diagnostic collaboration projects.
 Opportunities for Comprehensive Molecular Profiling in Diagnostics
 We are planning to develop a portfolio of molecular diagnostic products using our proprietary technology to provide a single, efficient testing system for sample profiling that integrates seamlessly into a customer’s NGS testing workflow. 
 We are initially focused on areas where the diagnostic testing paradigm has significant inefficiencies. For example, many leading medical institutions are shifting from a single-drug / single-test approach to a broader tumor profiling strategy for their oncology practices. Rather than testing for single mutational analyses, such as KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer, these institutions use their NGS platforms to assess the mutational status of 50 or more genes. In addition, the information a physician needs to make clinical decisions often comes from tests conducted using various testing modalities such as IHC, FISH and NGS. These complexities lead to a growing and unmet demand in clinical diagnostics for more comprehensive molecular profiles that can include RNA expression, RNA fusions and rearrangements, DNA mutations and protein expression.

We completed the CE marking of the HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay EU in Europe in March 2017 as a companion diagnostic for ALK positive therapies in NSCLC lung cancer cases. Information on the ROS1, RET, NTRK1 and HER2 gene rearrangements included in the ALKPlus Assay panel is provided with RUO status. After obtaining the appropriate exemption(s), we believe the ROS1, RET, NTRK1 and HER2 gene rearrangements detected with the ALKPlus Assay could also be used for investigational use only for certain late-stage drug development trials, and, as appropriate, receive FDA approval in the future. Our PMA application for the HTG EdgeSeq AlkPlus Assay in the U.S. market, which we initiated in 2016, is currently on hold as we evaluate additional medical content for this assay. We also CE/IVD marked our HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL COO EU test in October 2015, which is utilized to differentiate the two main sub-types of DLBCL, ABC and GCB. We expect these two CE/IVD marked assays to begin generating revenue in 2019. 
 We have also initiated early development on a comprehensive assay intended to allow for breast cancer prognosis and prediction. Over the past decade, significant molecular information and understanding of breast cancer biology has emerged, which we believe has created a substantial opportunity to develop a broader and more comprehensive set of markers and signatures to support clinical decision making using a single panel. We estimate that this type of panel could serve a target market of nearly 400,000 patients in Europe and North America, alone; an available market of $200.0 million with the assumption of an average selling price per test of $500. 
 We are leveraging our platform to develop comprehensive molecular profiling panels across an increasing set of molecular applications, with initial focus in immuno-oncology and the identification of pathologies through molecular profiling (“next generation pathology”). In conjunction with our biopharmaceutical collaborators, we plan to develop novel RNA-based gene panels and possibly classifiers that can provide information about inflammation signatures and the molecular classification of tumors. Separately, we also plan to develop novel RNA-based gene panels designed for expanded applications in immune health monitoring and prescreening, detection of hyper-progression and predicting patient response to combination therapies. We believe that we will need to develop, refine and implement new panel protocols and make changes or adjustments to our chemistry and software to optimize these planned applications and panels for use with our HTG EdgeSeq system. We expect this to require substantial effort from our research scientists and the use of various laboratory equipment, supplies and materials, which together represent the most significant costs that we expect to incur in connection with the development of these applications and profiling panels.
 Serving the decentralized markets with Project JANUS
 In 2016, we began the development of our next generation instrument, referred to as Project JANUS, with the intent to potentially increase our addressable market for instrument sales to include the thousands of laboratories that make up the lower throughput clinical market. The molecular testing market is served by a mix of centralized reference laboratories, comprehensive cancer centers, and decentralized regional hospital laboratories. Volumes of particular case types and downstream testing needs for solid tumors are somewhat unpredictable for these providers. We believe Project JANUS would be well suited for managing low, medium, and surge testing volumes, thereby assisting our customers with this unpredictable aspect of their businesses. We expect testing panels for Project JANUS to include mutations, fusions, expression classifiers and a molecular surrogate for IHC. Upon development of this instrument, our approach would be to serve centralized markets with the HTG EdgeSeq system and expand service to the decentralized market of lower sample throughput laboratories with Project JANUS. Due to various research and development priorities, Project JANUS development efforts were put on hold during the third quarter of 2016. We intend to resume development efforts in accordance with development prioritization and availability of resources.
 Research and Development
 We have committed, and expect to commit, significant resources to developing new technologies and products, improving product performance and reliability and reducing costs. We have assembled an experienced research and development team with the scientific, engineering, software and process talent that we believe is required to successfully grow our business. As of December 31, 2018, our research and development team consisted of 40 employees across the disciplines of research and development scientist, platform development and bioinformatics.
 Our development team is responsible for clinical assay development services being performed for biopharmaceutical company customers, including those entered into in accordance with our Governing Agreement with QML. We believe these programs have the potential to generate future revenue through the sale of HTG EdgeSeq instruments and test kit annuities associated with a successfully approved companion diagnostic test as the related drug gains adoption. Our research efforts are currently focused on the expansion of our technology into new immune-oncology applications as well as other applications in solid and liquid biopsies, while working to continuously improve assay performance and probe design.

Sales and Marketing
 We distribute our instruments and consumables via direct sales in the United States and Europe and also through distributors in parts of Europe and other countries. As of December 31, 2018, our U.S. sales and marketing organization consisted of 19 employees including eight in direct sales or sales management, four in sales support and seven in marketing. In addition to our U.S. sales team, as of December 31, 2018, we had eight direct sales and support employees in Europe and distribution agreements in several additional countries. This sales model provides us with direct sales coverage in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and the Nordic countries, with distributors in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Israel.
 Our sales and marketing efforts target biopharmaceutical companies, clinical research centers and clinical diagnostic labs focused on sample profiling for translational research, biomarker/companion assay development and lab-developed diagnostic testing. We intend to promote adoption of our HTG EdgeSeq system, sample profiling panels and future molecular diagnostic assays upon marketing clearance or approval by the FDA, by expanding our U.S. sales force, building a greater direct sales presence in Europe, expanding international distribution and continuing to collaborate with key opinion leaders to validate our platform and to influence utilization of our products.
 Manufacturing and Suppliers
 We primarily manufacture our products within our facility in Tucson, AZ. External resources are leveraged for their specific expertise in either producing components for our HTG EdgeSeq instrument and raw materials for our consumables in accordance with our designs or based on their catalog products which are utilized as is within our designs. We manufacture HTG EdgeSeq instruments and reagent kits at our Tucson, Arizona facility, which has been certified to ISO 13485:2006 standards. We believe that our existing manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next several years.
Instruments
 We assemble our HTG EdgeSeq instruments at our Tucson, Arizona facility. We have qualified an alternative third-party manufacturer for our instruments and we believe additional instrument manufacturing alternatives would be available if necessary. Instrument component vendors are qualified and reviewed regularly to ensure that manufacturing standards are met and maintained. We award contracts for estimated annual quantities of components and, considering the replenishment lead times of our vendors, take delivery of batches covering approximately one month of demand at a time. 
Consumables
 We assemble our HTG EdgeSeq consumables at our Tucson, Arizona facility. Raw material vendors are selected using precise standards and are reviewed regularly for compliance with our specific quality requirements. We purchase raw material stock in quantities that often exceed projected annual demand. We complete batches of finished goods approximating quarterly demand and supervise inventory on a minimum/maximum basis to ensure that we are replenishing our finished goods and raw material ahead of demand.

 Agreements with Third Parties
 Asset Purchase Agreement with NuvoGen Research, LLC
 We entered an asset purchase agreement dated January 9, 2001, as amended in November 2003, September 2004, November 2012 and February 2014, with NuvoGen Research, LLC (“NuvoGen”) to acquire certain intellectual property from NuvoGen. The acquired technology generally relates to our former array-based nuclease protection panels. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, in exchange for the acquired technology, we initially paid NuvoGen 5,587 shares of our common stock, fixed payments of $740,000 over the first two years of the agreement and, thereafter, agreed to pay NuvoGen the greater of $400,000 per year or 6% of our annual revenue, until the total aggregate cash compensation paid to NuvoGen under the agreement equals $15,000,000. Pursuant to the latest amendment to the agreement, we paid NuvoGen an annual fixed fee of $800,000, in quarterly installments, for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, a revenue-based payment of $85,574 was made in the first quarter 2018, for the amount by which 6% of revenue exceeded the applicable fixed fee for the year ended December 31, 2017. Although the amendment allowed for the deferral of any accrued revenue-based payments through December 31, 2017, no revenue-based payments were deferred. Beginning in 2018, on an annual basis we are obligated to pay the greater of $400,000 or 6% of our annual revenue, until the total aggregate cash compensation paid to NuvoGen under the agreement totals $15,000,000. Revenue-based payments of $526,548 were made to NuvoGen during 2018 and an additional $363,686 was payable as of December 31, 2018, for the amount by which 6% of revenue exceeded the applicable fixed fee for revenue generated during the year ended December 31, 2018. As of January 1, 2018, and continuing until the remaining obligation has been paid in full, interest on the remaining unpaid obligation will accrue and compound annually at a rate of 2.5% per year. Accrued interest on this unpaid obligation is payable on the date that the remaining obligation is paid in full.
 In a transaction related to the foregoing acquisition, NuvoGen also received a non-exclusive, royalty free license under the acquired technology pursuant to an agreement dated September 15, 2004. The license is limited to NuvoGen’s own internal service-oriented efforts and activities to accelerate the development of targeted drugs and other pharmaceutical compounds and agents as part of NuvoGen’s grant funded or other basic research and development of drugs intended for the treatment of cancer. Pursuant to the agreement, if NuvoGen produces revenue through the sale of cancer drugs developed through use of the license for entities other than for-profit and other commercial drug-research and development service ventures, NuvoGen will pay us a royalty in the mid-single digit range percentage of such revenue for the quarter. This agreement may be terminated by either party in case of a breach by the other party, and we may terminate the agreement by giving written notice if NuvoGen files for bankruptcy or performs other similar actions.
 
MidCap Credit Facility
 On March 26, 2018 we entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (Term Loan) (the “MidCap Term Loan”) and a Credit and Security Agreement (Revolving Loan) (the “MidCap Revolving Loan” and together with the MidCap Term Loan, the “MidCap Credit Facility”) with MidCap Financial Trust, as agent. MidCap Financial Trust subsequently assigned its rights and obligations as agent to MidCap Funding IV Trust.
 The MidCap Term Loan provides a secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $20.0 million. We borrowed the first advance of $7.0 million (“MidCap Tranche 1”) on the closing date. Under the terms of the MidCap Term Loan, the second advance of $13.0 million (“MidCap Tranche 2”) will be available on or before September 30, 2019, subject to our satisfaction of certain conditions described in the MidCap Term Loan.
 MidCap Tranche 1 was used to repay in full all outstanding amounts and fees due under the Loan and Security Agreement we entered into in August 2014 with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank (the “Growth Term Loan”). The proceeds remaining from MidCap Tranche 1 and, if borrowed, the proceeds from MidCap Tranche 2, are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
 13


MidCap Tranche 1, and if borrowed, MidCap Tranche 2, each bear interest at a floating rate equal to 7.25% per annum, plus the greater of (i) 1.25% or (ii) the one-month London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”). Principal on each term loan advance is payable in 36 equal monthly installments beginning April 1, 2020 until paid in full on March 1, 2023. Prepayments of the term loans under the MidCap Term Loan, in whole or in part, will be subject to early termination fees in an amount equal to 3.0% of principal prepaid if prepayment occurs on or prior to the first anniversary of the MidCap Closing Date, 2.0% of principal prepaid if prepayment occurs after the first anniversary of the MidCap Closing Date but on or prior to the second anniversary of the MidCap Closing Date, and 1.0% of principal prepaid if prepayment occurs after the second anniversary of the MidCap Closing Date and prior to or on the third anniversary of the MidCap Closing Date. In connection with execution of the MidCap Term Loan, the Company paid MidCap a $100,000 origination fee. Upon termination of the MidCap Term Loan, the Company is required to pay an exit fee equal to 4.50% of the principal amount of all term loans advanced to us under the MidCap Term Loan.
 The MidCap Term Loan also required that we deliver subordination documents with respect to the QNAH Convertible Note, or that the QNAH Convertible Note otherwise be converted or prepaid, on or before June 30, 2018, and required us to deposit approximately $3.3 million into an escrow account by July 15, 2018 if neither event occurred by such date. As neither event occurred prior to June 30, 2018, we deposited approximately $3.3 million into an escrow account on July 11, 2018. Such escrowed funds will be released to the Company upon subsequent delivery of the requisite subordination documents or conversion of the QNAH Convertible Note. If neither delivery of the subordination documents or conversion of the QNAH Convertible Note occurs, such funds will be applied by the escrow agent to repay in full the QNAH Convertible Note at maturity (or in connection with a prepayment at the direction of the Company), subject to certain conditions described in the MidCap Term Loan. 
 The MidCap Revolving Loan provides a secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $2.0 million. We may request an increase in the total commitments under the MidCap Revolving Loan by up to an additional $8.0 million, subject to agent and lender approval and the satisfaction of certain conditions. Availability of the revolving credit facility under the MidCap Revolving Loan will be based upon a borrowing base formula and periodic borrowing base certifications valuing certain of our accounts receivable and inventory, as reduced by certain reserves, if any. The proceeds of any loans under the MidCap Revolving Loan may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
 Loans under the MidCap Revolving Loan accrue interest at a floating rate equal to 4.25% per annum, plus the greater of (i) 1.25% or (ii) the one-month LIBOR. Accrued interest on the revolving loans will be paid monthly and revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed until March 1, 2023, when all outstanding amounts must be repaid. Subject to certain exceptions, termination or permanent reductions of the revolving loan commitment under the MidCap Revolving Loan will be subject to termination fees in an amount equal to 3.0% of the commitment amount terminated or reduced if such termination or reduction occurs on or prior to the first anniversary of the MidCap Closing Date, 2.0% of the commitment amount terminated or reduced if such termination or reduction occurs after the first anniversary of the MidCap Closing Date but on or prior to the second anniversary of the MidCap Closing Date, and 1.0% of the commitment amount terminated or reduced if such termination or reduction occurs after the second anniversary of the MidCap Closing Date and prior to or on the third anniversary of the MidCap Closing Date.
 In connection with the MidCap Revolving Loan, we are required to pay customary fees, including an origination fee of 0.50% of the original commitment amount at closing (and an equivalent origination fee with respect to any increased commitments at the time of the applicable increase), a monthly unused line fee of 0.50% per annum based upon the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility and a monthly collateral management fee of 0.50% per annum based upon the average daily used portion of the revolving credit facility. We are also required to maintain a minimum drawn balance of not less 20% of availability under the revolving line. If we do not maintain such minimum drawn balance, it is required to pay monthly interest and fees as if an amount equal to 20% of availability had been drawn down under the revolving line.
 Our obligations under the MidCap Credit Facility are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). Additionally, our future subsidiaries may be required to become co-borrowers or guarantors under the MidCap Credit Facility.
 The MidCap Credit Facility contains customary affirmative covenants and customary negative covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, dispose of assets, undergo a change in control, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, incur debt, incur liens, pay dividends, repurchase stock and make investments, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Commencing with the calendar quarter ending on the later of (a) June 30, 2019 and (b) the last day of the calendar quarter in which MidCap Tranche 2 is funded, we must also comply with a financial covenant relating to trailing twelve-month minimum Net Revenue requirements (as defined in the MidCap Credit Facility), tested on a quarterly basis.
 14


The MidCap Credit Facility also contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants, a material adverse change, delisting of our common stock, bankruptcy and insolvency, cross defaults with certain material indebtedness and certain material contracts, judgments, and inaccuracies of representations and warranties. Upon an event of default, agent and the lenders may declare all or a portion of our outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the agreement. During the existence of an event of default, interest on the obligations could be increased by 3.0%.
 
We granted the lender ten-year warrants to purchase 18,123 shares of our common stock at $7.73 per share as a result of Tranche 1. Upon drawdown of Tranche 2, we will issue additional ten-year warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount equal to 2.0% of the amount drawn, divided by the exercise price per share for that tranche (defined as 1.5 times the volume-weighted average closing price of our common stock for the ten business days immediately preceding the business day before the issue date). The fair value of the warrants on the date of issuance was approximately $74,000, determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and was recorded as a discount to the MidCap Term Loan.
 LIBOR, which is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally, is currently scheduled to be phased out in 2021. Before LIBOR is phased out, we may need to renegotiate the MidCap Credit Facility to replace LIBOR with a new standard, which has yet to be established. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could result in higher interest rates on our loans under the MedCap Credit Facility.
 Development and Component Supply Agreement with Illumina, Inc.
 In June 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Development and Component Supply Agreement with Illumina, Inc. (“Illumina”), effective May 31, 2017 (the “Restated Agreement”), which amended and restated our IVD Test Development and Component Supply Agreement originally entered into with Illumina in October 2014 (the “Original Agreement”). The Restated Agreement provides for the development and worldwide commercialization by the Company of nuclease-protection-based RNA or DNA profiling tests (“IVD test kits”) for use with Illumina’s MiSeqDx sequencer in the field of diagnostic oncology testing in humans (the “Field”).
 Under the Restated Agreement, the parties have agreed to continue activities under the first development plan which was entered into pursuant to the Original Agreement relating to our HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay. In addition, we may, at our discretion, submit additional development plans for IVD test kits in the Field to Illumina for its approval, not to be unreasonably withheld.
 Under each development plan, Illumina will provide specified regulatory support and rights, and develop and deliver to us an executable version of custom software, which, when deployed on Illumina’s MiSeqDx sequencer, would enable sequencing by the end-user of the subject IVD test kit probe library. Illumina retains ownership of the custom software, subject to our right to use the custom software in connection with the commercialization of IVD test kits. We are required to pay fees to Illumina upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones relating to the IVD test kits, though none of these regulatory milestones have been reached through December 31, 2018. We have also agreed to pay Illumina a single digit percentage royalty on net sales of any IVD test kits that we commercialize pursuant to the Restated Agreement.
 Absent earlier termination, the Restated Agreement will expire in May 2027; however, Illumina is no longer obligated to notify us of changes in its products that may affect our IVD test kits after May 31, 2023. We may terminate the Restated Agreement at any time upon 90 days’ written notice and may terminate any development plan under the Restated Agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice. Illumina may terminate the Restated Agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice if we undergo certain changes of control, subject to a transition period of up to 12 months for then-ongoing development plans. Either party may terminate the Restated Agreement upon the other party’s material breach of the Restated Agreement that remains uncured for 30 days, or upon the other party’s bankruptcy.
 QIAGEN Agreements
 Governing Agreement
 In November 2016, we entered the Governing Agreement with QML. The Governing Agreement creates a framework for the companies to combine their technological and commercial strengths to offer biopharmaceutical companies a complete NGS-based solution for the development, manufacture and commercialization of companion diagnostic assays. Under the Governing Agreement, the parties jointly seek companion diagnostic programs with biopharmaceutical companies, QML enters into sponsor project agreements with interested biopharmaceutical companies for specified projects, and we and QML enter into statements of work, that set forth the rights and obligations of each party with respect to each project.
 15


The parties’ relationship under the Governing Agreement is exclusive in the oncology field. Such exclusivity in the oncology field may be lost and become non-exclusive if certain performance targets are not met. Projects may be undertaken in non-oncology fields at each party’s discretion on a non-exclusive basis.
 We and QML share net profits under each statement of work, at a percentage that primarily depends on which company’s intellectual property forms the basis for the particular assay under the applicable statement of work. Each statement of work provides additional financial terms for the corresponding project, which terms depend on the respective development and/or commercialization activities of the parties.
 The Governing Agreement has a five-year term, though either party may terminate the Governing Agreement upon (i) the other party’s uncured material breach, bankruptcy or insolvency, (ii) specified events affecting all statements of work, or (iii) a change of control by either party, except neither party will have such change of control termination right to the extent the Governing Agreement relates to one of the statements of work entered into under the agreement. In the event a party terminates the Governing Agreement for its own change of control, a $2.0 million termination payment will be payable to the non-terminating party. 
 We have entered into three statements of work under the Governing Agreement to date, of which two remained active as of December 31, 2018. For additional information relating to the statements of work associated with our Governing Agreement see Item 8, “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
 Stock Purchase Agreement
 Pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, entered concurrent with the Governing Agreement, QIAGEN North American Holdings, Inc. (“QNAH”) another wholly owned subsidiary of QIAGEN N.V., purchased 833,333 shares of our common stock on November 17, 2016 at $2.40 per share, for a total purchase price of $2.0 million. The purchase price for the shares of common stock purchased by QNAH on November 17, 2016 reflected the parties’ agreement as to the fair market value of the shares as of the closing. However, the portion of the purchase price per share that exceeded the most recently reported closing price of our common stock, or $175,000 in the aggregate, was attributed to the Governing Agreement and recorded as deferred revenue to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the Governing Agreement’s five-year term. No additional shares of our common stock were purchased by QNAH in the second tranche closing allowed for in this agreement and QNAH had no further obligation to purchase our common stock under the agreement.
QNAH Convertible Note Agreement
 In October 2017, we issued a subordinated convertible promissory note (the “QNAH Convertible Note”) to QNAH in the principal amount of $3.0 million against receipt of cash proceeds equal to such principal amount. The QNAH Convertible Note bears simple interest at the rate of 3.0% per annum and matures on October 26, 2020. QNAH may elect to convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal balance of the QNAH Convertible Note and all unpaid accrued interest thereon at any time prior to the maturity date into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $3.984 per share.
 Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 Clinical laboratories acquire our instrumentation through a capital purchase, capital lease or reagent purchasing agreement. These laboratories offer their customers a menu of testing services using our IVD test kits or their LDTs, which they may develop using components they purchase from us, or a combination of both. Our customers generate revenue for these testing services by collecting payments from third-party payors, including public and private payors, as well as patient co-payments.
 United States
 In the United States, molecular testing laboratories have multiple options for reimbursement coding, but we expect that the primary codes used will be the Genomic Sequencing Procedure codes. We are also monitoring the Protecting Access to Medicare Act implementation as well as the recent National Coverage Determination for NGS testing by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”).
 16


Genomic Sequencing Procedures.
 The AMA created codes for Genomic Sequencing Procedures (“GSPs”) and other Molecular Multianalyte Assays as part of its calendar year 2015 update to the clinical laboratory fee schedule. AMA has since modified the GSP codes to clarify the definition to include DNA and RNA. Our customers may use these codes to seek reimbursement for diagnostic multi-analyte test offerings, such as:

• | Gene expression classifiers for hematolymphoid neoplasms, such as the determination of ABC or GCB subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gene rearrangements in solid tumors and hematolymphoid neoplasms; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutations in solid tumors and hematolymphoid neoplasms.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 Payments for Tier 1 and Tier 2 Molecular Pathology Procedures and GSPs may be sought from both public and private payors. Claims for Medicare coverage are processed by private Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) such as Novitas and Cahaba, and coverage for specific test codes are specified in Local Coverage Determinations (“LCDs”) issued by individual MACs or National Coverage Determinations (“NCDs”) which apply to all MACs. Private payors issue their own coverage determinations that are largely reflective of the CMS LCDs and NCDs. HTG closely monitors trends in coverage through interactions with customers, industry associations such as the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (“AMP”) and industry consultants; these trends are key considerations in our product development plans.
 Our customers may use our products, if approved, and subject to regulatory limitations, to offer testing services that provide an analysis of 5‑50 genes as well as 51 or more genes. In October 2014, CMS released its preliminary determinations regarding the method for determining 2015 payment rates for new codes under the clinical laboratory fee schedule. CMS recommended that payment rates for GSPs be determined through a process known as gapfill rather than by crosswalking to allow CMS and its contractors to gather information about the manner in which the tests are performed and the resources necessary to provide them, so that ultimately CMS can set an appropriate payment rate for these tests. In the gapfill process, the local MACs determine the appropriate fee schedule amounts in the first year, and CMS calculates a national payment rate based on the median of these local fee schedule amounts in the second year. On September 22, 2017, gapfill pricing for CPTs 81445 and 81450 for the assessment of 5-50 genes in solid and liquid tumors, respectively, were set at $598 and $760, respectively, and remains the same as of December 31, 2018. CPT 81455 for the assessment of 51 or more genes in solid and liquid tumors was set at $2,920.
 In 2018, CMS released its NCD for reimbursement of CDx tests in oncology. We believe this was a very important event as many of the diagnostic assays that we are in the process of developing are expected to be oncology CDx tests which would be addressed in this NCD. 
 We believe that establishment of the aforementioned reimbursement codes specific to genomic sequencing procedures such as our CDx tests currently in development is an important factor in expanding access to our products. In addition, coverage and reimbursement of our tests by government and private payors is essential to our commercial success. Accordingly, our strategy includes efforts to encourage third-party payors to establish coverage, coding and payment that will facilitate access to our tests as we seek FDA approval for these tests and expand our commercialization efforts in the United States. Our success in these efforts depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for tests using our technology. Failure by our customers who use our tests to obtain coverage and sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payors or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ policies would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects.
 Outside the United States
 Our target markets outside of the United States are Europe and Asia/Pacific. Our diagnostic product menu plans for Europe and Asia/Pacific consist primarily of NGS‑based test kits that will satisfy existing or emerging testing demand, and we expect to be competing based on testing efficiency, quality and price. 
 In Europe, coverage for molecular diagnostic testing is varied. Countries with statutory health insurance (e.g., Germany, France, The Netherlands) tend to be more progressive in technology adoption with favorable reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing. In countries such as the United Kingdom with tax-based insurance, adoption and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing is not uniform and is influenced by local budgets.
 17


Failure by our ex-U.S. customers to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our diagnostic products from healthcare payors or adverse changes in government and private payors’ policies would have a material adverse effect on our ex-U.S. growth prospects and our overall business, financial condition and results of operations.
Government Regulation – Medical Device Regulations
 United States
 Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign authorities. Currently we are limited to marketing our products in the United States for research use only, which means that we cannot make any diagnostic or clinical claims. However, we intend to seek regulatory clearances or approvals in the United States and other jurisdictions to market certain assays for diagnostic purposes. The companion diagnostic tests under development by HTG are classified as “medical devices” under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of such products for their intended use.
 Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA submission can be expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
 Device Classification
 Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes – Class I, Class II or Class III – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
 Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
 Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and post market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” as defined in the statute, to either:
  
• | a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
 18


After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite PMA application(s). In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements.
 The PMA Process
 If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
 Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally costlier and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical study data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
 In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical studies intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) application. Some types of studies deemed to present “non-significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and Institutional Review Board approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical studies. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects. Generally, clinical studies for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical study sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical studies, and although the FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
 Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If the PMA application is determined to be sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (e.g. major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory panel may be convened to review the PMA and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. This advisory panel may also involve a public meeting if FDA determines public input is required. Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of the clinical study data and clinical study sites, and a QSR inspection of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
  
• | the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical studies may be insufficient to support approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19


 
• | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, which usually contains several conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional analytical studies or clinical studies are necessary, in which case approval of the PMA submission may be delayed for several months or years while the analytical studies and/or trials are conducted and data are submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.
 New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modification to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
 In approving a PMA application, the FDA may also require some form of post market studies or post market surveillance, whereby the applicant follows certain patient groups for several years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. FDA may also require post market surveillance for certain devices cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life-sustaining devices used outside a device user facility. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:
  
• | the registration and listing regulation, which requires manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow elaborate design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advertising and promotion requirements;
--+----------------------------------------


• | restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | PMA annual reporting requirements;
--+-----------------------------------


• | the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an order of repair, replacement or refund;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | device tracking requirements; and
--+----------------------------------


• | post-approval study and post market surveillance requirements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 20


Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with the applicable United States medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, unanticipated expenditures, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.
 Research Use Only
 An RUO product is one that is not intended for clinical diagnostic use and must be labeled “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” Products that are intended for research use only and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA requirements discussed above, including the approval or clearance and QSR requirements. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDC Act and is subject to FDA enforcement activities. The FDA may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed, when determining its intended use.
European Union
 The European Union (“EU”) has also adopted requirements that affect our products. These requirements include establishing standards that address creating a certified quality system as well as several directives that address specific product areas. The most significant of these currently effective directives is the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (“IVDD”) which includes:

• | Essential Requirements. The IVDD specifies “essential requirements” that all medical devices must meet. The requirements are similar to those adopted by the FDA relating to quality systems and product labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conformity Assessment. Unlike United States regulations, which require virtually all devices to undergo some level of premarket review by the FDA, the IVDD currently allows manufacturers to bring many devices to market using a process in which the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the IVDD for that device. A small number of products must go through a more formal pre-market review process. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the EU and European Economic Area.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vigilance. The IVDD also specifies requirements for post market reporting similar to those adopted by the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On May 26, 2017, the EU released a new regulatory framework, the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (“IVDR”) which is expected to replace IVDD. Our products in the EU will have to comply with the IVDR requirements after May 26, 2022. Until that time, our products must continue to meet the requirements of IVDD for commercialization in the EU. 
 Other International
 Several other countries, including Australia, Canada, China and Japan, have adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for medical devices sold in those countries. Many of these standards are loosely patterned after those adopted by the EU, but with elements unique to each country. Although there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards, regulations in each country may vary substantially, which can affect timelines of introduction. We routinely monitor these developments and address compliance with the various country requirements as new standards are adopted.
Government Regulation – Fraud and Abuse and Other Healthcare Regulation
 We may be subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback laws. Penalties for violations of these healthcare laws include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.
 21


Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service, or for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending, any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The term “remuneration” expressly includes kickbacks, bribes, or rebates and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value.
 There are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more applicable statutory exceptions or regulatory safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, (collectively the “ACA”) to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the intent to induce referrals need only be “one purpose” of the remuneration for violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act which is discussed below.
Federal Civil False Claims Act
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from or approval by the Federal Government. Suits filed under the federal civil False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers”, may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend a case brought under the federal civil False Claim Act. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant civil penalties for each separate false claim. Many comparable state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the Federal Government.
Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition
 We are also subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits, among other things, physicians who have a financial relationship, including an investment, ownership or compensation relationship with an entity, from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to the entity for designated health services, which include clinical laboratory services, unless an exception applies. Similarly, entities may not bill Medicare, Medicaid or any other party for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all third-party payors, not just Medicare and Medicaid.
Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute
 The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, among other things, imposes fines against any person or entity who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
 The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) created several additional federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 22


In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their implementing regulations established uniform standards for covered entities, which are certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve the creation, use, maintenance or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. Among other things, HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. The EU has established its own data security and privacy legal framework, including but not limited to Directive 95/46/EC (“Data Protection Directive”). The Data Protection Directive was replaced in May 2018 with the recently adopted European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, higher sanctions and extra-territoriality measures intended to bring non-EU companies under the regulation. Over time we may expand our business operations to include additional operations in the EU. With such expansion, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation, including the GDPR, in the EU countries in which we operate.
 The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act
 The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to CMS, information related to “payments or other transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians, as defined above, and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in significant civil monetary penalties.
State Law Equivalents
 Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, as well as laws that restrict our marketing activities with health care professionals and entities, and require us to track and report payments and other transfers of value, including consulting fees, provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Some states mandate implementation of compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws. We also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws, which vary by country. We may be subject to certain state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 California recently enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. When it goes into effect on January 1, 2020, the CCPA will require covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. Legislators have stated that amendments will be proposed to the CCPA before it goes into effect, but it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. As currently written, the CCPA may impact (possibly significantly) our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.
 Healthcare Reform
 In March 2010, President Obama enacted the ACA, which is substantially changing healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers and is significantly impacting the medical device industry. The ACA’s provisions of importance to our business include, but are not limited to, a deductible 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, which became effective January 1, 2013. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, signed into law in December 2015, includes a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax that applies between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017. Further, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018, the 2018 Appropriations Resolution, that extended the moratorium on the medical device excise tax through December 31, 2019. Absent further legislative action, the tax will be automatically reinstated for medical device sales beginning January 1, 2020.

Since its enactment in 2010, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provision of the ACA and otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, the 2018 Appropriations Resolution delays the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including, without limitation, the medical device excise tax. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace ACA will impact ACA.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, following the passage of other legislative amendments, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 The full impact of the ACA, its possible repeal, and any legislation passed to replace the ACA, as well as other laws and reform measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future, remains uncertain, but may continue the downward pressure on medical device pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Employees
 Our ability to retain current talent and recruit new employees into our Company is a critical factor in our continued growth and performance improvement. We continue to initiate programs to promote our organizational culture and to identify the best possible new talent as the organization grows and new positions are made available. As of December 31, 2018, we had 107 full-time and two part-time employees, of which 14 are employed in administration, 23 in manufacturing and operations, 40 in research and development, five in regulatory and quality affairs, and 27 in s
ales and marketing. Seven of these employees were located in Europe and all others were located in the United States. We believe that our success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have never experienced a work stoppage due to labor difficulties and believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions. Collective bargaining is established by law in France. We and our French employees have agreed to the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements.
