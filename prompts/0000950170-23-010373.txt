 Item 1. Business.
 Overview and History
 Excelerate Energy, Inc. offers flexible LNG solutions, providing integrated services along the LNG value chain. We offer a full range of flexible regasification services from FSRUs to infrastructure development, to LNG and natural gas supply. Excelerate was incorporated on September 10, 2021, as a Delaware corporation. Excelerate was formed as a holding company to own, as its sole material asset, a controlling equity interest in EELP, a Delaware limited partnership formed in December 2003 by George B. Kaiser (together with his affiliates other than the Company, “Kaiser”).
 On April 18, 2022, Excelerate closed its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 18,400,000 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock at an offering price of $24.00 per share, pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-262065), and its prospectus (the “Prospectus”), dated April 12, 2022 and filed on April 14, 2022 with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act. The IPO generated gross proceeds of $441.6 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $25.4 million and IPO-related expenses of $7.6 million.
 As a result of the IPO, Excelerate became the general partner of EELP. As we operate and control all of EELP’s business and affairs, we consolidate the financial results of EELP and report non-controlling interests related to the interests held by the other partners of EELP in our consolidated financial statements. The IPO was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control. As a result, the consolidated financial statements of Excelerate recognize the assets and liabilities received in the reorganization at their historical carrying amounts, as reflected in the historical consolidated financial statements of EELP. The approximately 24.2% of EELP partnership interests owned by us are classified as Class A interests. The remaining approximately 75.8% of EELP interests are owned by Excelerate Energy Holdings, LLC (“EE Holdings”), an entity owned and controlled by Kaiser, and are classified as Class B interests.
 Our Company
 Excelerate is changing the way the world accesses cleaner and more reliable energy by delivering regasified natural gas, benefiting hundreds of millions of people around the world. From our founding, we have focused on providing flexible LNG solutions to markets in diverse environments across the globe, providing a lesser emitting form of energy to markets that often rely on coal as their primary energy source. At Excelerate, we believe that access to reliable energy such as LNG is critical to assisting markets in their decarbonization efforts, while at the same time promoting economic growth and improving quality of life.
 We have grown our business significantly since our first FSRU charter in 2003, and today, we are a profitable energy company with a geographically diversified business model. Our business spans the globe, with regional offices in 11 countries and operations in Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Finland, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), and the United States. We are the largest provider of regasified LNG in Argentina and Bangladesh and one of the largest providers of regasified LNG in Brazil and Pakistan, and we operate the largest FSRU in Brazil. We also have access to downstream markets in New England through our Northeast Gateway Deepwater Port (“NEG”) and in Brazil through the lease of an LNG terminal in Bahia, Brazil (the “Bahia Terminal”) from Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”). In December 2021, we began importing LNG and selling natural gas to the Brazilian market. In December 2022, we began importing and selling natural gas and LNG into Europe via the Inkoo Terminal in Finland. We also have plans to sell natural gas to other downstream customers in Brazil, Europe and Bangladesh. In each of these regions, we offer a cleaner energy source from which power can be generated consistently. The high value our customers place on our services has resulted in a reliable source of revenues to us, while our global reach helps balance seasonal demand fluctuation among the geographies in which we operate.
 Our business focuses on the integration of the natural gas-to-power LNG value chain, and as part of this value chain, we operate regasification terminals in global economies that utilize our FSRU fleet. Our business is substantially supported by time charter contracts, which are effectively long-term, take-or-pay arrangements and provide consistent revenue and cash flow from our high-quality customer base. As of December 31, 2022, we operate a fleet of ten purpose-built FSRUs, have completed more than 2,500 ship-to-ship (“STS”) transfers of LNG with over 40 LNG operators since we began operations and safely delivered more than 6,000 billion cubic feet (“BCF”) of natural gas through 16 LNG terminals.
 We also procure LNG from major producers and sell natural gas through our flexible LNG terminals. The commercial momentum that we have established in recent years and the increasing need for access to LNG around the world have resulted in a significant portfolio of new growth opportunities for us to pursue. In addition to our FSRU and terminal services businesses and natural gas sales, we plan to expand our business to provide customers with an array of products, including LNG-to-power projects.
 Our integrated LNG solutions are designed to avoid the roadblocks that routinely hinder the development of terminal, gas and power projects in markets worldwide. We offer enhanced energy security and independence to the countries in which we operate, while playing a vital role in advancing their efforts to lower carbon emissions and comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change. From our global experience, we see firsthand the impact of providing local communities with a reliable source of energy and the subsequent

development of natural gas and power infrastructure to take advantage of the natural gas we deliver to them. With improved access to cleaner and more reliable energy, countries are able to power industries, light homes and bolster economies. Additionally, some of the markets in which we operate lack developed energy infrastructure and therefore rely heavily on our services.
 We seek to optimize our LNG portfolio and fleet flexibility to deliver the best solutions that scale with our customers’ needs. We believe that LNG will play a critical part in the global transition to a lower-carbon future. Even the most aggressive scenarios that call for a larger role for renewables and new technology in decarbonization efforts fail to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goals without substantial growth in natural gas volumes, including in the form of LNG, through 2040. While more aggressive mandates to shift electricity generation away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources are possible, as a pioneer in flexible LNG solutions, we are well positioned to support society’s transition to a lower-carbon energy future.
 FSRU Fleet
 As of December 31, 2022, our fleet includes ten FSRUs. All of the vessels in our fleet were built by leading Korean shipyards and were delivered to us as new vessels in the year of delivery set forth in the table below. Excelerate is the sole owner of seven FSRUs and charters three others: the Experience, through a long-term charter that is a finance lease from a third party, the Sequoia, through a five-year charter (including a purchase option, which we exercised in March 2023) from a third party, and the Exquisite, through a 45% ownership interest through a joint venture with Nakilat Excelerate LLC (the “Nakilat JV”). In October 2022, we signed an agreement with Hyundai Heavy Industries (“HHI”) for a new FSRU to be delivered in 2026.
 In addition to standard LNG carrier functionality, our purpose-built FSRUs have the onboard capability to vaporize LNG and deliver natural gas through specially designed offshore and near-shore receiving facilities. Our FSRUs can deliver natural gas at pipeline pressure with maximum send-out capacities ranging from 600 million standard cubic feet per day (“MMscf/d”) to up to 1,200 MMscf/d continuously, providing quick and convenient access to incremental natural gas supplies.
 The table below sets forth information about each of our owned and chartered FSRUs.

 (1)Peak send-out capacity dependent on local conditions, including operating pressure and seawater temperature. 
 (2)Represents the number of ports where each vessel has provided regasification services throughout its lifetime. 
 The technical design of our FSRU fleet allows us to optimize fleet allocation, minimize disruption risks through vessel commonality and operate flexibly. Our vessels are designed to move seamlessly from one location to another and operate in a wide array of weather, locations and seawater temperatures. For example, depending on environmental conditions and local sea water temperature, our FSRUs can be operated in open-loop (i.e., using existing sea water as the heating medium) or closed-loop (i.e., recirculating loop for freshwater onboard, heated by ship’s systems) mode. Closed-loop mode is usually required for colder water temperatures.
 By managing the day-to-day operations of our FSRUs, we offer our customers a commitment to operational excellence and a consistent approach to seagoing and shore-based personnel development, and we endeavor to continually improve our environmental and safety culture and standards, including reducing environmental impacts from our operations and assets and enhancing our monitoring and reporting of emissions and ecological impacts.
 Natural Gas and LNG Sales
 Natural Gas Sales
 Through the Bahia Terminal, NEG, and the Inkoo Terminal, we have sold natural gas and LNG into the local downstream markets over the past two years. We are actively developing additional terminals with integrated natural gas sales as well as agreements to access capacity on existing terminals where we already provide regasification services. Our gas sales contracts look to minimize commodity price exposure and we negotiate sales prices on a fixed basis. We intend to maximize the value of these opportunities by leveraging our

network of existing relationships to procure LNG from the international market and by using terminal capacity that has not been assigned to anchor offtakers or adding extra capacity.
 LNG Marketing and Chartering
 Our LNG marketing and chartering capabilities allow us to develop LNG procurement and logistical strategies aligned with our downstream customers’ goals. Our services provide customers with the required visibility into the LNG market, allowing them to leverage our access to established relationships and logistical expertise. We support new customers with LNG adoption in markets where LNG procurement is still developing or growing. Utilizing established relationships across the globe, we partner with our customers to create optimal solutions based on their needs. Through our global portfolio, we aim to deliver flexible and reliable solutions.
 LNG Supply Capabilities
 Our commercial team has extensive experience sourcing LNG, utilizing extensive, established relationships across the international natural gas industry. We have approximately 70 master LNG sale and purchase agreements that enable us to buy and sell LNG to ensure adequate supply to our customers. Our operations team has a strong track record of managing loading, transport and delivery logistics so that cargo supplies are timely and power plant requirements and downstream commitments are met.
 In February 2023, we executed a 20-year LNG sales and purchase agreement with Venture Global LNG (“Venture Global SPA”). Under the Venture Global SPA, Excelerate will purchase 0.7 MT per annum of LNG on a free-on-board (“FOB”) basis from the Plaquemines LNG facility in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. These LNG volumes will support our efforts to balance the predictable margins from our regasification agreements with upside opportunities from gas sales. As we grow our business, we are taking a very deliberate and structured approach to sourcing LNG supply. Our intention is to actively manage the downstream demand with LNG supply. Building a diversified LNG supply portfolio will allow us to offer more flexible and cost-effective products to both existing and new customers in downstream markets.
 Customers and Contracts
 Our customers are a mix of state owned oil and gas companies, transmission operators and industrial users of natural gas. Our LNG solutions provide flexible natural gas supply to countries that seek reliable natural gas and power to ensure their energy security. We typically enter into take-or-pay contracts for FSRU long-term charters and integrated LNG terminals. The rates we charge customers are typically based on the economic return requirements for our investments in FSRUs, terminals, pipelines and onshore facilities. Our strategy of operating our FSRUs as an integrated fleet gives us a risk mitigation tool, reducing redeployment risk after the end of a contract as well as reducing the adverse effects of a potential disruption on a current contract.
 Our FSRU services are provided to the applicable charterer under separate time charters. A time charter is a contract for the use of an FSRU for a fixed period of time at a specified hire rate per day, which is typically fixed. Under a time charter, we provide the crew, technical and other services related to the FSRU’s operation, the costs of which are included in the hire rate, and the charterer generally is responsible for substantially all of the FSRU voyage costs (including fuel, docking costs, port and canal fees and LNG boil-off). Time charter contracts may be terminated due to material breach, change in law, extended force majeure and other typical termination events. Some customers may also terminate their time charter contracts in advance upon expiration of a period ranging from four to 10 years and payment of associated early termination fees. However, we regularly negotiate with our customers to amend our time charters and extend their terms and termination periods.
 As of December 31, 2022, nine of our FSRUs are contracted and are either in place and delivering natural gas on demand or are in the process of transitioning to their next assignment. We currently have contracts with customers in Argentina, Brazil, Bangladesh, Finland, Germany, Pakistan and the UAE, all of which are long-term time charter contracts. In addition, the Sequoia is being utilized to sell natural gas at the Bahia Terminal in Brazil.
 As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining term of these contracts is 6.3 years. The stable nature of our FSRU revenue stream is underscored by the critical nature of the services we provide to our customers, which are often in markets which lack natural gas supply optionality. Additionally, our history of operational excellence and our reputation with host governments have resulted in contract renewals, capacity expansions, and other opportunities to meeting our customers’ increasing needs for cleaner

energy. We regularly engage our customers to negotiate potential extensions of our contracts, and many of our older contracts have already been extended. The table below shows the status of our FSRU contract terms as of March 23, 2023:
 
As we continue to expand our market presence downstream of our terminals with incremental investments in natural gas pipelines and power plants, we expect that a growing number of our customers will include counterparties to gas sales agreements and power purchase agreements. Starting in December 2021, we commenced natural gas sales to new customers from the Bahia Terminal in Brazil. In December 2022, we began selling LNG and natural gas into Europe through the Finland terminal.
 Excelerate also generates revenues by selling LNG cargos throughout the world. These contracts have been performed under existing Master LNG Sale and Purchase Agreements that Excelerate has in place with different industry players. Cargos have been sold at Delivery ex-Ship basis while purchases have been a mixture of FOB and Delivery ex-Ship.
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe we are well positioned to achieve our primary business objectives and execute our business strategies based on the following competitive strengths:
 •Experienced LNG Leader and Proven Ability to Execute. We are an admired player within the LNG industry with significant experience across the value chain. Our experienced team and proven LNG solutions, including one of the largest FSRU fleets employed for regasification, more than 2,500 STS transfers of LNG with over 40 LNG operators and the development or operation of 16 LNG import terminals, make us a market leader and a trusted partner for countries that seek to improve their access to energy. We have nearly two decades of development, construction and operational experience, making us one of the most accomplished, reliable and capable LNG companies in the industry. Our team’s in-depth experience and local presence enable us to support energy hubs by sourcing and aggregating LNG from the global market for delivery downstream, ensuring the long-term stability, reliability, and independence of customers’ energy supply.


•Positioned to Meet Growing Global Demand for Cleaner Energy. According to the International Energy Agency’s February 2023 semi-annual Electricity Market Report, global electricity demand rose by almost 2% in 2022 compared with the 2.4% average growth rate seen between 2015 through 2019. Global electricity demand is expected to grow at a higher rate of 3% per year during 2023 through 2025. With the demand for power generation growing worldwide, direct access to diverse, reliable energy sources such as LNG has become a critical enabler for economic growth and improving the quality of life across the globe. LNG provides an abundant, competitive and cleaner energy source to meet the world’s growing demand for power. It is also an efficient means to displace coal, which is a higher carbon intensity fuel compared to natural gas. Despite its advantages, LNG access is not readily available in many emerging markets due to the complexity of LNG import projects. We have an established reputation for developing and operating complex LNG solutions and are a trusted operator with a strong track record of bringing reliability, resiliency and flexibility to energy systems.
 •Full-Service, Integrated LNG Business Model Provides Competitive Advantage. As market dynamics and the energy needs of customers have evolved over time, we embraced the opportunity to expand beyond our FSRU business. Today, we are addressing the need for increased access to LNG with our fully integrated business model that manages the LNG supply chain from procurement until final delivery to end users. We help our customers meet their growing energy demand by providing an array of products, including LNG terminal services and natural gas supply procurement and distribution. By offering our customers flexible, fully integrated and tailored LNG solutions, we are able to increase the financial value of these opportunities while enabling our customers to safely and efficiently access the energy they need.
 •Well-Established FSRU Business Supported by Dependable Revenue Base. We own and operate one of the largest FSRU fleets employed for regasification in the industry. The success of our well-established FSRU business is highlighted by our ability to secure long-term, take-or-pay contracts that generate consistent revenue and cash flow with minimal exposure to commodity price volatility. Our ability to swap FSRUs between projects makes our baseline revenue more predictable and minimizes redeployment risk. Further, we minimize the initial commitments for integrated offerings through the initial use of existing, smaller capacity FSRUs while our customers’ markets evolve. Most of our existing customers have benefited from this scalability, which has resulted in better project returns and higher customer loyalty. This strength has allowed us to capture downstream markets such as Brazil, where our successful FSRU services with Petrobras opened the door to accessing gas sales through the lease of the Bahia Terminal from Petrobras. Our profitable FSRU and LNG marketing and supply businesses also provide us with valuable connectivity to global downstream markets. With our expansive global presence, we are well positioned to deliver integrated natural gas and power solutions, giving our customers access to cleaner and more reliable energy.
 •Understanding of LNG Market Dynamics Allows for Portfolio Optimization. We leverage our expertise and understanding of LNG market dynamics to create significant value through our LNG marketing and supply business. Our worldwide market access and ability to buy LNG from major LNG producers and suppliers gives us the chance to capture additional value via portfolio optimization and provides incremental cash flow. Even more importantly, our access to diverse, uncorrelated markets, including New England, Brazil and Europe, generates valuable arbitrage opportunities. We are structuring our business to be able to maximize this extra value from LNG supply to gas sales agreements and power purchase agreements. Our strategy of integrating LNG supply, natural gas sales and terminal operations, gives us the ability to optimize our FSRU fleet utilization.
 •Proven Management Team. Our management team has experience in all aspects of the LNG value chain and a strong balance of technical, commercial, operational, financial, legal and management skills. Steven Kobos, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has over 25 years of experience working on complex energy and infrastructure development projects and general maritime operations, specifically LNG shipping, FSRUs, chartering of vessels, shipbuilding contracts, operational agreements and related project finance and tax matters, and he has helped establish Excelerate as a growing and profitable international energy company. Daniel Bustos, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, has over 25 years of experience leading commercial development of oil and gas projects across the globe, with a particular focus on LNG, and is responsible for the commercial development of our LNG import projects, expansion of our customer base and the buildout of our global network of regional offices. Dana Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has over 25 years of experience leading both public and private multinational companies within the energy and biotechnology industries. Ms. Armstrong provides oversight of all global financial reporting, financial planning and analysis, accounting, treasury, tax, financial systems and internal controls. David Liner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, has over 25 years of maritime experience in the oil and gas industry with specific expertise in LNG shipping as well as naval architecture, charting and project management. Alisa Newman Hood, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, has over 20 years of worldwide legal, government relations and energy policy experience. Amy Thompson, our Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, has over 20 years of human resources experience in global oil field services organizations and has held various leadership roles in the United States and the Middle East.


Competitive Landscape
 A fundamental aspect of our commercial strategy is to pursue aggressively positions in markets where we can create a foundation for lasting value creation. Although there are several developed countries that make up a significant portion of expected future global LNG demand, they are currently being served by major suppliers and provide limited growth potential for us. We place a high premium on leveraging our integrated LNG model to open new markets and partnering with LNG producers to create sustainable and profitable relationships with our customers. Our competitive landscape includes the following participants:
 •LNG-to-power developers. In many of our markets, we compete with other LNG-to-power companies, including New Fortress Energy and AES. Our investment strategy is focused on leveraging our FSRU expertise and local operational experience and relationship development to drive the expansion of incremental infrastructure projects downstream of our terminals. Our focus on the LNG-to-power value chain allows us to develop higher quality projects and enhances our ability to compete for new opportunities, as our host governments consider incremental investments to meet their growing energy demand needs.
 •Large LNG producers. When compared to major LNG producers such as Qatargas, Shell, ExxonMobil, BP and Total Energies, we believe we are better positioned to open and expand new markets given our expertise in the downstream portion of the LNG value chain. Our focus is on helping LNG producers expand the reach of their LNG supply beyond their traditional markets, resulting in less price pressure and better portfolio diversification. In close collaboration with Qatargas, we succeeded in bringing natural gas to Pakistan and Bangladesh, which triggered a dramatic displacement of coal fired plants from the government’s energy plans.
 •FSRU / LNG carrier owners. As the owner and operator of the largest FSRU fleet employed for regasification in the industry, we compete with FSRU and LNG carrier (“LNGC”) players such as New Fortress Energy, Hoegh LNG and BW Group. We distinguish ourselves by providing customers with fully integrated solutions beyond just the FSRU, giving us the ability to expand our service as their energy demands increase. This flexible approach, focused on optimizing services by swapping smaller FSRUs for larger ones, performing technical upgrades and offering seasonal service when required, fosters trust and long-term relationships with our customers. We believe the fundamentals supporting the FSRU business model require operators to focus on reliability, value and service, combined with disciplined expansion and growth.
Business Strategies
 Our primary objective is to provide superior returns to our shareholders as a vertically integrated energy company committed to addressing the lack of access to cleaner energy around the world. We intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following strategies:
 •Continue to develop our existing, diversified regasification business, supported by our large purpose-built FSRU fleet. Our current markets are essential to maintaining our solid foundation of revenues and providing new opportunities for downstream growth. Our persistent market presence helps ensure that we will be well positioned to compete for new growth opportunities as our host governments seek new investment to meet their growing energy needs. In order to continue to develop our existing, diversified regasification business, we plan to use our brand recognition and strategic commercial actions to develop a reputation as more than an FSRU provider. Maintaining a strong presence will require that our teams continue to place a high priority on operational excellence, active management of technical obsolescence, operation and maintenance improvements, and fleet optimization.
 •Pursue opportunities downstream of existing markets. With established terminals, existing markets provide opportunities for us to structure end-to-end natural gas supply products and cleaner power solutions for our customers. We expect the organic growth of our business to be accompanied by strategic acquisitions for new or existing projects, in order to enhance our growth trajectory. As we integrate new infrastructure assets downstream of our floating LNG terminals, we will be required to make investments in new products and technologies to ensure that we are positioned for success in a lower-carbon energy future. We anticipate that increasing global demand for electricity generation, more efficient access to natural gas and decarbonization initiatives will be the primary drivers of opportunity, and we intend to diversify our product portfolio responsibly and in a manner that reinforces our broader goals of improving access to cleaner and more reliable energy, creating sustainable growth and combating climate change. Our local teams will be key to expanding and diversifying our commercial, technical and financial expertise in our existing markets.
 •Utilize our global presence to enter new, growing markets. We plan to use our existing markets as a springboard into new countries and regions. Our ability to cultivate meaningful partnerships and successfully acquire equity interests in projects will be a determining factor in how quickly we are able to achieve critical mass in new markets. We are currently developing integrated LNG projects across our global footprint.
 •Create a sizable, diversified LNG procurement portfolio. Our expansion downstream will offer us the opportunity to establish valuable access to a worldwide network of natural gas markets. Our network of supply and charter contracts and 


reputation with major LNG producers provide us with ample opportunities to grow our LNG portfolio on competitive terms. This diversified portfolio will give us the opportunity to better manage the typical uncertainties of local demand (weather seasonality, economic cycles, availability of renewables, etc.), while capturing arbitrage opportunities. For example, we have already demonstrated the value of accessing the New England market in a flexible way. With the addition of new market access points in Asia, Europe and South America, we can capture value from our LNG procurement portfolio, above the margins generated in individual markets. Finally, we have always taken a very deliberate and structured approach to sourcing LNG supply. As we scale our business and gain access to new downstream natural gas markets, we believe that there are benefits from having a diversified LNG supply portfolio, including long-term supply arrangements. Building a diversified LNG supply portfolio will allow us to offer more flexible and cost-effective products to both existing and new customers in downstream markets.
 •Maintain our disciplined investment philosophy. As we grow our business, we are committed to maintaining our disciplined investment philosophy and prudent approach to project development. We have established a proven track record of investing in the right projects which has resulted in higher project returns and consistent earnings results. We also strive to negotiate the terms of our contracts in a manner that seeks to reduce potential commodity risk. It is our aim to have an industry leading portfolio of high-return growth opportunities that will support sustainable and profitable growth for years to come. We expect our contract portfolio to evolve over time to include long-term contracts as well as shorter-term agreements that will create opportunities to capture additional upside.
 Seasonality
 While most of our operations are conducted under take-or-pay arrangements, seasonal weather can affect the need for our services, particularly natural gas and LNG sales. In response, we often manage seasonal demand fluctuation in our existing markets by configuring our global operations to meet energy needs during the winters in both the northern and southern hemispheres. For example, our FSRUs have helped provide the supply security needed to keep Argentina’s economy moving and sustain the quality of life for its citizens during their winter months. Changes in temperature and weather may affect both power demand and power generation mix in the locations we serve, including the portion of electricity provided through hydroelectric plants, thus affecting the need for regasified LNG. These changes can increase or decrease demand for our services and accordingly affect our financial results.
Human Capital Resources and Social Responsibility
 Our human capital is our most valuable asset. As of December 31, 2022, we had a global headcount of 890 colleagues, consisting of 190 full-time onshore employees and 700 seafarers. The seafarers and Belgium employees are represented by labor unions or covered under collective bargaining agreements.
 We place a high premium on attracting, developing and retaining a talented and high-performing workforce. Our employees act with integrity, responsibility and compliance and are committed to upholding governance and ethics best practices. We believe this commitment is fundamental to having a sustainable business. We offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive relative to others in our industry. Our onshore employees earn a base salary plus an annual bonus (short term incentive plan) with targets aligned with organizational goals. Our seafarers earn salaries and other compensation commensurate with terms outlined in their collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
 For almost two decades, we have provided safe, efficient and cost-effective LNG solutions, and we understand that our success has been in large part due to our employees’ commitment to excellence. Our core values of stewardship, accountability, improvement and leadership (“SAIL”) represent not only our beliefs on how we conduct our business but also how we engage our employees. We have established a corporate culture with a focus on creating a collaborative environment that fosters the personal intellectual growth of each of our employees.
 Additionally, we are committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”). We encourage and welcome the exploration of all ideas, topics and perspectives that serve to enrich our team. As a U.S.-based company with global operations, we work with a diverse array of colleagues, vendors, customers, partners and local communities. The collective sum of our employees’ individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, innovation, self-expression and talent have been essential to both our operational and financial success over the years. In 2020, we launched a DEI Council with representatives from every geographic office and functional business area of our company. This council works closely with our human resources department and senior management to ensure DEI initiatives support our recruitment, engagement and retention efforts.
 We are also committed to investing in the communities in which our employees live and work. We take pride in demonstrating our appreciation for our employees by strengthening the health and prosperity of their neighborhoods. As part of our commitment, we focus on keeping people safe, supporting local talent and businesses and contributing to education and health programs, bringing benefits to the generations of today and tomorrow. Guided by our SAIL values and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, our strategic focus areas for corporate social responsibility are health, education and climate.


Health and Safety
 Health and safety are core values of Excelerate, which begin with the protection of our employees. We value people above all else and remain committed to making their safety, security and health our top priority. To protect our employees, contractors, and surrounding community from workplace hazards and risks, we implement and maintain an integrated management system of policies, practices, and controls, including requirements to complete detailed safety and regulatory compliance training on a regularly scheduled basis for all applicable individuals.
Government Regulation
 Our vessels and LNG and natural gas infrastructure are, and our operations are, subject to regulation under foreign or U.S. federal, state and local statutes, rules, regulations and laws, as well as international conventions. These regulations require, among other things, consultations with appropriate government agencies and that we obtain, maintain and comply with applicable permits, approvals and other authorizations for the conduct of our business. Governments may also periodically revise their laws or adopt new ones, and the effects of new or revised laws on our operations cannot be predicted. These regulations and laws increase our costs of operations and construction, and failure to comply with them could result in consequences such as substantial penalties or the issuance of administrative orders to cease or restrict operations until we are in compliance. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the regulations described below. For a discussion of risks related to government regulations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulations.”
Vessels
 Our vessels, whether in transit functioning as LNGCs or in port performing FSRU services, are subject to the laws of their flag states (i.e., the countries where they are registered) and the local laws of the port. These laws include international conventions promulgated by the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) to which the flag states are party. These conventions include: (i) the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention, which, among other requirements, requires us, as vessel operator, to develop an extensive safety management system that includes the adoption of health, safety, security and environmental policies and operating procedures for safety and environmental protection; (ii) the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, which is a set of measures designed to enhance the security of ships and port facilities; (iii) the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk; and (iv) the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”). In June 2015, the IMO formally adopted the International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or Low Flashpoint Fuels (the “IGF Code”), which is designed to reduce the risks involved with ships using low flashpoint fuels, including LNG. The IGF Code became mandatory under SOLAS through the adopted amendments. The IGF Code and the amendments to SOLAS became effective January 1, 2017.
 We utilize a vessel classification society, Bureau Veritas, which keeps us informed of the laws of our flag states and enforces them, through periodic inspections, which are a prerequisite to us remaining in good standing with the classification society.
 All of our vessels are registered in either Belgium or the Marshall Islands.
 Regas Terminal and FSRU Operations
 With respect to the operation of our vessels, when in port performing FSRU services, and our terminals, which terminals consist of fixed infrastructure located onshore or near shore, we are subject to the regulations of the port state. For projects in which we operate the LNG terminal, we are responsible for obtaining all operating and other permits required by the port state. Otherwise, pursuant to our charter party contracts, our customer (as terminal operator) is responsible for obtaining all permits relating to both the terminal and our FSRU. For certain of our operations where we sell or intend to sell natural gas, we are responsible for obtaining gas marketing licenses, and as we expand our natural gas sales line of business to new markets, we will be responsible for obtaining licenses in those markets.
 Environmental Regulation
 Our infrastructure and operations are subject to various laws, regulations and conventions relating to the protection of the environment, natural resources and human health. In addition to the IMO conventions mentioned above, we are also subject to the amendment to Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, which limits the sulphur content in the fuel oil used onboard ships, and the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments. These regulations require the installation of controls on emissions and structures to prevent or mitigate any potential harm to human health and the environment and require certain protocols to be in place for mitigating or responding to incidents on our vessels and at our LNG terminals.
Greenhouse Gas Regulation
 Currently, the emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”) from international shipping are not subject to the international treaty on climate change known as the Paris Agreement. However, in 2018, the IMO adopted the IMO GHG Strategy, which serves as a framework for further action with adoption of a revised IMO strategy targeted for 2023. Consistent with the IMO GHG Strategy goal of reducing

GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050, as compared to 2008 levels, the Marine Environment Protection Committee (“MEPC”) formally adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI at the 2021 MEPC session that establishes an enforceable regulatory framework to reduce GHG emissions from international shipping, consisting of technical and operational carbon reduction measures, including use of an Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (“EEXI”), an operational Carbon Intensity Indicator (“CII”) and an enhanced Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan. The amendments entered into force on November 1, 2022, requiring mandatory calculation of EEXI to measure a ship’s energy efficiency and to initiate the collection of data for the reporting of its annual operational CII and CII rating. The first annual reporting will be completed in 2023 and initial CII ratings will be given in 2024.
 Additionally, in October 2022, the European Parliament adopted a position setting standards for the proposed FuelEU Maritime regulations that would cut GHG emissions from shipping going beyond the levels set out by the European Commission. The European Parliament is negotiating the final legislation with the European Union member states and it may apply, if adopted, in January 2025. Depending on the final form of the regulations, this may impact the types of fuel used onboard Excelerate’s vessels and/or how the vessels are operated.
 Employment
 Excelerate manages our own vessel operations, including the employment of seafarers onboard the vessels that we operate. All seafarers are subject to collective bargaining agreements based on their nationality and their vessel’s flag state. In addition, seafarers are covered by the Maritime Labour Convention 2006, which is a binding international agreement setting out certain employment rights for seafarers, and corresponding obligations placed on maritime employers.
