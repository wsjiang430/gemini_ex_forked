Company Overview
 
Delcath Systems, Inc. is an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers. Our investigational product, “Melphalan Hydrochloride for Injection for use with the Delcath Hepatic Delivery System” (“Melphalan/HDS”), is designed to administer high-dose chemotherapy to the liver while controlling systemic exposure and associated side effects.  
 
1

In the United States, Melphalan/HDS is considered a combination drug and device product, is referred to by its chemical name and delivery system, Melphalan/HDS, and is regulated as a drug by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The FDA has granted us six orphan drug designations, including three orphan designations for the use of the drug melphalan for the treatment of patients with ocular melanoma liver metastases (“mOM”), hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a type of primary livery cancer (“ICC”). Melphalan/HDS has not been approved for sale in the United States. 
 
In Europe, our delivery system, without the drug, is commercially available under the trade name Delcath Hepatic CHEMOSAT® Delivery System for Melphalan (marketed under the name CHEMOSAT and referred to herein as “CHEMOSAT”), where it has been used at major medical centers to treat a wide range of cancers of the liver. The current version of CHEMOSAT is regulated as a Class IIb medical device and received its CE Mark in 2012. We are in an early phase of commercializing CHEMOSAT in select markets in the European Union (the “EU”) where the prospect of securing reimbursement coverage for the procedure is strongest. In 2015 national reimbursement coverage for CHEMOSAT procedures was awarded in Germany. In 2016, coverage levels were negotiated between hospitals in Germany and regional sickness funds. Coverage levels determined via this process are expected to be renegotiated annually. In 2017, Dutch health authorities added CHEMOSAT to their treatment guidelines for patients with ocular melanoma metastatic to the liver, an important step toward eventual reimbursement in the Dutch market.
 
Our primary research focus is on mOM and ICC and certain other cancers that are metastatic to the liver.  Currently there are few effective treatment options for certain cancers in the liver. Traditional treatment options include surgery, systemic chemotherapy, liver transplant, radiation therapy, interventional radiology techniques, and isolated hepatic perfusion. We believe that Melphalan/HDS and CHEMOSAT represent a potentially important advancement in regional therapy for primary liver cancer and certain other cancers metastatic to the liver and are uniquely positioned to treat the entire liver either as a standalone therapy or as a complement to other therapies. We believe the disease states we are investigating represent a multi-billion dollar global market opportunity and a clear unmet medical need.
 
Our clinical development program for Melphalan/HDS is comprised of the FOCUS Clinical Trial for Patients with Hepatic Dominant Ocular Melanoma (the “FOCUS Trial”), a global registration clinical trial that is investigating objective response rate in mOM, and the ALIGN Trial, a global Phase 3 clinical trial for ICC (the “ALIGN Trial”). Our product also includes a registry for CHEMOSAT commercial cases performed in Europe and sponsorship of select Investigator Initiated Trials. 
 
The direction and focus of our product is informed by prior clinical development conducted between 2004 and 2010, commercial CHEMOSAT treatment of patients in Europe, and prior regulatory experience with the FDA. Experience gained from this research and development, early European commercial cases and United States regulatory opinion has led to the implementation of several safety improvements to our product and the associated medical procedure.
 
While we currently utilize third parties to manufacture some components of our product, we also have our own medical device manufacturing operations for certain components of our product and assemble, label and package our products in Queensbury, New York.  See the discussion below under the caption “Manufacturing and Quality Assurance.” We commercialize our product in Europe through alliances with third parties.  
 
Cancers in the Liver – A Significant Unmet Need
 Cancers of the liver remain a major unmet medical need globally.  According to the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Facts & Figures 2018 report, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, with an estimated 609,640 deaths and 1.7 million new cases expected to be diagnosed in 2018. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 9.6 million deaths and 18.1 million new cases in 2018 according to GLOBOCAN, the database of the International Association of Cancer Registries. The financial burden of cancer is enormous for patients, their families and society. The Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research estimates that the direct medical costs (total of all healthcare expenditures) for cancer in the United States in 2015 was $80.2 billion. The liver is often the life-limiting organ for cancer patients and one of the leading causes of cancer death. Patient prognosis is generally poor once cancer has spread to the liver.

Liver Cancers—Incidence and Mortality
 There are two types of liver cancers: primary liver cancer and metastatic liver disease. Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC, including intrahepatic bile duct cancers or ICC) originates in the liver or biliary tissue and is particularly prevalent in populations where the primary risk factors for the disease, such as hepatitis-B, hepatitis-C, high levels of alcohol consumption, aflatoxin, cigarette smoking and exposure to industrial pollutants, are present. Metastatic liver disease, also called liver metastasis, or secondary liver cancer, is characterized by microscopic cancer cell clusters that detach from the primary site of disease and travel via the blood stream and lymphatic system into the liver, where they grow into new tumors. These metastases often continue to grow even after the primary cancer in another part of the body has been removed.  Given the vital biological functions of the liver, including processing nutrients from food and filtering toxins from the blood, it is not uncommon for metastases to settle in the liver. In many cases patients die not as a result of their primary cancer, but from the tumors that metastasize to their liver.  In the United States, metastatic liver disease is more prevalent than primary liver cancer.
 Ocular Melanoma
 Ocular melanoma is one of the cancer histologies with a high likelihood of metastasizing to the liver. Based on third party research that we commissioned in 2018, we estimate that up to 4,700 cases of ocular melanoma are diagnosed in the United States and Europe annually, and that approximately 55% of these patients will develop metastatic disease. Of metastatic cases of ocular melanoma, we estimate that approximately 90% of patients will develop liver involvement. Once ocular melanoma has spread to the liver, current evidence suggests median overall survival for these patients is generally six to eight months. Currently, there is no standard of care for patients with ocular melanoma liver metastases. Based on the research conducted in 2018, we estimate that approximately 2,000 patients with ocular melanoma liver metastases in the United States and Europe may be eligible for treatment with the Melphalan/HDS.
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
 Hepatobiliary cancers include HCC and ICC, and are among the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer. According to GLOBOCAN, an estimated 78,500 new cases of hepatobiliary cancers are diagnosed in the United States and Europe annually. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 42,030 new cases of these cancers are expected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2019, leading to approximately 31,780 deaths. 
 ICC is the second most common primary liver tumor and accounts for 3% of all gastrointestinal cancers and 15% of hepatobiliary cases diagnosed in the United States and Europe annually.  We believe that 90% of ICC patients are not candidates for surgical resection, and that approximately 20-30% of these may be candidates for certain focal interventions. According to third party research that we commissioned in 2018 we estimate that approximately 11,000 ICC patients in the United States and Europe annually could be candidates for treatment with Melphalan/HDS, which we believe represents a significant market opportunity.
 According to the American Cancer Society, the overall five-year survival rate for hepatobiliary cancers in the United States is approximately 18%. For patients diagnosed with a localized stage of disease, the American Cancer Society estimates 5-year survival at 31%. The American Cancer Society estimates that 5-year survival for all cancers is 68%. 
 About CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS
 Our product administers concentrated regional chemotherapy to the liver. This “whole organ” therapy is performed by isolating the circulatory system of the liver, infusing the liver with a chemotherapeutic agent, and then filtering the blood prior to returning it to the patient. During the procedure, known as percutaneous hepatic perfusion, PHP®, (“PHP therapy”), three catheters are placed percutaneously through standard interventional radiology techniques. The catheters temporarily isolate the liver from the body’s circulatory system, allow administration of the chemotherapeutic agent melphalan hydrochloride directly to the liver, and collect blood exiting the liver for filtration by our proprietary filters. The filters absorb chemotherapeutic agent in the blood, thereby reducing systemic exposure to the drug and related toxic side effects, before the filtered blood is returned to the patient’s circulatory system.
 PHP therapy is performed in an interventional radiology suite in approximately two to three hours. Patients remain in an intensive care or step-down unit overnight for observation following the procedure. Treatment with CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS is repeatable, and a new disposable system is used for each treatment. Patients treated in clinical settings are permitted up to six treatments. In commercial treatment settings, patients have received up to eight treatments. In the United States, melphalan hydrochloride for injection will be included as part of the product offering, if approved. In Europe, the system is sold separately and used in conjunction with melphalan hydrochloride commercially available from a third party. In our clinical trials, melphalan hydrochloride for injection is provided to both European and United States clinical trial sites.

Risks associated with CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS Procedure
 As with many cancer therapies, treatment with CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS is associated with toxic side effects and certain risks, some of which are potentially life threatening. An integrated safety population comprised of patients treated during our prior clinical development using early versions of the Melphalan/HDS showed these risks to include grade 3 or 4 bone marrow suppression and febrile neutropenia, as well as risks of hepatic injury, severe hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, stroke, and myocardial infarction in the setting of an incomplete cardiac risk assessment. Deaths due to certain adverse reactions within this integrated safety population were not observed to occur again during the clinical trials following the adoption of related protocol amendments.
 Optimization of Procedure and Improvement of Medical Device Engineering of Key Components
 The trials that comprised this integrated safety population used early versions of the device and procedure. As a consequence of these identified risks and experience gained in commercial treatment use in Europe, we have continued to develop and refine both CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS and the PHP therapy. The refinements have included modifications to the pre-, peri- and post-procedure patient management and monitoring, as well as the use of the following:  prophylactic administration of proton pump inhibitors, prophylactic platelet transfusions, prophylactic hydration at key pre-treatment intervals, use of vasopressor agents coupled with continuous monitoring for maintenance of blood pressure and prophylactic administration of growth factors to reduce risk of serious myelosuppression. In addition, in 2012 we introduced the Generation Two version of CHEMOSAT, which offered improved hemofiltration and other product enhancements.
 Reports from treating physicians in both Europe and the United States using the Generation Two CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS, respectively, in a EU commercial setting have suggested that these product improvements and procedure refinements have improved the safety profile.  In 2017, physicians in Europe and the United States also presented the results of research that signaled an improved safety profile as well as efficacy in multiple tumor types at several major medical conferences.
 Phase 3 - Melanoma Metastases Trial
 In February 2010, using an early version of our device and procedure, we concluded a randomized Phase 3 multi-center study for patients with unresectable metastatic ocular or cutaneous melanoma exclusively or predominantly in the liver. In the trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive PHP therapy with melphalan using the Melphalan/HDS, or to a control group providing “best alternative care”. Patients assigned to the PHP therapy were eligible to receive up to six cycles of treatment at approximately four to six week intervals. Patients assigned to the “best alternative care” were permitted to cross-over into the PHP therapy at radiographic documentation of hepatic disease progression. A majority of the “best alternative care” patients did in fact cross over to the PHP therapy. The primary endpoint of the study was hepatic progression-free survival while secondary objectives of the study were to determine the response rate, safety, tolerability and overall survival.
 On April 21, 2010, we announced that our randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of PHP with melphalan using Melphalan/HDS for patients with unresectable metastatic ocular and cutaneous melanoma in the liver had successfully achieved the study’s primary endpoint of extended hepatic progression-free survival (“hPFS”). An updated summary of the results was presented at the European Multidisciplinary Cancer Congress organized by the European Cancer Organization and the European Society of Medical Oncology in September 2011. Data submitted in October 2012 to the FDA in Delcath’s New Drug Application (“NDA”) comparing treatment with PHP therapy with melphalan (the “treatment group”) to “best alternative care” (the “control group”), showed that patients in the PHP therapy had a statistically significant longer median hPFS of 7.0 months compared to 1.7 months in the “best alternative care” control group, according to the Independent Review Committee assessment. This reflects a 4-fold increase of hPFS over that of the “best alternative care” therapy, with 50% reduction in the risk of progression and/or death in the PHP therapy compared to the “best alternative care” therapy. Results of this study were published in the December 2015 issue of Annals of Surgical Oncology.  
 Phase 2 - Multi-Histology, Unresectable Hepatic Tumor Trial
 Also, in 2010, we concluded a separate multi-arm Phase 2 clinical trial of PHP therapy with melphalan using an early version of the Melphalan/HDS in patients with primary and metastatic liver cancers, stratified into four arms: neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid and pancreatic islet cell tumors), ocular or cutaneous melanoma, metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma (mCRC), and HCC. In the metastatic neuroendocrine (“mNET”) cohort (n=24), the objective tumor response rate was 42%, with 66% of patients achieving hepatic tumor shrinkage and durable disease stabilization.  In the mCRC cohort, there was inconclusive efficacy possibly due to advanced disease status of the patients.  Similar safety profiles were seen across all tumor types studied in the trial.

Phase 2 - Multi-Histology Clinical Trial - HCC Cohort
 In the HCC cohort (n=8) of our Phase 2 Multi-Histology trial, a positive signal in hepatic malignancies was observed in 5 patients.  Among these patients, one patient received four treatments, achieved a partial response lasting 12.22 months, and survived 20.47 months.  Three other patients with stable disease received 3-4 treatments, with hPFS ranging 3.45 to 8.15 months, and overall survival ranging 5.26 to 19.88 months.  There was no evidence of extrahepatic disease progression.  The observed duration of hPFS and overall survival in this limited number of patients exceeded that generally associated with this patient population. 
Prior United States Regulatory Experience
 Based on the results from our prior clinical development in August 2012, we submitted an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) seeking an indication for the percutaneous intra-arterial administration of melphalan for use in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma in the liver and, subsequently, amended the indication to ocular melanoma metastatic to the liver. Data submitted to the FDA used the early clinical trial versions of the system along with early clinical procedure techniques. Our NDA was accepted for filing by the FDA on October 15, 2012 and was designated for standard review with an initial Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of June 15, 2013. On April 3, 2013, the FDA extended its PDUFA goal date to September 13, 2013.
 On May 2, 2013 we announced that an Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) panel convened by the FDA voted 16 to 0, with no abstentions, that the benefits of treatment with the early version of Melphalan/HDS did not outweigh the risks associated with the procedure. A significant portion of FDA’s presentation to the ODAC panel was focused on the FDA’s assessment of treatment related risks, including the analysis of treatment-related deaths that occurred during clinical trials. The FDA also expressed concerns about hypotension (low blood pressure) during the procedure, length of hospital stay, as well as risks of stroke, heart attack, renal failure, and bone marrow suppression. We believe that the protocol amendments and other procedure refinements instituted during clinical trials and subsequently in commercial treatment usage in Europe, including changes to the way blood pressure is managed and monitored, may help address these procedure related risks. Collection of adequate safety data on all aspects of the procedure is a major focus of the clinical trials in our current clinical development program.  Briefing materials presented to the 2013 ODAC panel by both the FDA and Delcath are available on our website at www.delcath.com/clinical-bibliography.
 2013 Complete Response Letter
 In September 2013, the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) relating to our NDA. The FDA issues a CRL after the review of an NDA has been completed and questions remain that preclude approval of the NDA in its current form. The deficiencies identified by FDA included, without limitation, a statement that Delcath must perform another “well-controlled randomized trial(s) to establish the safety and efficacy of Melphalan/HDS using overall survival as the primary efficacy outcome measure,” and which “demonstrates that the clinical benefits of Melphalan/HDS outweigh its risks.” The FDA also required that the additional clinical trial(s) be conducted using the product the Company intends to market, and that certain clinical, clinical pharmacology, human factors and product quality elements be addressed.  
 In January 2016, we announced the conclusion of a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with the FDA on the design of a new Phase 3 clinical trial of Melphalan/HDS to treat patients with hepatic dominant ocular melanoma. This SPA represented an agreement with FDA that a specific Phase 3 trial would adequately address objectives that, if met, would support the submission for regulatory approval of Melphalan/HDS. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall response rate and quality-of-life measures. However, on July 27, 2018, we announced an amendment to our Phase 3, randomized clinical trial in ocular melanoma liver metastases which, after much discussion regarding improvement of the enrollment rate with FDA, altered the trial protocol design to become a non-randomized, single-arm study with a different primary endpoint, thus invalidating the SPA agreement.
Current Clinical Development Program
 The focus of our current clinical development program is to generate clinical data for CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS in various disease states and validate the safety profile of the current version of the product and treatment procedure. We believe that the improvements we have made to CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS and to the PHP therapy have addressed the severe toxicity and procedure-related risks observed during the previous Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. The clinical development program is also designed to support clinical adoption of and reimbursement for CHEMOSAT in Europe, and to support regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions, including the United States.

The FOCUS Trial – NCT02678572
 Our amended Phase 3 trial now entitled “A Single-arm, Multi-Center, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Melphalan/HDS Treatment in Patients with Hepatic-Dominant Ocular Melanoma”, contemplates enrollment of a minimum of 80 patients with ocular melanoma metastatic to the liver. The rarity of ocular melanoma, absence of crossover to the experimental trial arm, and the availability of PHP® Therapy in a commercial setting in Europe all combined to inhibit enrollment in this trial under its previous protocol. Under the new protocol, the primary endpoint for the amended FOCUS trial will be objective response rate. Secondary endpoints will include duration of response, disease control rate, overall survival and progression-free survival. Additional exploratory outcome measures include time to objective response, hepatic progression-free survival, hepatic objective response, and quality of life, safety and other pharmacokinetic measures. Inclusion and exclusion criteria remain unchanged. Patients previously enrolled in the Melphalan/HDS arm of the trial under the previous protocol will continue to be treated and evaluated as part of the amended trial. In addition, Delcath intends to provide to the FDA interpretable comparative survival data, even if the study is underpowered to demonstrate a statistically positive overall survival effect. We believe trial enrollment will complete in the second half of 2019 and will provide evidence to support an application for approval.  
 The Phase 3 clinical trial, as amended, invalidates the prior SPA agreement for the randomized version of the trial design. Full details of the registration Phase 3 clinical trial are available at www.clinicaltrials.gov.    In December 2018, we announced that that the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) for this trial completed its fourth review of safety data for treated patients in the trial under the prior protocol. The DSMB again recommended that the study continue without modification. The trial amendment does not change safety related procedures or invalidate prior DSMB evaluations.
 The FOCUS Trial is being conducted at leading cancer centers in the United States and Europe. The Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida was activated as a participating center in January, 2016, with Jonathan Zager, M.D., FACS, Professor of Surgery in the Cutaneous Oncology and Sarcoma Departments and a Senior Member at Moffitt Cancer Center, serving as the trial's lead investigator. In October 2018, we announced continued rollout of the amended protocol to participating centers in the United States and are working with approximately 30 leading cancer centers in the United States and Europe to participate in the trial.
 Melphalan hydrochloride has been granted orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of patients with ocular melanoma. Based on the strength of the efficacy data in this disease observed in our prior Phase 3 clinical trial and the reports of an improved safety profile observed in treatment experience in Europe, we are confident that this program can address the concerns raised by the FDA in its CRL. 
 The ALIGN Trial- NCT03086993
 In April 2018, we announced the initiation of a new pivotal trial of Melphalan/HDS to treat patients with ICC titled “A Randomized, Controlled Study to Compare the Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Melphalan/HDS Treatment Given Sequentially Following Cisplatin/Gemcitabine versus Cisplatin/Gemcitabine (Standard of Care) in Patients with Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma” (the “ALIGN Trial”).   The ALIGN Trial is being conducted under an SPA announced in March 2017.  Under the terms of the SPA, the ALIGN Trial will enroll approximately 295 ICC patients at approximately 40 clinical sites in the United States and Europe.  The primary endpoint is overall survival and secondary and exploratory endpoints include safety, progression-free survival, overall response rate and quality-of-life measures. The SPA agreement for the ALIGN Trial indicates that the pivotal trial design adequately addresses objectives that, if met, would support regulatory requirements for approval of Melphalan/HDS in ICC.  However, final determinations for marketing application approval are made by FDA after a complete review of a marketing application and are based on the totality of data in the application.
 In October 2018, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the ALIGN Trial at The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Methodist University Hospital, and West Cancer Center in Memphis, Tennessee.

Phase 2 Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) & Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) Program
 In 2014, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial program in Europe and the United States, with the goal of obtaining an efficacy and safety signal for Melphalan/HDS in the treatment of HCC and ICC. Due to differences in treatment practice patterns between Europe and the United States, we established separate European and United States trial protocols for the HCC Phase 2 program with different inclusion and exclusion patient selection criteria:
 Protocol 201 NCT02406508 – Conducted in the United States, this trial was intended to assess the safety and efficacy of Melphalan/HDS followed by sorafenib.  This trial was terminated earlier than planned and is now closed to enrollment.
 Protocol 202 NCT02415036 – Conducted in Europe, this trial was intended to assess the safety and efficacy of Melphalan/HDS without sorafenib. The trial will also evaluate overall response rate via mRECIST criteria, progression free survival, characterize the systemic exposure of melphalan and assess patient quality of life.  This trial was terminated earlier than planned and is now closed to enrollment.
 ICC Cohort – In 2015 we expanded Protocol 202 to include a cohort of patients with ICC. The trial for this cohort was conducted at the same centers participating in the Phase 2 HCC trial. This trial has completed enrollment and data from this study are being analyzed and will be disseminated publicly by the investigators. 
 ICC Retrospective Data Collection - The original goal to obtain an efficacy signal for the Phase 2 ICC cohort has been satisfied by the result of multicenter patient outcomes identified in the retrospective data collection of our commercial ICC cases conducted by our European investigators. These promising outcomes and observations were discussed with Key Opinion Leaders at a Delcath-organized medical advisory panel meeting and led to the agreement that PHP therapy does “demonstrate an efficacy signal in ICC and is worthy of full clinical investigation.” Data from this retrospective data collection provided important scientific support during our negotiations with the FDA for our SPA for the Pivotal ICC Trial. Data for the retrospective data collection were published in European Radiology in a paper entitled “Percutaneous Hepatic Perfusion (Chemosaturation) with Melphalan in Patients with Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma: European Multicentre Study on Safety, Short Term Effects and Survival”. Details of the findings from this study are discussed below under “Recent Data Presentations”. 
 With the objectives of identifying an efficacy signal worthy of further clinical investigation now met, we have terminated enrollment in our Phase 2 program and have closed the Phase 2 trials in order to focus available resources on the FOCUS Trial and the ALIGN Trial.
 Clinical trials are long in duration, expensive and highly uncertain processes and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage of clinical development. The start or end of a clinical trial is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements, manufacturing challenges, required clinical trial administrative actions, slower than anticipated patient enrollment, changing standards of care, availability or prevalence of use of a comparator treatment or required prior therapy. A substantial portion of the Company’s operating expenses consist of research and development expenses incurred in connection with its clinical trials. See the Company’s consolidated financial statements provided under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 European Investigator Initiated Trials
 In addition to the clinical trials in our clinical development program, we are supporting data generation in other areas. We are currently conducting one Investigator Initiated Trial in colorectal carcinoma metastatic to the liver (“mCRC”) at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands. We continue to evaluate other Investigatory Initiated Trials as suitable opportunities present themselves in Europe. We believe Investigatory Initiated Trials will serve to build clinical experience at key cancer centers and will help support efforts to obtain full reimbursement in Europe.
European Clinical Data Generation
 On April 2, 2015, we announced the activation of our prospective patient registry in Europe to collect uniform essential patient safety, efficacy, and Quality of Life information using observational study methods. This registry will gather data in multiple tumor types from commercial cases performed by participating cancer centers in Europe.  A prospective registry is an organized system that uses observational study methods to collect defined clinical data under normal conditions of use to evaluate specified outcomes for a population defined by a particular disease, condition, or exposure.  Registry data are non-randomized, and as such cannot be used for approval or promotional claims.  However, we believe the patient registry will provide a valuable supportive data repository from a commercial setting that can be used to identify further clinical development opportunities, support clinical adoption and reimbursement in Europe.

Recent Data Presentations
 In April 2019 we announced that results from a prospective Phase 2 study conducted by Leiden University Medical Center (“LUMC”) in the Netherlands on the use of CHEMOSAT to treat patients with metastatic ocular melanoma with liver metastases were presented at the European Conference on Interventional Oncology annual meeting.
 The LUMC study entitled “Percutaneous hepatic perfusion with melphalan in patients with unresectable liver metastases from ocular melanoma using the Delcath System's second-generation hemofiltration system: a prospective phase II study” was conducted by a team led and presented by Dr. Mark Burgmans. The study evaluated 35 patients with unresectable liver metastases from ocular melanoma treated with CHEMOSAT between February 2014 and June 2017. The 35 patients underwent a total of 72 PHP therapy treatments, and tumor response was evaluable in 32 patients. Primary endpoints were overall response, overall survival, and progression free survival. Secondary measures included safety measures and hematologic toxicity.
 Results of the study showed that one patient had a complete response and 22 had partial response, for a combined overall response rate of 74.1%. Overall survival was 20.3 months and mean progression free survival was 8.1 months.
 Safety analysis showed a total of 14 serious adverse events were recorded. The hematologic toxicities were in a majority of the cases self-limiting and manageable. Investigators concluded that “PHP Therapy with the Generation Two version of CHEMOSAT is an effective and safe treatment for patients with hepatic metastases from ocular melanoma.”
 The presentation at the European Conference, an Interventional Oncology updated data previously presented at the 2018 annual conference of the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe.
 In October 2018, we announced that results of a multicenter retrospective analysis of outcomes in patients with ICC treated with CHEMOSAT were published in the journal European Radiology. The study is the first analysis on the use of Delcath’s PHP therapy for the treatment of ICC. The retrospective analysis, “Percutaneous Hepatic Perfusion (Chemosaturation) with Melphalan in Patients with Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma: European Multicentre Study on Safety, Short Term Effects and Survival” was conducted by investigators in Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and France with Dr. Steffen Marquardt of Hannover Medical School serving as lead author. The study evaluated 15 patients with ICC who were selected for PHP therapy after failing prior therapies. The patients were treated at nine hospitals throughout Europe between 2012 and 2016. Treatment outcomes were assessed by imaging every three months following PHP treatment.
 After the first PHP therapy treatment, one patient (7%) had a complete response (“CR”), two patients (13%) had a partial response (“PR”), and stable disease (“SD”) was observed in eight patients (53%). This equates to a control rate (CR+PR+SD) of 73%. The complete response patient was not retreated and is still alive. Three patients (20%) progressed after the first treatment and one patient died prior to post-procedure imaging. Five of the patients with SD received a second PHP therapy treatment, resulting in one PR (20%), three SD (60%), and one PD (20%). During the follow-up phase, two of the SD patients received additional PHP therapy treatments. Median overall survival was 26.9 months from initial diagnosis and 7.6 months from first PHP treatment. One-year overall survival from first PHP was 40%. Median progression free survival (“PFS”) was 122 days, and median hepatic progression free survival (“hPFS”) was 131 days.
 In their retrospective data collection, investigators stated that side-effects were potentially under-reported but were considered by the investigators to be tolerable and comparable to other systemic and local therapies.  Nevertheless, in the context of the patient selection, baseline characteristics and number of PHP therapy treatments provided in this retrospective study, practitioners observed no adverse events of grades 3 or 4 severity during the PHP therapy treatment. Post-procedurally, significant hematological toxicity was observed in the form of anemia and thrombocytopenia 5-7 days after the PHP therapy treatment.  Management with Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor was employed in some patients.  These toxicities were considered consistent with those toxicities reported in the ABC 02 trial of systemic chemotherapy in this patient population. The ABC-02 trial was a randomized, controlled, phase 3 trial that was designed and developed by the ABC-02 Trial Management Group under the auspices of the Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Clinical Studies Group of the United Kingdom National Cancer Research Institute. The study was conducted by investigators at 37 centers in the United Kingdom, and data were collected and analyzed at the Cancer Research United Kingdom and University College London Cancer Trials Centre, London.  In this trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin plus gemcitabine or gemcitabine alone for up to 24 weeks.
 Investigators concluded that PHP therapy provides “promising response rates in patients with ICC,” and that side-effects were tolerable and comparable to other treatment strategies.

The study entitled “Survival and Response of Patients with Metastatic Ocular Melanoma after Chemosaturation Percutaneous Hepatic Perfusion” was conducted by M. Zeile, and A. Stang, et al of the Asklepios Barmbek Clinic in Hamburg, Germany. The study retrospectively evaluated response rates and overall survival in 12 patients with ocular melanoma liver metastases after treatment with Delcath’s PHP therapy. Five patients had metastases confined to the liver, and seven had additional extra-hepatic metastases. A total of 30 PHP therapy treatments were performed in the sample, and patients received an average of 2.5 treatments.
 The objective response rate was 58.3%, and the disease control rate was 91.7% (1 complete response, 6 partial responses, 4 stable disease, and 1 progressive disease). Following the first PHP therapy treatment, progression free survival was 11.7 months and hPFS was 18.6 months. Median overall survival was 30.6 months following the treatment. Of the cohort of 12 patients, three patients were judged to be candidates for surgery following treatment with PHP therapy. Median overall survival among these patients was 76.8 months, though investigators cautioned that statistical conclusions cannot be drawn from the small sample size.
 In May 2018, we announced that PHP therapy was featured in a Video Learning Session presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Conference of Interventional Oncology (“ECIO”). Dr. M.C. Burgmans of LUMC presented an overview of the PHP therapy, discussed the therapy’s developmental history, demonstrating how to perform the procedure, as well as outlining its potential in ocular melanoma liver metastases and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and highlighting ongoing clinical research.  In his presentation, Dr. Burgmans stated his belief that PHP therapy should be considered as first line therapy in ocular melanoma liver metastases, an opinion informed by both our commercial experience in Europe and our prior research into this tumor type.  LUMC is an experienced treatment center and has recently completed its 100th treatment using CHEMOSAT.  We believe Dr. Burgmans’ comments reflect growing confidence in PHP therapy’s role in treating ocular melanoma liver metastases. 
 In January 2018, we announced the publication of a multi-center retrospective analysis of Delcath’s PHP therapy published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Surgical Oncology. The study entitled “Percutaneous Hepatic Perfusion with Melphalan in Uveal Melanoma: A Safe and Effective Treatment Modality in an Orphan Disease”, was conducted by researchers from Moffitt Cancer Center (Moffitt) in Tampa, Florida and the University Hospital Southampton (UHS) in the United Kingdom. The retrospective analysis of outcomes in 51 patients with liver metastases from ocular melanoma represents the largest data set compilation on the use of PHP therapy in this tumor type outside of a clinical trial setting.
 Patients in the study were treated at the two centers between December 2008 and October 2016. Patients received up to four PHP therapy treatments at UHS and up to six PHP therapy treatments at Moffitt. All patients received at least one PHP therapy treatment, the median number of treatments per patient was two, and a total of 134 PHP therapy treatments were administered. Results showed that of the 51 treated patients, 22 (43.1%) showed a partial response, 3 (5.9%) showed a complete response, and 17 (33.3%) had stable disease. The six-month overall and hepatic disease control rates were 64.7% and 70.6% respectively. Survival analysis showed median overall survival of 15.3 months at the time of data cut off. One year overall survival was 64.6%.
 Safety analysis showed that 19 patients (37.5%) had Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity. Cardiovascular toxicity was seen in 17.6% of patients, a rate comparable to the company’s prior Phase 3 study. Further to implementation of the Gen 2 filter along with prophylactic use of growth factors, severe neutropenia was seen in 16 (31.3%) patients as opposed to 60 (85.7%) patients in the prior Phase 3 trial. Most significantly, as compared to the prior Phase 3 trial, there were no treatment related deaths. Researchers stated that PHP therapy “can be safely employed in appropriately selected ocular melanoma patients in institutions with appropriate expertise.”
 The study authors further concluded that “results clearly demonstrate that PHP therapy appears to be an effective means of obtaining rapid intrahepatic disease control and is a sensible option in patients with predominant liver disease.” Researchers reported that their results support the use of PHP therapy in an integrated approach to the management of metastatic ocular melanoma and looked to the Company’s Phase 3 FOCUS Trial to further quantify the benefit and optimize treatment strategies for these patients.
 Market Access and Commercial Clinical Adoption
 Europe
 Delcath’s marketing strategy in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) includes establishing strategic alliances with partners that include license, supply, sales and marketing arrangements.
 In December 2018, Delcath entered into a definitive licensing agreement (the “medac License”) for CHEMOSAT commercialization in Europe with medac Gesellschaft für klinische Spezialpräparate mbH (“medac”), a privately held, multi-national pharmaceutical company based in Wedel, Germany. Founded in 1970, medac specializes in the treatment and diagnosis of oncological, urological and autoimmune diseases. medac has offices globally, worldwide partner agreements in over 90 countries, and approximately 1,200 employees.
 9

Under the terms of the medac License, Delcath’s European subsidiary, Delcath Systems, Ltd., exclusively licenses to medac the right to sell and market CHEMOSAT in all member states of the European Union, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The medac License provides for payment by medac to Delcath in a combination of upfront and success-based milestone payments as well as a fixed transfer price per unit of CHEMOSAT and specified royalties. We believe that medac is a well-suited partner to help advance CHEMOSAT commercialization in the European Union and neighboring countries. medac has offices throughout Europe, a well-established network among oncology key opinion leaders, and organizational scale necessary to help establish CHEMOSAT in the European treatment landscape for cancers of the liver. 
 Since launching CHEMOSAT in Europe, over 600 commercial treatments have been performed at over 25 leading European cancer centers. Physicians in Europe have used CHEMOSAT to treat patients with a variety of cancers in the liver, primarily ocular melanoma liver metastases, and other tumor types, including cutaneous melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and liver metastases from colorectal cancer, breast, pancreatic and neuroendocrine.  Patients treated in Europe have received up to eight CHEMOSAT treatments, and the average number of repeat treatments performed on a per patient basis has consistently increased. In 2018, Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands surpassed 100 treatments with CHEMOSAT since initiating procedures, the third European center to achieve the milestone.
 In March 2018, we announced that we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Tillomed Laboratories, an EMCURE company, for the procurement of melphalan for use with CHEMOSAT in Europe. Tillomed Laboratories specializes in the licensing, marketing and supply of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to hospitals, wholesalers and pharmacists nationwide, in a cost-effective and timely manner. We believe this agreement establishes firm control over our melphalan supply chain in Europe, and over time will provide economies of scale.  The supply agreement with Tillomed also gives Delcath access to the drug dossier for melphalan hydrochloride, an important asset that potentially provides a drug approval pathway with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in Europe.  As many of the cancers of the liver we are treating with CHEMOSAT are orphan indications in the United States, a Marketing Authorization Application approval by the EMA for CHEMOSAT could potentially provide added market protection for these indications in Europe.
 European Reimbursement
 A critical driver of utilization growth for CHEMOSAT in Europe is the expansion of reimbursement mechanisms for the procedure in our priority markets. In Europe, there is no centralized pan-European medical device reimbursement body. Reimbursement is administered on a regional and national basis. Medical devices are typically reimbursed under Diagnosis Related Groups (“DRG”) as part of a procedure. Prior to obtaining permanent DRG reimbursement codes, in certain jurisdictions, we are actively seeking interim reimbursement from existing mechanisms that include specific interim reimbursement schemes, new technology payment programs as well as existing DRG codes. In most EU countries, the government provides healthcare and controls reimbursement levels. Since the EU has no jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states, the methodologies for determining reimbursement rates and the actual rates may vary by country. 
 Effective with the execution of our license agreement with medac, medac will provide support for reimbursement applications in the European markets covered by our agreement.
 Germany
 In October 2015, we announced that the Institut fϋr das Entgeltsystem im Krankenhaus (“InEk”), the German federal reimbursement agency, established a national Zusatzentgeld (“ZE”) reimbursement code for procedures performed with CHEMOSAT in Germany. The ZE diagnostic-related group code is a national reimbursement code that augments existing DRG codes until a specific new DRG code can be created, and will replace the previous Neue Untersuchungs und Behandlungsmethoden (“NUB”) procedure that required patients in Germany to apply individually for reimbursement of their CHEMOSAT treatment.  With the establishment of a ZE code for CHEMOSAT, the procedure is now permanently represented in the DRG catalog in Germany. Coverage levels under this process are negotiated between hospitals in Germany and regional sickness funds, with coverage levels renegotiated annually.   
United Kingdom
 In May 2014, National Institute for Health and Care Clinical Excellence (“NICE”), a non-departmental public body that provides guidance and advice to improve health and social care in the UK, completed a clinical review of CHEMOSAT. The NICE review indicated that as the current body of evidence on the safety and efficacy of PHP therapy with CHEMOSAT for primary or metastatic liver cancer is limited, the procedure should be performed within the context of research by clinicians with specific training in its use and techniques. 
 10

Medac will continue consultations begun by Delcath with the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee at NICE in England, providing recent clinical evidence with a view to moving existing Interventional Procedural Guidance from a research recommendation to specialist recommendation. This would enable greater scope for commercialization access to the therapy because it would allow more use by National Health Service (“NHS”) clinicians of the therapy. It might also pave the way for a full Medical Technology Assessment as a way towards longer term reimbursement within the NHS.  
 In the short term, public patients will continue to be treated in the UK through clinical trials. Private patients will continue to be treated through the established private treatment pathway such as private insurance coverage or self-pay.
 Netherlands
 In the Netherlands CHEMOSAT has been performed at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in 2013 and at Leiden University Medical Centre since 2014. In June 2017, the Medical Oncology National Treatment Guidelines for Uveal Melanoma were updated and now include recommendations to consider CHEMOSAT in the treatment of liver metastases. We are hopeful that inclusion in the national guidelines and the support of clinicians treating patients with CHEMOSAT will eventually support an application for reimbursement in this market.
Spain
 In Spain, the Company has determined that there was no benefit to continuing with its relationship with a local sales agency. The Spanish market will now be served by medac.  
Turkey
 In April 2016, we announced the activation of the Hacettepe University Clinic in Ankara, Turkey as a CHEMOSAT treatment center. Hacettepe University Clinic successfully completed its first CHEMOSAT treatments in March 2016, and the center represents the first CHEMOSAT commercial location to be activated outside of the European Union. In 2018, a second center has been activated in Turkey. We believe that these centers can serve as important location for CHEMOSAT treatment to patients in Turkey and throughout the region. The Company is represented in Turkey through a distribution partner.
Regulatory Status
 Our products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and the FDA. Foreign regulatory agencies, the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions impose extensive requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market clearance and approval, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, advertising and promotion, pricing, storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical device products. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory agency or FDA requirements may result in Warning Letters, fines, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market.
United States Regulatory Environment
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and device products under the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Melphalan/HDS is subject to regulation as a combination product, which means it is composed of both a drug product and a device product. If marketed individually, each component would therefore be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its pre-market review and regulation based on a determination of its primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of the Melphalan/HDS, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, has primary jurisdiction over its pre-market development and review.
 The process required by the FDA before drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 11

 
• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced and tested to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular product candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information. Similar requirements to the United States IND are required in the European Economic Area and other jurisdictions in which we may conduct clinical trials.
 Clinical Trials
 For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap: 
  
• | Phase 1 Clinical Trials. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, typically in healthy humans, but in some cases in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 Clinical Trials. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 Clinical Trials. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 Clinical Trials. The FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved an NDA. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12

Sponsors of clinical trials may submit proposals for the design, execution, and analysis for their pivotal trials under an SPA. An SPA is an evaluation by the FDA of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement that the Phase 3 trial protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the drug product candidate with respect to effectiveness for the indication studied. Under an SPA, the FDA agrees to not later alter its position with respect to adequacy of the design, execution or analyses of the clinical trial intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim in an NDA, without the sponsor’s agreement, unless the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug after testing begins.
 New Drug Applications
 The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs also must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing and control information. An NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, which may be waived in certain circumstances. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. For new oncology products, the FDA will often solicit an opinion from an ODAC, a panel of expert authorities knowledgeable in the fields of general oncology, pediatric oncology, hematologic oncology, immunologic oncology, biostatistics, and other related professions. The ODAC panel reviews and evaluates data concerning the safety and effectiveness of marketed and investigational human drug products for use in the treatment of cancer, and makes recommendations to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. The FDA will deny approval of an NDA by issuing a Complete Response Letter (CRL) if the applicable statutory criteria are not satisfied. A CRL may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Approval may be contingent on a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy that limits the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information.
 There are three primary regulatory pathways for a New Drug Application under Section 505 of the FDCA: Section 505(b)(1), Section 505(b)(2) and Section 505(j).  A Section 505(b)(1) application is used for approval of a new drug (for clinical use) whose active ingredients have not been previously approved. A Section 505(b)(2) application is used for a new drug that relies on data not developed by the applicant. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. This statutory provision permits the approval of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits the applicant to rely in part upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for previously approved products. A Section 505(j) application, also known as an abbreviated NDA, is used for a generic version of a drug that has already been approved.
 Orphan Drug Exclusivity
 Some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. The orphan designation is granted for a combination of a drug entity and an indication and therefore it can be granted for an existing drug with a new (orphan) indication. Applications are made to the Office of Orphan Products Development at the FDA and a decision or request for more information is usually rendered in about 60 days. NDAs for designated orphan drugs are exempt from user fees, obtain additional clinical protocol assistance, are eligible for tax credits up to 50% of research and development costs, and are granted a seven-year period of exclusivity upon approval. Exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA for the designated orphan drug and prevents FDA from approving the same drug for the same condition during this period of exclusivity, except in certain circumstances such as where the subsequent applicant can demonstrate clinical superiority to the originally approved orphan drug. However, orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving the same drug for a different indication, or different drugs for the same indication.
 13

The FDA has granted Delcath six orphan drug designations. In November 2008, the FDA granted Delcath two orphan drug designations for the drug melphalan for the treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma as well as patients with ocular melanoma. In May 2009, the FDA granted Delcath an additional orphan drug designation of the drug melphalan for the treatment of patients with neuroendocrine tumors. In August 2009, the FDA granted Delcath an orphan drug designation of the drug doxorubicin for the treatment of patients with primary liver cancer. In October 2013, the FDA granted Delcath an orphan drug designation of the drug melphalan for the treatment of HCC. In July 2015, the FDA granted Delcath an orphan drug designation of the drug melphalan for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma, which includes ICC.
 The granting of orphan drug designations does not mean that the FDA has approved a new drug. Companies must still pursue the rigorous development and approval process that requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product will be granted at all or on a timely basis.
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form 483 and Untitled Letters or Warning Letters that could cause us or our third-party manufacturers to modify certain activities. A Form 483 Notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidelines. In addition to Form 483 Notices and Untitled Letters or Warning Letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action recalls of products from the market, withdrawal of any potential approvals of a product, or civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, Warning Letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
 Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, in particular in oncology. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
 European Regulatory Environment
 In the EEA, CHEMOSAT is subject to regulation as a medical device. The EEA is composed of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Under the EU Medical Devices Directive (Directive No 93/42/ECC of 14 June 1993, as last amended), drug delivery products such as the CHEMOSAT system is governed by the EU laws on pharmaceutical products only if they are (i) placed on the market in such a way that the device and the pharmaceutical product form a single integral unit which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination, and (ii) the product is not reusable. In such cases, the drug delivery product is governed by the EU Code on Medicinal Products for Human Use (Directive 2001/83/EC, as last amended), while the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive apply to the safety and performance-related device features of the product. Because we do not intend to place CHEMOSAT on the EEA market as a single integral unit with melphalan, the product is governed solely by the EU Medical Devices Directive, while the separately marketed drug is governed by the EU Code relating to Medicinal Products for Human Use and other EU legislation applicable to drugs for human use. 
 14

Before we may commercialize a medical device in the EEA, we must comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements entitles a manufacturer to affix a CE conformity mark, without which the products cannot be commercialized in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE conformity mark, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. In April 2011, we obtained authorization to affix a CE Mark for the Generation One CHEMOSAT system and began European commercialization with this version of the CHEMOSAT system in early 2012. In April 2012, the Company obtained authorization to affix a CE Mark for the Generation Two version of CHEMOSAT, and since this time all procedures in Europe have been performed with this version of the system.
 The Medical Devices Directive establishes a classification system placing devices into Class I, IIa, IIb, or III, depending on the risks and characteristics of the medical device. For certain types of low risk medical devices (i.e., Class I devices which are non-sterile and do not have a measuring function), the manufacturer may issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directives. Other devices are subject to a conformity assessment procedure requiring the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments.
 CHEMOSAT is regulated as a Class IIb medical device. As a Class IIb medical device, the Notified Body is not required to carry out an examination of the product’s design dossier as part of its conformity assessment prior to commercialization. The Company must continue to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive (Directive 93/42 EC) and is subject to a conformity assessment procedure requiring the intervention of a Notified Body.  The conformity assessment procedure for Class IIb medical devices requires the manufacturer to apply for the assessment of its quality system for the design, manufacture and inspection of its medical devices by a Notified Body.  The Notified Body will audit the system to determine whether it conforms to the provisions of the Medical Devices Directive.  If the Notified Body’s assessment is favorable it will issue a Full Quality Assurance Certificate, which enables the manufacturer to draw a Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark to the medical devices covered by the assessment. Thereafter, the Notified Body will carry out periodic audits to ensure that the approved quality system is applied by the manufacturer.
 A manufacturer without a registered place of business in a Member State of the EU which places a medical device on the market under its own name must designate an Authorized Representative established in the European Union who can act before, and be addressed by, the Competent Authorities on the manufacturer’s behalf with regard to the manufacturer’s obligations under the EU Medical Devices Directive. We appointed such a representative prior to establishing our infrastructure in the EEA.  With the Delcath Systems Ltd. infrastructure now firmly in place, the Authorized Representative responsibilities have been formally transferred internally and there is no longer a need for a third party representative.
 In the EEA, we must also comply with the Medical Device Vigilance System, which is designed to improve the protection of health and safety of patients, users and others by reducing the likelihood of recurrence of incidents related to the use of a medical device. Under this system, incidents are defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient, or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. When a medical device is suspected to be a contributory cause of an incident, its manufacturer or authorized representative in the EU must report it to the Competent Authority of the Member State where the incident occurred. Incidents are generally investigated by the manufacturer. The manufacturer’s investigation is monitored by the Competent Authority, which may intervene, or initiate an independent investigation if considered appropriate. An investigation may conclude in the adoption of a Field Safety Corrective Action (“FSCA”). An FSCA is an action taken by a manufacturer to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An FSCA may include device recall, modification exchange and destruction. FSCAs must be notified by the manufacturer or its authorized representative to its customers and/or the end users of the medical device via a Field Safety Notice.
 In the EEA, the off-label promotion of a pharmaceutical product is strictly prohibited under the EU Community Code on Medicinal Products, which provides that all information provided within the context of the promotion of a drug must comply with the information contained in its approved summary of product characteristics. Our product instructions and indication reference the chemotherapeutic agent melphalan hydrochloride. However, no melphalan labels in the EEA reference our product, and the labels vary from country to country with respect to the approved indication of the drug and its mode of administration. In the exercise of their professional judgment in the practice of medicine, physicians are generally allowed, under certain conditions, to use or prescribe a product in ways not approved by regulatory authorities. Physicians intending to use our device must obtain melphalan separately for use with the CHEMOSAT system and must use melphalan independently at their discretion.
 15

In the EEA, the advertising and promotion of our products is also subject to EEA Member States laws implementing the EU Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals.
 Failure to comply with the EEA Member State laws implementing the Medical Devices Directive, with the EU and EEA Member State laws on the promotion of medicinal products or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the EEA Member State authorities, which may include any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall.
 The European Commission recently reviewed the Medical Device Directive legislative framework and promulgated Regulation (the “EU”) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on Medical Devices, Amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (“EC”) No 1223/2009 and repealing Council Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC.  This new Medical Device Regulation became effective on May 25, 2017, marking the start of a 3-year transition period for manufacturers selling medical device in Europe to comply with the new medical device regulation which governs all facets of medical devices.  The transition task is highly complex and touches every aspect of product development, manufacturing production, distribution and post marketing evaluation.
 Effectively addressing these changes will require a complete review of our device operations to determine what is necessary to comply.  We do not believe the medical device regulatory changes will impact our business at this time, though implementation of the medical device legislation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations or restrict our operations.
 Other International Regulations
 CHEMOSAT has received registrations in the following countries: Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Taiwan, and Singapore. With limited resources and our attention focused on European commercial and clinical adoption efforts, pursuing other markets at this time is not practical. We will continue to evaluate commercial opportunities in these and other markets when resources are available and at an appropriate time.

 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and trademarks, maintain trade secret and know-how protection, enforce our proprietary rights against infringers, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. Because of the length of time and expense associated with developing new products and bringing them through the regulatory approval process, the health care industry places considerable emphasis on obtaining patent protection and maintaining trade secret protection for new technologies, products, processes, know-how, and methods. The Company currently holds rights in six United States utility patents, one United States design patent, three pending United States utility patent applications, four issued foreign counterpart utility patents (including a European patent directed to our filter apparatus that has been validated in eight European countries and a European patent directed to our filter media apparatus), six issued foreign counterpart design patents, and two
 pending foreign counterpart patent applications. In October 2018 and February 2019 patents directed to our chemotherapy filtration system and a method of using our filter and frame apparatus were issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. A Notice of Allowance was obtained from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the patent application entitled “Apparatus For Removing Chemotherapy Compounds from Blood” with allowed claims to a kit of parts capable of being assembled for delivering a small molecule chemotherapeutic agent to a subject. The allowed claims are directed to CHEMOSAT. A Hong Kong patent directed to our Filter and Frame Apparatus was issued in March of 2018. A European patent was granted for our chemotherapy filtration system in November 2018 and a European patent application directed to a method of using our filter and frame apparatus was granted in April 2019 by the European Patent Office. 
 When appropriate, the Company actively pursues protection of our proprietary products, technologies, processes, and methods by filing United States and international patent and trademark applications. We seek to pursue additional patent protection for technology invented through research and development, manufacturing, and clinical use of CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS that will enable us to expand our patent portfolio around advances to our current systems, technology, and methods for our current applications as well as beyond the treatment of cancers in the liver.
 There can be no assurance that the pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with a competitive advantage.

To maintain our proprietary position, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary technological experience to protect proprietary manufacturing processes, technology, and know-how relating to our business.  We rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our marketing partners, employees, advisors, vendors and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. In addition, we also seek to maintain our trade secrets through maintenance of the physical security of the premises where our trade secrets are located.  There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.
 In certain circumstances, United States patent law allows for the extension of a patent’s duration for a period of up to five years after FDA approval.  The Company intends to seek extension for one of our patents after FDA approval if it has not expired prior to the date of approval. In addition to our proprietary protections, the FDA has granted Delcath five orphan drug designations that provide us a seven-year period of exclusive marketing beginning on the date that our NDA is approved by the FDA for the designated orphan drug. While the exclusivity only applies to the indication for which the drug has been approved, the Company believes that it will provide us with added protection once commercialization of an orphan drug designated product begins.
 There has been and continues to be substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and medical device areas. If a third party asserts a claim against Delcath, the Company may be forced to expend significant time and money defending such actions and an adverse determination in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to redesign our product, require us to seek licenses from third parties, and, if licenses are not available, prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our system. Additionally, Delcath plans to enforce its intellectual property rights vigorously and may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights or to protect our trade secrets or know-how. Patent litigation can be costl
y and time consuming and there can be no assurance that the outcome will be favorable to us.

Competition
 The healthcare industry is characterized by extensive research, rapid technological progress and significant competition from numerous healthcare companies and academic institutions. Competition in the cancer treatment industry is intense. We believe that the primary competitive factors for products addressing cancer include safety, efficacy, ease of use, reliability and price. We also believe that physician relationships, especially relationships with leaders in the medical and surgical oncology communities, are important competitive factors. We also believe that the current global economic conditions and new healthcare reforms could put competitive pressure on us, including reduced selling prices and potential reimbursement rates, and overall procedure rat
es. Certain markets in Europe are experiencing the effects of continued economic weakness, which is affecting healthcare budgets and reimbursement. 
 CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS compete with all forms of liver cancer treatments, including surgery, systemic chemotherapy, focal therapies and palliative care. In the disease states we are targeting there are also numerous clinical trials sponsored by third-parties, which can compete for potential patients in the near term and may ultimately lead to new competitiv
e therapies. 
 For ocular melanoma liver metastases, there are currently no approved or effective treatment options, and patients are generally treated with a variety of focal and regional techniques. There are numerous companies developing and marketing de
vices for the performance of focal therapies, including Covidian, Biocompatibles, Merit, CeleNova, SirTex, AngioDynamics, and many others. 
 For ICC, gemcitabine plus cisplatin remains the standard of care for the treatment of ICC in patients who are not candidates for surgery.

Several therapies have been recently approved for unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, which may encompass liver metastases.  Dabrafenib (Tafinlar™, GlaxoSmithKline), is indicated as single agent for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation, and in combination with trametinib in unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.  Furthermore, trametinib (MEKINIST™, GlaxoSmithKline) is indicated as single agent (in addition to in combination with dabrafinib) for treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. Previously approved melanoma therapies such as the biologic ipilimumab (Yervoy™, Bristol Myers Squibb) and the B-RAF targeted drug vemurafenib (Zelboraf™, Genentech) may also make up the competitive landscape for the treatment of metastatic liver disease. Many of these treatments are approved in Europe and other global markets.
 Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing and personnel resources. In addition, some of our competitors have considerable experience in conducting clinical trials, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities. Our competitors may develop alternative treatment methods, or achieve earlier product development, in which case the likelihood of us achieving meaningful revenues or profitability will be substantially reduced.
 Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 We manufacture certain components of our product, including our proprietary filter media, and assemble and package CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS at our facility in Queensbury, New York. We have established our European headquarters and packaging/labeling/distribution facility in Galway, Ireland where we intend to conduct final manufacturing and assembly in the future. We currently utilizes third-parties to manufacture some components of CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS. CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS and their components must be manufactured and sterilized in accordance with approved manufacturing and pre-determined performance specifications. In addition, certain components will require sterilization prior to distribution and Delcath relies on third-party vendo
rs to perform the sterilization process. 
 We are committed to providing high quality products to our customers. To honor this commitment, Delcath has implemented updated quality systems throughout our organization. Delcath’s quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product, component specification process and the manufacturing, sale and servicing of the product. These systems are designed to enable us to satisfy the various international quality system regulations including those of the FDA with respect to products sold in the United States and those established by the International Standards Organization (“ISO”) with respect to products sold in the EEA. The Company is  required to maintain ISO 13485 certification for medical devices to be sold in the EEA, which requires, among other items, an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. On February 17, 2011, we announced that we had achieved ISO 13485 certification for our Queensbury manufacturing facility. On December 28, 2011, we announced that we had achieved ISO 13485 certification for our Galway, Ireland facility.  All Delcath facilties are presently ISO 13485:2016 certified.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, Delcath had 43 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union and we believe our employee relationships are good.
