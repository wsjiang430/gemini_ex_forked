BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
 
We own commercial real estate assets and interests in clinical pharmaceutical companies. The assets are operated as two separate lines of business and we are looking to increase the value of both of our holdings.
Real Estate
 
The commercial real estate holdings consist of the building at 520 Broad Street in Newark, New Jersey that serves as headquarters for the Company and, certain affiliated entities, an 800-car public garage, an office/data center building in Piscataway, New Jersey and a portion of a building in Israel.
 
520 Broad Street in Newark New Jersey is a 20-story commercial office building containing approximately 496,000 square feet.  The building was completed in 1957 and is of steel-frame construction with cast-in-place concrete floors.  The facade is constructed of stone and metal framed glass curtain wall sections. The public garage has three levels, plus additional surface parking that, in total, can accommodate approximately 800 parking spaces. We have retained a leading real estate brokerage firm to market the building for potential sale while we continue to attempt to maximize the value of our holdings by leasing activity and improvements. The Newark market is undergoing a renewal with major commercial and residential projects currently in development or coming to the market. The building also sits within an Opportunity Zone providing additional upside to potential purchasers.


The building serves as the headquarters of Rafael Holdings, IDT, and Genie Energy, Ltd. (“Genie”), who occupy the second through fourth floors. Currently, approximately 30% of the building is leased, including leases to IDT and Genie.
 
The IDT lease expires in April 2025 and is for 80,000 square feet and includes two parking spots per thousand square feet of space leased. The annual base rent is approximately $1.6 million. IDT has the right to terminate the lease upon four months’ notice and, upon early termination, IDT will pay a penalty equal to 25% of the portion of the rent due over the course of the remaining term. IDT has the right to lease an additional 50,000 square feet in the building at the same terms as the base lease, in 25,000 square feet increments. Upon expiration of the lease, IDT has the right to renew the lease for another five years on substantially the same terms, with a 2% increase in the rental payments.
 
The Genie lease expires in April 2025 and is for 8,631 square feet and includes two parking spots per thousand square feet of space leased. The annual base rent is approximately $200,000. Genie has the right to terminate the lease upon four months’ notice and, upon early termination, Genie will pay a penalty equal to 25% of the portion of the rent due over the course of the remaining term. Upon expiration of the lease, Genie has the right to renew the lease for another five years on substantially the same terms, with a 2% increase in the rental payments.
 
In addition to the IDT and Genie leases, there are three additional leases for space in the building. The first lease is for a portion of the sixth floor for an eleven-year term, of which the first six years are non-cancellable. The second lease is for a portion of the ground floor and basement for a term of ten years, seven months and the third lease is for another portion of the ground floor for a term of ten years, four months. The leases have all commenced. At July 31, 2019 and July 31, 2018, the carrying value of the land, building and improvements at 520 Broad Street was $43.8 million and $45.2 million, respectively.
 
The building in Piscataway is located at 225 Old New Brunswick Road. It is a three-story commercial office building containing approximately 65,000 square feet. The building was completed in 1978. Since its completion, the building has been leased as data space and therefore has ample power, diverse paths of fiber, back-up generators and dedicated HVAC units. Currently, approximately 28% of the building is leased to two data users. Both leases are to tenants who each occupy a portion of the first floor. One lease expires at the end of 2020 and the other lease expires at the end of October 2022. We have commenced efforts to upgrade the building’s aesthetics and infrastructure and initiated a lobby upgrade. We have retained Colliers International to market the building for potential sale. The marketing efforts were initiated in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and are ongoing. We are also marketing the space for lease to the office and data center market.
 
The real estate holding in Israel is a condominium portion of an office building built in 2004 located in the Har Hotzvim section of Jerusalem, Israel. The condominium is one floor of approximately 12,400 square feet. Har Hotzvim is a high-tech industrial park located in northwest Jerusalem. It is the city’s main zone for science-based and technology companies, among them Intel, Teva and Mobileye. As of July 31, 2019, the space is fully leased to 2 tenants; one is IDT and another third-party tenant.
 
Depreciation and amortization expense of property, plant and equipment was $1.8 million and $1.7 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.

Rafael Pharmaceuticals 
 
We own interests/rights in Rafael Pharmaceuticals through a 90%-owned non-operating subsidiary, IDT-Rafael Holdings, LLC, or IDT-Rafael Holdings. IDT-Rafael Holdings holds 36.7 million shares of Rafael Pharmaceuticals Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and a warrant to increase ownership to up to 56% of the fully diluted equity interests in Rafael Pharmaceuticals (the “Warrant”). The Warrant is exercisable at the lower of 70% of the price sold in an equity financing, or $1.25 per share, subject to certain adjustments, and will expire upon the earlier of December 31, 2020, a qualified initial public offering, or liquidation event of Rafael Pharmaceuticals.
 
IDT-Rafael Holdings also owns 50% of CS Pharma Holdings, LLC (“CS Pharma”), a non-operating entity that holds 16.7 million shares of Rafael Pharmaceuticals Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. Accordingly, the Company holds an effective 45% indirect interest in the assets held by CS Pharma.
 
Howard Jonas, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Chairman of the Board of Rafael Pharmaceuticals owns 10% of IDT-Rafael Holdings.


IDT-Rafael Holdings also holds certain governance rights in Rafael Pharmaceuticals including appointment of directors.
 
We and our subsidiaries collectively own securities representing 51% of the outstanding capital stock of Rafael Pharmaceuticals and 38% of the capital stock on a fully diluted basis (excluding the remainder of the Warrant).

The Series D Convertible Preferred Stock has a stated value of $1.25 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment to reflect any stock split, combination, reclassification or reorganization of the Series D Preferred Stock or any dilutive issuances, as described below). Holders of Series D Stock are entitled to receive non-cumulative dividends when, as and if declared by the board of Rafael Pharmaceuticals, prior to any dividends to any other class of capital stock of Rafael Pharmaceuticals. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, or in the event of any deemed liquidation, proceeds from such liquidation, dissolution, winding up shall be distribute first to the holders of Series D Stock. Except with respect to certain major decisions, or as required by law, holders of Series D Stock vote together with the holders of the other preferred stock and common stock and not as a separate class.
 
We serve as the managing member of IDT-Rafael Holdings and IDT-Rafael Holdings serves as the managing member of CS Pharma, with broad authority to make all key decisions regarding their respective holdings. Any distributions that are made to CS Pharma from Rafael Pharmaceuticals that are in turn distributed by CS Pharma, will need to be made pro rata to all members, which would entitle IDT-Rafael Holdings to 50% (based on current ownership) of such distributions. Similarly, if IDT-Rafael Holdings were to distribute proceeds it receives from CS Pharma, it would do so on a pro rata basis, entitled the Company to 90% (based on current ownership) of such distributions.
   
Separately, Howard Jonas and Deborah Jonas jointly own $525,000 of Series C Convertible Notes of Rafael Pharmaceuticals, and The Howard S. and Deborah Jonas Foundation owns $525,000 of Series C Notes of Rafael Pharmaceuticals.
 
On September 19, 2017, IDT approved a compensatory arrangement with Howard Jonas related to the right held by IDT-Rafael Holdings to receive additional Rafael Pharmaceutical shares (“Bonus Shares”) upon the achievement of certain milestones. Under that arrangement, IDT transferred to Howard Jonas the contractual right to receive “Bonus Shares” for an additional 10% of the fully diluted capital stock of Rafael Pharmaceuticals at the time of issuance that was previously held by IDT-Rafael Holdings, which is contingent upon achieving certain milestones. This right was previously held by IDT-Rafael Holdings, subject to its right to transfer to recipients that IDT-Rafael Holdings, in its sole discretion, felt merit because of special efforts by such persons in assisting Rafael Pharmaceuticals and its products. IDT-Rafael Holdings distributed the rights to its members and transferred the portion it received to Howard Jonas. If any of the milestones are met, the Bonus Shares are to be issued without any additional payment. Howard Jonas has the right to transfer the Bonus Shares, in his discretion, to others, including those who are instrumental to the future success of Rafael Pharmaceuticals. These milestones have not yet been met and no bonus shares have been issued.

Science and Preclinical:
 
Rafael Pharmaceuticals is developing its lead product CPI-613® (devimistat), an investigational new drug for the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. This molecule has been developed based on Altered Metabolism Directed (AMD) platform. It is a small molecule and suitable for intravenous (IV) administration.
 
In the 1920’s, Nobel Prize winner Dr. Otto Warburg observed that cancer cells metabolize glucose differently than normal cells. More recently it has been recognized that tumor-specific alteration of metabolism is pervasive, affecting all metabolic processes. Both cytosolic and mitochondrial processes are crucially transformed during the evolution of metastatic disease. This profoundly altered metabolism of cancer cells has recently emerged as one of the most promising new domains for therapeutic targeting of cancer. In most cancer cells, uptake of glucose is substantially increased. Glucose is metabolized to pyruvate which then is either reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or oxidized to acetyl coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA) by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) for introduction into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The Acetyl-CoA then can be used for either energy generation or biosynthetic intermediate production, both crucial to tumor cell survival. Glutamine is an additional carbon source, also essential for sustaining the TCA cycle in tumor cells. Glutamine transport and metabolism are also upregulated in many tumor types. Glutamine is converted to glutamate and then to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). α-KG is then converted to succinyl-CoA by α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) for subsequent processing through the TCA cycle. The regulation of this metabolism of pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate is profoundly altered in tumor cells, presenting potential clinical targets, as discussed immediately below.
 
CPI-613® (devimistat) is a stable analog of normally transient, acylated catalytic intermediates of lipoate. These intermediates normally serve as signals to the PDH and KGDH regulatory systems altered in cancer; thus, CPI-613® (devimistat) misinforms these tumor systems, selectively turning off the cancer cell TCA cycle. CPI-613® (devimistat) tumor selectivity is further enhanced because cancer cells take up the drug preferentially. More specifically, CPI-613® (devimistat) selectively inactivates PDH in tumor cells by hyper-activating the corresponding tumor-specific configuration of regulatory Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDKs). PDKs phosphorylate and inactivate PDH. As well, CPI-613® (devimistat) simultaneously inactivates KGDH by hyper-activating a redox feedback loop normally controlling the enzyme’s activity and reconfigured in tumors. The simultaneous inhibition of these two TCA cycle enzymes dramatically compromises mitochondrial metabolic flows, triggering multiple, redundant apoptotic and necrotic cell death pathways selectively in tumor cells [Zachar et al., J Mol Med (Berl). 2011 Nov;89(11):1137-48; Stuart et al., Cancer Metab. 2014 Mar 10;2(1): reviewed in Bingham et al., Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol. 2014 Nov;7(6):837-46 and Hammoudi et al., Chin J Cancer. 2011 Aug;30(8):508-25]. Rafael Pharmaceuticals also continues to develop extensive insight into this drug family.
 
There are many potential advantages of CPI-613® (devimistat) over alternative anti-metabolism and anti-cancer drugs. It is believed to selectively targets altered metabolism in cancer cells. Therefore, CPI-613® (devimistat) is expected to be minimally toxic to healthy cells (i.e. safe and well tolerated), allows extended treatment courses (reducing likelihood of relapse). Moreover, its low side-effect toxicity allows CPI-613® (devimistat) to be used in combination with other drugs, including established standards of care for major malignancies and allows to treat surgically unresectable cancers. Further, this benevolent toxicity profile allows treatment of vulnerable, elderly patients. CPI-613® (devimistat) attacks multiple, individually essential targets (PDH, KGDH). So, we expect that it will be less susceptible to emergence of drug resistance. The redesign of metabolism is general to most or all cancers. Thus, it is also expected to have broad spectrum activity of CPI-613® (devimistat), i.e. the potential to treat different cancers including difficult-to-treat cancers, high risk cancers. and advanced stage cancers. By targeting metabolism, Rafael Pharmaceuticals expects the drug to be effective against formerly resistant tumor types and suppress metabolism-based drug-resistance.
 
Several pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies [including good laboratory practice toxicology (GLP Tox) studies] were conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), drug metabolism, safety and anticancer activity of CPI-613® (devimistat). In in vitro and ex vivo studies, CPI-613® (devimistat) exhibited strong anticancer activities against an array (including solid tumors or hematologic malignancies) of tumor cell-lines and cells derived from patients (including patients with drug resistance). These anti-cancer activities were significantly higher compared to untreated cells or cells treated with current chemotherapeutic agents. In contrast, CPI-613® (devimistat) was either minimally taken up into or produced little effect in a variety of healthy cells. In pre-clinical combination therapy studies, CPI-613® (devimistat) exhibited no additive toxicity. The drug also demonstrated significant synergy with other chemotherapeutic agents (Pardee et. al. Clin Cancer Res. 2018 May 1;24(9):2060-2073). In vivo animal models bearing diverse tumor types were used to evaluate dose response, PK and metabolism of CPI-613® (devimistat). The drug was well-tolerated in all animal models. Prolonged survival was observed when compared to untreated controls and more commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. GLP toxicology studies showed that any events related to CPI-613® (devimistat) were transient and mostly observed during dosing, and animals returned to normal post-dose (i.e. toxicities were reversable or recoverable). Toxicokinetic (TK) exposures of Cmax (peak concentration) and area under curve (AUC) of CPI-613® (devimistat) from GLP Tox studies in rats and minipigs have shown very good safety margins to cover PK exposures of Cmax and AUC of CPI-613® (devimistat) from AML and pancreatic cancer patients in clinical trials, i.e. safety margins of 2.5 – 11.6 folds based on the highest observed Cmax and AUC at maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from 13-week rat and 13-week minipigs studies divided by the highest observed Cmax and AUC at MTD of CPI-613® (devimistat) in combination with chemotherapies in AML and pancreatic cancer patients.
 
The manufacturing of CPI-613® (devimistat) is relatively low cost, efficient, and scalable. In addition to intravenous CPI-613® (devimistat), development of oral formulation of CPI-613® (devimistat) is currently underway.

Clinical:
 
More than 350 patients were dosed with CPI-613® (devimistat) to date in 16 ongoing or completed clinical trials.
 
Five new trials started enrolling participants (including 2 Phase III trials)
 
Pancreatic Cancer: CPI-613® (devimistat) in Combination with Modified FOLFIRINOX in First-Line Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer.
 
Twenty patients were enrolled in this study. The MTD of CPI-613® (devimistat) was 500 mg/m². The median number of treatment cycles given at the maximum tolerated dose was 11. Two patients were enrolled at a higher dose of 1000 mg/m2, and both had a dose-limiting toxicity. No deaths due to adverse events were reported. For the 18 patients given the maximum tolerated dose, the most common grade 3–4 non-hematological adverse events were hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The most common grade 3–4 hematological adverse events were neutropenia, lymphopenia, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia. Sensory neuropathy (all grade 1–3) was recorded in 17 out of the 18 patients and was managed with dose de-escalation or discontinuation of oxaliplatin per standard of care. Of the 18 patients given the maximum tolerated dose, 11 (61%) patients achieved an objective response (complete or partial). Patients exhibited a median overall survival (OS) of 19.9 months and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.9 months. The interim result of this study was published in Lancet Oncology (Alistar et al., Lancet Oncol. 2017 Jun;18(6):770-778.). Given that in clinical trial evaluating the FOLFIRINOX regimen reported an objective response rate (ORR) of 31.6%, , median OS of 11.1 months and median PFS of 6.4 months (Conroy et al., N Engl J Med 2011;364:1817-25.) the further evaluation of CPI-613® (devimistat) in pancreatic cancer is believed to be warranted.
 
Based on the clinical experience of this trial in pancreatic cancer, Rafael has initiated a phase III pivotal trial (AVENGER 500®) of CPI-613® (devimistat) in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in December 2018. This trial will compare the efficacy and safety of FOLFIRINOX (FFX, control arm) with CPI-613® (devimistat) in combination with mFFX. Patients 18-75 years old of both sexes with metastatic (stage IV) pancreatic adenocarcinoma, not previously treated for metastatic disease and with ECOG performance status of 0 – 1 are eligible for enrollment in this study. The interim analysis of the study is estimated to be completed in the third quarter of the 2020 calendar year.
 
Acute Myeloid Leukemia: CPI-613® (devimistat) in Combination with High Dose Cytarabine and Mitoxantrone in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
 
Two trials were conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of CPI-613® (devimistat) in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. The result of the phase 1 study was published in Clinical Cancer Research (Pardee et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2018 May 1;24(9):2060-2073). Overall, the treatment was well tolerated. Pooled dataset of both phase I and phase II trials in elderly patients (≥ 60 years) with relapsed or refractory AML demonstrated 52% CR + CRi and median OS of 12.4 months. Given that in clinical trial evaluating high dose cytarabine, mitoxantrone and L-asparaginase in relapsed or refractory AML in elderly patients (≥ 60 years) demonstrated 33% CR + CRi and median OS of only 5.2 months (Ahmed et al., Leuk Res. 2015 September ; 39(9): 945–949.), further evaluation of CPI-613® (devimistat) in AML is believed to be warranted.
 
Based on the clinical experience in these trials in AML, Rafael Pharmaceuticals has initiated a phase III pivotal trial (ARMADA 2000) of CPI-613® (devimistat) in patients with relapsed or refractory AML in November 2018. This study will compare the efficacy and safety of high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone (HAM, control arm) with CPI-613® (devimistat) in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone (CHAM). Patients ≥ 60 years with relapsed or refractory AML and an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 are eligible for this study. The interim analysis of the study is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020.
 
Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma: Phase I Dose-Escalation Study of CPI-613® (devimistat), in Combination with Bendamustine, in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory T-cell Lymphoma
 
To date, 10 patients have received at least one dose of CPI-613® (devimistat) in combination with bendamustine. 8 patients are evaluable for safety and efficacy. Overall, the patients exhibited a good safety profile. The most common grade 3 or higher toxicities were lymphopenia and neutropenia. CPI-613® (devimistat) in combination with bendamustine exhibited very good signal of efficacy with 75% ORR, 9.2 months median OS and 6.4 months median PFS. All 3 patients with CR were diagnosed with peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). Although the numbers are small, continued investigation is warranted as these response rates in a poor risk population of patients with relapsed or refractory T-Cell Lymphoma are very exciting.

LipoMedix
 
LipoMedix is a clinical-stage, privately held Israeli company focused on the development of an innovative, safe and effective cancer therapy based on liposome delivery.
 
Rafael Holding holds 50.6% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of LipoMedix.
 
In Fiscal 2019 and 2018, we provided debt and equity financing of $250,000 and $875,000, respectively, to LipoMedix.
 
Science and Preclinical:
 
LipoMedix was established in order to advance the pharmaceutical and clinical development of a patented prodrug of mitomycin-C and its efficient delivery in liposomes to cancer-affected target organs. LipoMedix believes that this formulation, known as Promitil® – Pegylated Liposomal Mitomycin-C Lipidic Prodrug (PL-MLP) – overcomes the problems associated with the mitomycin-C toxicity of certain current treatments and turns it into passively targeted, anti-cancer drug that could potentially become the therapy of choice in a variety of cancers. The inventor and scientific founder, of LipoMedix is Alberto Gabizon, M.D., Ph.D., of the Hebrew University – Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Israel who is also the co-inventor and co-developer of Doxil® (doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection), a successful and widely-used anticancer product based on a similar drug development strategy. Prof. Gabizon is one of the few scientists intimately familiar with the successful development and commercialization process of liposomal drugs.
 
Promitil® is an innovative nanomedicine designed for controlled delivery of a chemotherapeutic agent in a proprietary prodrug form. LipoMedix believes it may have advantages over conventional anticancer agents that have serious adverse side effects, and limited efficacy with resistance to treatment. Promitil® is based on an innovative and breakthrough technology that could potentially help cancer patients receive safer therapy with a more potent anti- tumor effect.
 
In preclinical trials, Promitil® inhibited a range of cancer types in animal models (pancreatic, colorectal, stomach, breast, ovarian, melanoma) and potentiated the activity of various co-administered cancer drugs. The API (MLP), a prodrug of mitomycin C, is carried by a pegylated liposomal delivery system that confers an extended circulation time in vivo and enhanced delivery to tumors. In preclinical trials, Promitil® significantly reduced mitomycin-C’s systemic toxicity and mitigated its side-effects. Promitil® is a highly stable formulation with prolonged storage shelf life of over 4-5 years.

Clinical:
 
A total of 88 patients have been treated with Promitil® as a single agent or in combination with other anticancer drugs under the framework of a phase 1A/1B clinical study. Promitil® was well tolerated and safe for use at a broad dose range. The majority of the adverse events reported were mild to moderate and unrelated to the study drug.
 
A Phase IA dose escalation open trial (Golan et al., “Pegylated liposomal mitomycin C prodrug enhances tolerance of mitomycin C: a phase 1 study in advanced solid tumor patients.” Cancer Medicine, 4:1472–1483, 2015) has demonstrated that Promitil® has successfully and substantially modified the pharmacokinetic characteristics of mitomycin C delivery, resulting in the ability to clinically administer much larger amounts of active drug (approximately 3 times greater mitomycin C-equivalent dose than the maximal tolerated dose of mitomycin C), with an acceptable toxicity profile, and with long circulation time to ensure adequate tumor drug delivery.
 
A Phase IB continuation trial in advanced colon cancer patients receiving Promitil® as 3rd line therapy has confirmed the safety and pharmacokinetic features of Promitil® in this patient population, as well as the feasibility of combining Promitil® with Bevacizumab and/or Capecitabine. This stage of colon cancer has an ominous patient prognosis with median survival of approximately 5 months for untreated patients, and 6 – 7 months using any of the two approved therapies (Regorafenib, TAS-102), and a rate of objective partial responses (tumor shrinkage) nearly zero.
 
In this phase 1B study, 40% (21/52) of patients that underwent disease evaluation on week 9-12 of study showed Stable Disease with a 1-year survival rate of 52% and median survival of 13.9 months (Phase 1 Clinical Study Report, data on file at LipoMedix), suggesting that Promitil® activity in colon cancer is substantial, but requires confirmation in phase 2 studies. LipoMedix believes that the next development step should be to conduct a Phase 2B trial of Promitil® against an active comparator (e.g. Regorafenib) using as endpoints PFS and OS, which will provide information on the added value of Promitil® in colorectal cancer. LipoMedix believes that an approximately 100-patient strong study should determine the relative value of Promitil® in advanced colorectal carcinoma. Given the large number of patients with this condition, LipoMedix anticipates this study can be completed relatively quickly (approximate enrollment time 18 months) with centers in 4 countries only. An IND application for this study has been approved by the FDA in November 2018. An effective treatment for this patient population represents an important unmet clinical need that Promitil® will attempt to fill, and for which LipoMedix intends to pursue a 505b2 NDA regulatory strategy with a 5-year exclusivity period entitled to new chemical entities.
 
Additional trials with LipoMedix flagship product, Promitil®, undergoing or in planning include:
 

§ | Phase 1B open study of Promitil® in combination with radiotherapy in patients with inoperable or metastatic cancers and oligometastases (Liporad Study). This is a separate avenue of clinical development sprouting from preclinical observations (Tian X. et al., Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2016 Nov 1;96(3):547-55), and from several positive responses to the combination of Promitil® and radiotherapy in compassionately treated patients (Tahover et al., Front Oncol. 2018 Nov 26;8:544.): mechanistic basis and preliminary clinical experience”). This phase 1B study of Promitil®, approved by the Israel MOH, has been initiated in January 2019 in 3 clinical sites in Israel.

Promitil®-based products:
 
In addition to Promitil®, LipoMedix has developed a pipeline of Promitil®-based products with potentially important applications:
 

● | Folate-targeted Promitil® (Promi-Fol), aimed at local treatment (intravesical) of superficial bladder cancer. Decorating Promitil® with folate ligands exploits the frequent overexpression of folate receptors in urothelial cancers for selective and enhanced delivery of Promitil® to cancer cells. Promi-Fol could be a safe and effective therapeutic alternative to widely used instillation of mitomycin-c for local treatment of the growing elderly patient population with superficial bladder cancer. LipoMedix has completed a GLP animal study demonstrating the safety of Promi-Fol administered by the intravesical route and is seeking a partner for sublicense of this technology and testing in clinical studies. A patent application to cover PromiFol has been submitted.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Promi-Dox, a highly potent dual drug liposome with MLP and doxorubicin (the “SuperDoxil”) for a basket of tumors. If a strong clinical signal can be detected there are several possible cancer settings with substantial patient numbers and significant unmet need where PromiDox could be utilized. This formulation requires further product development. A patent application to cover PromiDox has been submitted.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property:
 
Two new patent applications covering the use of Promitil®, in combination with other chemotherapies and with radiotherapy have been approved by the USPTO in 2018.

REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF DRUGS IN THE UNITED STATES
 
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
 
Each of Rafael Pharmaceuticals’ and LipoMedix’s (collectively, referred to as “the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies”) product candidates must be approved by the FDA through a New Drug Application, or NDA. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
 

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, and the purity and stability of the drug substance, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA, to the IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.

A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain FDA regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Such studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND before a clinical trial can begin in the US. In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 
Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition (e.g., cancer) and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
Phase 3. These clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the investigator brochure.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

If clinical trials are successful, the next step in the drug development process is the preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA, Biologics License Application. The NDA or BLA is the vehicle through which drug applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new drug or biologic for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, products with orphan drug designation are not subject to user fees.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to identify if there are any deficiencies before it can officially accept them for in-depth review, also known as ‘filing’ of the NDA. The FDA may also request additional information before deciding whether to accept an NDA application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA.
 
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug or biologic. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if deemed required.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product is to be manufactured. These preapproval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 
The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions about the approval of the drug.
 
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either submit a Complete Response, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
Fast track, breakthrough therapy and priority review designations 
 
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and priority review designation.
 
Accelerated approval pathway
 
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. If post-marketing clinical studies fail to verify clinical benefit, FDA may withdraw approval.
 
10

 

Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any drug that receives FDA approval is subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, by submitting supplemental NDAs, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.

Abbreviated new drug applications for generic drugs
 
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.
 
505(b)(2) NDAs
 
As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA pursuant to an NDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically and legally appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the previously approved reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Pediatric studies and exclusivity
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of FDASIA 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and any other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to waiver requests, deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless and until FDA promulgates a regulation stating otherwise, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. The first applicant to obtain approval of an orphan drug is eligible for seven years of exclusivity, or twelve years of exclusivity for a biologic, during which FDA may not approve another drug with the same active ingredient for the approved orphan indication unless the subsequent product is shown to be clinically superior.
 
Patent term restoration and extension
 
A patent claiming a new drug product or its method of use may be eligible for a limited patent term extension, also known as patent term restoration, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. Patent term extension is generally available only for drug products whose active ingredient has not previously been approved by the FDA. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.
 
12

 

FDA approval and regulation of companion diagnostics
 
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling.
 
REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF DRUGS IN EUROPE AND OTHER FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the extent they choose to sell any drug products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product in the European Union, a manufacturer must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency or EMA. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are to be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
PHARMACEUTICAL COVERAGE, PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT
 
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Even if our product candidate is approved, sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 
There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may successfully develop and for which they may obtain marketing approval and may affect their overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates. 
 
HEALTHCARE LAW AND REGULATION

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of drug products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
13

 


● | the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | state laws requiring pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Rafael Pharmaceutical’s immediate goal is extending and enhancing the lives of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers (along with selected hematological malignancies) with immediate objective to improve the quality of life of patients with pancreatic cancer, which is believed to be the deadliest cancer worldwide with very limited treatment options.
 
As per Rahib et al, 2014; Pancreatic Cancer will surpass breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers by 2030 and will become the second leading causes of cancer-related death. Since 1997, the median overall survival following standard frontline therapies in metastatic pancreatic cancer has increased from 6.8 months (gemcitabine) to 11.1 months (FOLFIRINOX) (Conroy et al., N Engl J Med 2011;364:1817-25. Von Hoff et al., N Engl J Med 2013;369:1691-703). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an immune-privileged cancer and appears to escape from the antitumor immune response unlike other neoplastic entities. In PDAC, response rate with immune checkpoint inhibitors anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) alone or in combination is not satisfactory to date (Kabacaoglu et al., Front Immunol. 2018 Aug 15;9:1878).
 
In an early stage trial, CPI-613® (devimistat) in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX exhibited a promising signal of efficacy with 61% objective response rate (ORR), 19.9 months overall survival (OS) and 9.9 months progression-free survival (PFS). The combination was also well tolerated. This is in comparison to the earlier clinical trial evaluating the FOLFIRINOX regimen for approval wherein they reported an ORR of 31.6%, median OS of 11.1 months and median PFS of 6.4 months (Conroy et al., N Engl J Med 2011;364:1817-25.) the further evaluation of CPI-613® (devimistat) in pancreatic cancer is warranted.
 
As a part of the immediate goal of the Company to improve the quality of life of patients with pancreatic cancer, Rafael Pharmaceutical has initiated following trials:
 

1. | A phase III pivotal trial (AVENGER 500®) of CPI-613® (devimistat) in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The interim analysis of the study is expected to be completed as early as the third quarter of the 2020 calendar year. The goal of this trial is to provide compelling evidence of the safety and efficacy and leading to a regulatory approval for CPI-613® (devimistat) for use in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of pancreas.

2. | A phase I study of CPI-613® (devimistat) in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The phase II/III trial in this setting is estimated to start in 2019.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | A phase II study of CPI-613® (devimistat) in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
FOLFIRINOX / FOLFOX / FOLFIRI are standard of care for several gastrointestinal (GI) cancers (e.g. colorectal, esophagus, anal canal). With a broadly applicable mechanism of action, Rafael Pharmaceutical expects that CPI-613® (devimistat) will also exhibit promising safety and efficacy profiles in GI cancers where FOLFIRINOX is used as standard of care. With this expectation, Rafael Pharmaceutical is planning to initiate a phase I/II trial of devimistat in combination with FOLFOX and bevacizumab.
 
LipoMedix Strategy


The strategy for LipoMedix is as follows:
 

1. | Continue phase 1B trial (LIPORAD) of Promitil® in combination with radiotherapy in Israel and extend it to Europe and/or United States, after consultation with the FDA/EMA on the best regulatory path for approval.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Initiate the study of Promitil® with concurrent chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer in United States.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Continue clinical development of Promitil® for advanced colon cancer within a phase 2B trial.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Continue research and development, toxicity, and product development of LipoMedix’s pipeline aiming at out-licensing for Folate-targeted Promitil® (PromiFol) and PromiDox.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Strengthening the intellectual property to cover the product manufacturing process and securing the robustness of the manufacturing process.

Manufacturing
 
The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities or fill-and-finish facilities. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of their product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that they may commercialize. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies obtain our supplies from these established contract manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have a long-term supply arrangement in place. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply for bulk drug substance or drug product. For all of the product candidates, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulation and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of a new drug application to the FDA or along the first steps of marketing.
 
For Rafael Pharmaceuticals, the compounds are organic compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale-up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. Rafael Pharmaceuticals expects to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced relatively cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
 
LipoMedix’s Promitil and other pipeline candidates, are based on an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) referred to as MLP (abbreviation of mitomycin-C lipid-based prodrug) that is formulated into customized nanoparticles. These nanoparticles consist of lipids and a polyethylene-glycol (PEG) polymer and are known as pegylated liposomes. MLP is currently synthesized by a third party using a proprietary, reliable and reproducible synthetic process from readily available raw materials. The MLP API is then shipped to another third-party facility specialized in liposome manufacture for clinical use. In principle, a single batch of API can serve for manufacture of several batches of Promitil liposomes.
 
The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics they develop.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of October 2, 2019, we had 17 full and no part-time employees primarily dedicated to the real estate group and corporate entity. We have begun to expand our team in the pharmaceutical sector. Rafael Pharmaceuticals employs 26 full-time and 4 part-time employees, who are involved in operations, research and development and LipoMedix employs 2 full-time and 2 part-time employees involved in operations, research and development, in addition to Prof. Gabizon.
