Item 1. Description of Business
Company Information

ShiftPixy, Inc (PIXY-Nasdaq), “ShiftPixy”, or the “Company” was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on June 3, 2015. Our principal executive office is located at 1 Venture, Suite 150, Irvine, CA 92618, and our telephone number is (888) 798-9100. Our website address is www.shiftpixy.com. We do not incorporate the information on or accessible through our website into this Report, and you should not consider any information on, or that can be accessed through our website as a part of this Report.

ShiftPixy Human Capital Management Inc., d/b/a ShiftableHR

In December, 2015 we formed Shift Human Capital Management Inc., d/b/a/ ShiftableHR, (“SHCM”) a wholly owned subsidiary. We formed this subsidiary in response to the need to have workers’ compensation policies written in the names of the clients (as may be required by some states) and otherwise in response to client needs for only administrative and processing services rather than the assignment of employees, particularly temporary employees, as offered by ShiftPixy. Under this subsidiary, under circumstances wherein the client remains as the sole employer of the subject employees, we act as a payroll processor, human resources consultant, and administrator of workers’ compensation coverages and claims (providing “administrative services only”). For administrative reasons, we believe that providing these services through a separate legal entity seemed advisable and required, and thus we formed the subsidiary to provide these services. Our goal is to migrate these clients to ShiftPixy. We consolidate all operations of SCHM into the financial statements of ShiftPixy.

Business Overview

Our current business, and the primary source of our revenues to date, has been under a traditional staffing services business model. Our initial market focus is to use this traditional approach, coupled with developed technology, and address an underserved market containing predominately lower wage employees with high turnover, in light industrial, services, and food and hospitality. The Company provides Human Resources, employment compliance, insurance, payroll, and operational employment services solutions for our business clients (“clients”) and shift work or “gig” opportunities for worksite employees (“WSEs”). We receive admin or processing fees as a percentage of a business client’s gross payroll, process and file payroll taxes and payroll tax returns, provide workers compensation insurance, and provide employee benefits. We have built a substantial business on a recurring revenue model since our inception in 2015 and we currently process in excess of $400 million of annualized payroll billings, based on $105 million of payroll billings for our fourth fiscal quarter of 2019. Our business grew in both billings and billable worksite employees in excess of 50% year over year for each year since inception and is expected to continue a high degree of growth. We have experienced losses to date as we have invested in both our technology solutions as well as the back-office operations required to service a large employee base under a traditional staffing model.

We provide services to businesses and we define a “client” as any business paying us to provide employee related services. We are currently focused on clients in the restaurant and hospitality industries, traditionally market segments with high employee turnover and low pay rates; however, we have clients in a variety of other industries as well. All have written client service agreements. The basic client agreement is substantially similar for all clients, with minor modifications to fit each client’s specific situation, and some differences to account for whether the engagement is with ShiftPixy or its wholly owned subsidiary, Shift Human Capital Management Inc.

Our founders’ initial goal was to bring Employment Administration Services (“EAS”) and traditional staffing services (“Staffing”) to an underserved segment of the market; namely small businesses who lack HR and Payroll infrastructure and therefore struggle with the HR compliance requirements and high turnover that is prevalent for many businesses who employ lower income and part time workers. Since our inception in 2015, we have built a client employee pool of over 25,000 persons that is populated by lower wage employees, averaging approximately $22,000 per year and for personnel typically under 35 years of age. We believe that by accumulating together a large number of low-wage and younger employee population, we will obtain a competitive advantage and increase revenues and profits through increased services over and above our base service offering to better serve the younger demographic through our technology solution.

Beginning in 2015, our core business model is to provide payroll services and to facilitate workers compensation insurance to small businesses in exchange for an administration fee calculated as a percentage of their gross payroll. Our initial market focus was to provide a suite of payroll services for small businesses who hire lower income and part-time workers in a high employee turnover environment and struggle to comply with costly employee related “soft” costs such as workers compensation and governmental compliance. We provide such services by employing an operations team consisting of taxation, customer service, HR Compliance, benefits, and workers compensation specialists and which allows us to deliver “best practices” HR, tax compliance, workers compensation insurance, and payroll services at a lower cost than it would cost our clients to provide on their own.

Our revenues through the end of fiscal 2019 primarily consist of admin fees calculated as a percentage of gross payroll processed, payroll taxes due on worksite employees billed to the client and remitted to the taxation authority, and workers compensation premiums billed to the client for which we facilitate workers compensation coverage. Our costs of revenues consist of the accrued and paid payroll taxes and our costs to provide the workers compensation coverage including premiums and loss reserves. A significant portion of our assets and liabilities is for our workers compensation reserves, carried as cash balances, and our estimates of projected workers compensation claims, carried as liabilities. For 2019, we provide a self-funded workers compensation policy up to $500,000 and purchase reinsurance for claims in excess of $500,000. As of August 31, 2019, we have workers compensation related assets that are approximately $1.9 million higher than our projected workers compensation losses, or approximately 25% of the asset total as of August 31, 2019. We also actively and closely monitor and manage our clients and worksite employees’ workers compensation claims which allow us to provide a lower cost option for our clients than they would otherwise be able to purchase on their own. We believe that our customer value proposition is to provide the combination of overall net cost savings to the client as follows:


· | Payroll tax compliance and management services 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Governmental HR compliance such as for the Affordable Care Act compliance requirements
· | Reduced client workers compensation premiums or enhanced coverage 
· | Access to an employee pool of potential applicants to reduce turnover costs 
· | Offset by increased administrative fee cost to the client payable to ShiftPixy 

   Our founders believed that providing this baseline business, coupled with a technology solution to address additional concerns such as employee scheduling and turnover, would provide a unique, cost effective solution to the HR compliance, staffing, and scheduling problems that faced these businesses. Our next goal, currently underway, is to match the small business needs of companies with paying “gigs” with a fully compliant and lower cost staffing solution. For this, we need to acquire a significant number of worksite employees (“WSE”) to provide our paying clients with a variety of solutions for their unique staffing needs and facilitate the employment relationship. 

Managing, recruiting, and scheduling a large number of low wage employees can be both difficult and expensive. The acquisition and recruiting of such an employee population is highly labor intensive and therefore have high customer acquisition costs in part due to high onboarding and maintenance costs such as tax information capture or I-9 verification. Early in our history, we evaluated these costs and determined that proper process flows, automated with blockchain and cloud technology and coupled with access to lower cost workers compensation policies resulting from economies of scale could result in a profitable and low-cost scalable business model. To that end, 

over the past four years, the Company has invested heavily in a robust, cloud-based Human Resources Information System (HRIS) platform in order to: 


· | reduce WSE management costs, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | automate new WSE and client onboarding, and 
· | provide additional value-add services for our business clients resulting in additional revenue streams to the Company

   Beginning in 2017, we began to develop our HRIS database and front-end desktop and mobile phone application to facilitate a lower and easier WSE and client onboarding as well as for additional client functionality and the opportunity for WSEs to find shift work. We outsourced the development and had delays in the launch of our application during 2018 into early 2019 due to delays with our outsourced development partner. Beginning in March 2019, we brought the development of our application in house to complete and launched the initial phase in 2019. As of August 31, 2019, the initial launch was completed and we began to provide some of the HRIS and application services to selected legacy customers on a test basis late in our fiscal year ending August 31, 2019. Subsequent to year end, we continued working to implement additional mobile application and HRIS functionality in delivery, “gig” intermediation services, and scheduling. We expect to launch some of these additional features and services in the fourth calendar quarter of 2019. We see these technology based services as multiple potential revenue drivers with limited additional costs.

Our cloud-based HRIS platform captures, holds, and processes HR and payroll information for the clients and WSEs through an easy to use customized front end interface coupled with a secure, remotely hosted database. The HRIS system can be accessed by either a desktop computer or an easy to use electronic mobile phone application designed with legally binding HR workflows in mind. Once fully implemented, we expect to reduce the time, expense, and error rate for on boarding our client employees into our HRIS ecosystem and thereby have created a technological solution for employers and their workers. Once onboarded, the client employees are included as our worksite employees and who are available for shift work within our business ecosystem. This allows our HRIS platform to serve as a “gig” marketplace for WSEs and clients and allows for client businesses to better manage their staffing needs. 

As of August 31, 2018, ShiftableHR and ShiftPixy had a combined client list of 193 clients with approximately 8,500 worksite employees. As of August 31, 2019, we had 246 clients with over 13,000 WSEs and processed payroll of over $350 million during our fiscal year ending August 31, 2019, an increase of nearly 60% from August 2018 . Of these WSEs, approximately 60% represent workers in the restaurant industry. We have an additional 12,000 WSEs as of August 31, 2019 that were retained in our HRIS system that were not active WSEs as of August 31, 2019 but which are available for “gig” opportunities.

Our Services:


To date, and throughout fiscal 2019, the core ShiftPixy client services were to provide regular payroll processing services under an employer administration services (“EAS”) model with “a la carte” additional services added as can be seen illustrated. Our payroll processing fee is typically a percentage of the gross payroll processed. We also provide workers compensation and payroll tax remittance and reporting as core services for most of our clients with additional services such as benefits administration and human resources services for additional fees. Beginning in fiscal 2020, with the full commercial launch of our mobile application software, we will provide additional services for employee scheduling and delivery as described in greater detail below. | Figure 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------


Our core EAS services are provided via standard legal contracts with our business clients, customized for each client’s specific needs and that are typically one year in length and are cancelable with 30 days’ notice. Through August 31, 2019, we have not had any material revenues or billings generated within our HRIS from additional value-added services. We consider our future service offering to be the future of the company and which will provide for additional revenue streams and support cost reductions for existing and future business clients. Future services, including technology based services provided through our HRIS system and mobile application will be through “a la carte” pricing via customizable on-line contracts.

We provide our solution in the developing nextGEN or “gig” economy primarily by absorbing our clients’ workers, who we call worksite employees (WSEs) but may also be called “shift workers,” “shifters,” “gig workers,” or “assigned employees.” WSEs are carried under a ShiftPixy corporate employee umbrella and we shoulder certain employment-related compliance responsibilities for our business clients as part of our services provided. This arrangement benefits the WSEs by opening additional work opportunities through access to other shift work with other ShiftPixy clients. The WSE further benefits from employee status benefits through ShiftPixy’s benefit plan offerings, including minimum essential health insurance coverage plans and a 401(k) plan while enjoying the protections of workers’ compensation coverage and employment laws.

Technological Solution:


At the heart of ShiftPixy’s employment service solutions is a secure, cloud-based HRIS database accessible by a desktop or mobile device through which ShiftPixy worksite employees will be enabled to find available shift work at ShiftPixy client locations. This solution solves a problem of finding available shift work for both the shifters looking for additional shift work and business clients looking to fill open shifts. For new WSEs, the mobile platform includes an easy to use WSE onboarding functionality which we believe will increase our WSE pool of workers that will provide a deep bench of worker talent for our business clients. The onboarding feature of our software enables us to capture all application process related data regarding our assigned employees and to introduce employees to and integrate them into the ShiftPixy Ecosystem. The mobile platform features a Pixy chatbot that leverages artificial intelligence to aid in gathering the data from workers via a series of questions designing to capture all required information, including customer specific and governmental information. Final onboarding steps requiring signatures can also be prepared from the HRIS onboarding module. | Figure 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------


In 2019, we implemented additional functionality to provide a scheduling component of our software, which enables each client worksite to schedule workers and to identify shift gaps that need to be filled. We utilize artificial intelligence to maintain schedules and fulfillment, using an active methodology to engage and move people to action. We began using this functionality at the end of fiscal 2019 on a test basis.

The final phase of our initial platform, deployed in late fiscal 2019 on a test basis, consists of our “shift intermediation” functionality, which is designed to enable our WSE shift workers to receive information regarding and to accept available shift work opportunities. The intermediation functionality becomes useful only to the extent that we have meaningful numbers of available workers and client shift opportunities in the same geographic region. We reached geographical concentration in Southern California during 2019 and we activated these key features in August 2019 to a limited group of customers on a test basis.

Our goal is to have a mature and robust hosted cloud based HRIS platform coupled with a seamless and technically sophisticated mobile phone application (“App”) that will act as both a revenue generation system as well as a “viral” customer acquisition engine through the combination of the scheduling, delivery, and intermediation features and interactions. We believe that once a critical mass of clients and WSEs is achieved, additional shift opportunities will be created pulling in additional WSEs and additional client businesses in food service and hospitality industries. Our approach to achieving this critical mass is to market our services to restaurant owners and franchisees, focusing on specific brands and geographical locations. We expect critical mass to be a function of both geography, such as in Southern California for viral adoption by WSEs and clients, or by adoption within franchise brands for viral adoption by clients.

Markets and Marketing

Our initial market focus was chosen based on our understanding of the issues and challenges facing “Quick Service Restaurants” (“QSRs”), including fast food franchises and local restaurants. We have chosen to invest in two key features of our mobile application to this end consisting of: i) scheduling functionality, designed to enhance the client’s experience through scheduling of employees and reducing the impact of turnover and ii) delivery functionality, designed to increase revenues through delivery fulfillment as well as to bring “in house” the delivery fulfillment and thereby reducing delivery costs.

One of the most recent developments in the food and hospitality industry is the rapid rise of third-party restaurant delivery providers such as Uber Eats, GrubHub, and DoorDash. These providers have successfully increased QSR revenue in many local markets by providing food delivery to a wide-scale audience using contract delivery drivers. We have observed two significant issues with our clients and third-party delivery providers which is increasingly being reported in the news media with companies like Dominos Pizza and Jimmy Johns franchises providing their own delivery services and avoiding third party delivery services. The first issue is the very large revenue share typically being paid to many of these third-party delivery providers as delivery fees. These additional costs erode the profit for the QSRs from those additional sales made through this delivery channel. The second is that our QSR customers have encountered problematic deliveries of their food products - late deliveries, cold food, missing accessories, and unfriendly delivery people. This in turn has caused significant “brand erosion” in many cases and has caused these clients to reconsider third-party delivery. | Figure 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------


We provide a solution to the third-party delivery issues. We designed our HRIS platform to manage food deliveries by the QSRs using internal personnel and a customized “white label” smart phone App. Our recently released delivery feature links this “white label” delivery ordering system to our delivery solution, thereby freeing the QSR to have their own brand showcasing an ordering APP but retaining similar back-office delivery technology including scheduling, ordering, and delivery status pushed to a customer’s smart phone. Our technology and approach to human capital management allows the company a unique window into the daily demands of QSR operators and the ability to extend our technology and engagement to enable this unique self-delivery proposition. ShiftPixy’s new driver management layer for operators in the ShiftPixy ecosystem will now allow clients to use their own team members to deliver a brand intended customer experience. ShiftPixy’s mobile platform now provides the HR compliance, management and insurance solutions necessary to the support of a delivery option and created a turnkey self-delivery opportunity for the individual QSR operator. Our solution saves delivery costs to the QSR client and allows them to retain the customer information and quality control over the food delivery.

The first phase of this component of our platform is the driver onboarding, which was completed in 2019. The enhanced features will also “micro meter” the essential commercial insurance coverages required by our operator clients on a delivery-by-delivery basis (workers’ compensation and auto coverages) which has been a significant barrier for some QSRs to provide their own delivery services. We began using the “delivery features” of our mobile platform for selected customers on a trial basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and expect to fully deploy the solution in fiscal 2020.

A significant problem for small businesses and in particular businesses in the food service industry such as QSRs, involve compliance with employment related regulations imposed by federal, state and local governments. Requirements associated with workers’ compensation insurance, and other traditional employment compliance issues, including the employer mandate provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) create compliance challenges and increased costs. The compliance challenges are often complicated by “workaround” solutions that many employers resort to in order to avoid characterizing employees as “full-time” and which in turn requires increased compliance to avoid fines and penalties. To date, the U.S. Congress has considered but not passed an amendment to replace the ACA other than the removal of the individual mandate provision in 2017. Despite the removal of the individual mandate, employers still face regulatory issues and overhead costs for which we believe our services are a cost-effective solution. 

Other regulation is prevalent at the State and Local levels. Recently in California, where most of our worksite employees reside, legislation was passed that more clearly defines “Gig” workers for companies such as Lyft or Uber as employees rather than their previous classification as independent contractors. We believe that legislation such as this is a direct response to a considerable loss of tax revenue from the “Gig” companies’ contract employees, and that there is an increasing likelihood that workers in other states will have to be treated as employees within the next few years. The effective date for the California legislation is January 2020, although both Lyft and Uber are aggressively filing appeals to avoid these reclassifications. By comparison, we have designed our HRIS platform solution to classify our WSEs as employees and thereby be well positioned to provide HR services for companies that are impacted by the change from independent contractors to employees. 

Figure 4



The worldwide trend toward a Gig Economy resulting from the market adoption of smart phones and mobile telephones and remote office workers moving away from the traditional 9 to 5 office or factory workplace. For our target worksite employee audience, as of February 2019, over 92% of 18-30-year-old workers have, or use, a “smart” mobile telephone. This development has created opportunities for companies catering to the use of these devices. We have designed our mobile application (“App”) to utilize the mobile smart phone adoption to create an easy to use on-boarding tool for potential employees. The migration towards a Gig Economy trend is also significant and according to a 2016 study conducted by Ardent partners, nearly 42% of the world’s total workforce is now considered ‘non-employee,’ which includes contingent/contract workers, temporary staff, gig workers, freelancers, professional services, and independent contractors. (Ardent Partners Ltd. “The State of Contingent Workforce Management 2016-2017: Adapting to a New World of Work.” October 2016). Our initial focus in the marketing of our product to the larger Gig Economy is to small and medium sized businesses with high worker turnover such as the restaurant and hospitality industries who have high turnover and often contract with independent contractor workers to perform less than full-time gig engagements, primarily in the form of shift work.

We are also joining the hot topic dialogue currently going on in the nextGEN Gig Economy about companies such as Uber and others and we see a potential new market based upon the issue of worker misclassification in the Gig Economy. Gig Economy companies such as Uber may typically classify the people working for them as “independent contractors” rather than “employees” for jobs (gigs). The companies can pay much less for services and in regulatory requirements if their workers are classified as independent contractors. Under state and federal employment laws, workers classified as employees are much more expensive for these companies. However, increasing legal and regulatory pressure against Uber and others has increased awareness about this issue. Most recently, in the State of California, legislation has passed that would require Uber, Lyft, and other shift companies to convert their previously classified independent contractors to employee status. ShiftPixy management foresaw this regulatory change and provides a solution by absorbing workers for these types of Gig Economy companies as employees of ShiftPixy, eliminating any risk of litigation, fines and other worker misclassification problems for these types of Gig Economy companies to the extent they become ShiftPixy clients.

ShiftPixy’s headquarters is currently situated in Irvine, California, from which it can reach the Southern California market and has a geographical presence via sales offices in New York, Austin, Texas, Chicago and the Orlando area from which its local sales/services representatives will secure and service clients in those areas, and it plans to open additional physical offices in San Francisco and Miami. Through these office locations, we plan to engage more actively with clients through sales, marketing, employee onboarding, training and payroll processing, in each instance as necessary and appropriate to the applicable market. These markets collectively account for or allow us to cover approximately 53% of our target market in the restaurant/hospitality sectors. (U.S. Department of Labor. Bureau of Labor Statistics. May 2015. Occupational Employment and Wages.).

We believe ShiftPixy will experience business and revenue growth in the nextGEN Gig Economy from the following factors:


· | Large Potential Market. Current statistics show that there are over 14.7 million employees working in our current target market--the restaurant and hospitality industries representing over $300 billion of annual revenues. (U.S. Department of Labor. Bureau of Labor Statistics. February 2018). Compared to the total workforce in all industries, workers in the restaurant industry have a notably higher percentage of part-time workers. (National Restaurant Association. “News & Research: Restaurant middle class job growth 4x stronger than overall economy.” 13 January 2016). At our current monetization rate per employee, this represents an annual revenue opportunity of over $9 billion per year for the United States. Our current geographic presence in California, New York City and parts of Texas, Illinois, and Florida provides coverage of over 50% of this opportunity. Our intention is to expand both our geographic footprint and our service offerings into other industries, particularly where part-time work is a significant component of the applicable labor force, including the retail and health care sectors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Rapid Rise of Independent Workers. The number of independent workers, totaling approximately 41 million in 2018, is expected to increase to 40% of the private, non-farm U.S. workforce by 2021. (MBO Partners. “America’s Independents / A Rising Economic Force / 2016 State of Independence in America Report / Sixth Annual.” 2016.). As of early 2019, approximately 48% of the U.S. workforce has worked as an independent employee as either part time or on a contract basis (Source: http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence). 
· | Technology Affecting and Attitudes towards Employment Related Engagements. Gig-economy platforms have changed the way part-time workers can identify and connect to work opportunities, and Millennials and others have embraced such technologies as a means to secure short-term employment related engagements. The significant increase in the adoption of smart phone devices has provided the “last mile” platform to enable technology solutions such as ours to provide a gig economy platform. Most importantly, for our target audience of 18-35 year old workers as of February 2019, 92% of these workers regularly use a smart phone (Source: Pew Research Center). 


· | New ShiftPixy Mobile App is Designed to Provide Additional Benefits to Employers and NextGen Shift Workers. Millennials represent approximately 40% of the independent workforce who are over the age of 21 and who work 15 hours or more each week. (MBO Partners. “America’s Independents / A Rising Economic Force / 2016 State of Independence in America Report / Sixth Annual.” 2016.) Mindful that most of its shifters will be Millennials who connect with the outside world primarily through a mobile device, ShiftPixy is poised to significantly expand its business through the ShiftPixy mobile app. The ShiftPixy mobile app is a proprietary application downloaded to mobile devices, allowing ShiftPixy’s shifters to access shift work opportunities at all of ShiftPixy’s clients, not just their current restaurant or hospitality provider, and with an added feature, anticipated to be available in the first calendar quarter of 2020, also allowing shift employees not working at its clients to access shift work opportunities at all of its clients.

The ShiftPixy Ecosystem Solution: ShiftPixy has developed an HRIS Ecosystem comprised of a closed proprietary operating and processing information system that provides a tool for businesses needing staffing flexibility to schedule existing employees and to post open schedule slots to be filled by an available pool of shift workers. The ShiftPixy Ecosystem provides the following benefits to our clients:

1. | Compliance: ShiftPixy assumes a substantial portion of a business’s employment regulatory compliance issues by having all of client shifter employees become employees of ShiftPixy. As the employer of the WSEs, ShiftPixy can assist its clients with the staffing of their shift employee requirements by providing a qualified pool of potential applicants or as shift workers. The individual WSE is a legal employee of ShiftPixy and ShiftPixy thereby provides employment regulatory compliance reporting, taking this burden away from the ShiftPixy client. The client’s management time spent on compliance issues substantially reduced and allows client management to focus on their business. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Operational improvements: Our service can reduce the impact of high turnover, which is a consistent problem across the restaurant industry and a significant issue to our clients. Our service provides pre-screened applicants for permanent positions as well as the access to the ShiftPixy Ecosystem population of potential shift workers. The flexibility inherent in the Ecosystem approach can better tailor the staffing needs of a client to the talent pool available. 
3. | Cost Savings: The payroll and related costs associated WSEs such as workers compensation and benefits are consolidated and charged, in effect, in conjunction with the shifters’ applicable rates of pay, allowing the clients to fund the employment related costs as the services are used--thereby avoiding various lump sum employment-related cost impositions. Cost savings for our clients can be varied but in general we see cost reductions in reduced overhead costs related to HR compliance, payroll processing, and elimination of non-compliance fines and related penalties. We also see a reduction in the impact of high turnover and the related costs of that high turnover. ShiftPixy is able to use economies of scale in purchasing employer related solutions such as workers’ compensation and other benefits and in general can provide a shift worker to a business at a lower cost than the business can otherwise typically staff a particular position.
4. | Improved human resources management: By having access to ShiftPixy’s entire part-time workforce, a client business is enabled to scale up or down more rapidly, making it easier to contain and manage operational costs. The two largest costs for a restaurant are food and labor. (National Restaurant Association “Restaurant Operations Report 2013-2014.) ShiftPixy charges a fixed percentage on wages that allows the client business to budget and plan more effectively without the full weight associated with the threats of penalties or missteps in dealing with employment law compliance related issues. 


ShiftPixy and its subsidiary collectively serve, as of August 31, 2019 an aggregate of 246 clients, with an aggregate of approximately 13,000 employees. None of these clients represents more than 10% of our revenues for fiscal year 2019.

Competition

We see two primary sources of competition with no one competitor addressing both. Competitors to our “gig” business model include businesses such as ShiftGig, Instawork, Snag, Jobletics and other comparable businesses that seek to arrange short-term work assignments for both employees and independent contractors. Competitors to our HRIS Ecosystem, which encompasses on a broad scale, the assignment of a workforce to businesses on a long-term basis, include businesses such as Insperity, TriNet Group, and Just Works, and the assignment of individual workers to businesses generally on a short-term basis include businesses such as Kelly Services, ManpowerGroup, and Barrett Business Services.

We believe our service offering competes effectively based on our strategy of combining an Ecosystem of employment services with the individualized ability to link trained workers to specific shift work opportunities.

Governmental Regulation

Our business operates in an environment that is affected by numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to labor and employment matters, benefit plans and income and employment taxes. Moreover, because our client engagements involve some form of co-employer relationship with regard to the employees who provide services in employment to our clients, the application of such laws to these non-traditional employer relationships can become complex. Nearly all states have adopted laws or regulations regarding the licensure, registration or certifications of organizations that engage in co-employer relationships. While our model is currently not included in such regulations, we may become subject to such laws and regulations when we enter into co-employer relationships with regard to employees providing services in the jurisdictions where such laws and regulations apply.

The following summarizes what we believe are the most important legal and regulatory aspects of our business:

Federal Regulations

Employer Status

We sponsor certain employee benefit plan offerings as the “employer” of our shift workers under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and ERISA. The multiple definitions of “employer” under both the Code and ERISA are not clear and most are defined in part by complex multi-factor tests under common law. We believe that we qualify as an “employer” of our shift workers under both the Code and ERISA, as well as various state regulations, but this status could be subject to challenge by various regulators. For additional information on employer status and its impact on our business and results of operations, refer to Item 1A of this Form 10-K, under the heading, “If ShiftPixy is not recognized as an employer of worksite employees under federal and state regulations, or we are deemed to be an insurance agent or third-party administrator, we and our clients could be adversely impacted.”
Affordable Care Act and Health Care Reform

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) was signed into law in March 2010. The ACA implemented substantial health care reforms with staggered effective dates continuing through 2020, and many provisions in the Act require the issuance of additional guidance from applicable federal government agencies and the states. There could be significant changes to the ACA and health care in general, including the potential modification, amendment or repeal of the ACA. For additional information on the ACA and its impact on our business and results of operations, refer to Item 1A of this Form 10-K, under the heading, “Failure to comply with, or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our business, particularly potential changes to the ACA, could have a materially adverse effect on our marketing plan as well as our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.” As of the date of this filing, the ACA has not been formally amended or repealed; however, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 effectively eliminates the individual mandate provisions of the ACA, beginning in 2019.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

Maintaining the security of information regarding our employees is important to us as we sponsor employee benefit plans and may have access to personal health information of our employees. The manner in which we manage protected health information (PHI) is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH Act). HIPAA contains substantial restrictions and health data privacy, security and breach notification requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of PHI. Further, under the HITECH Act there are steep penalties and fines for HIPAA violations. Our health plans are covered entities under HIPAA, and we are therefore required to comply with HIPAA’s portability, privacy, and security requirements. For additional information regarding the information we collect, how we maintain the confidentiality of our clients’ and employees’ confidential information and the potential impact to our business if we fail to protect the confidentiality of such data, refer to Item 1A of this Form 10-K, under the heading, “We host, collect, use, transmit and store personal and business information, and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.”
State Regulations

Nearly all states have adopted provisions for licensing, registration, certification or other formal recognition of co-employers. Such laws vary from state to state but generally provide for monitoring or ensuring the fiscal responsibility of a professional employer organization, and in some cases codify and clarify the co-employment relationship for unemployment, workers’ compensation and other purposes under state laws. The scope of the laws and regulations of states is such that it encompasses the activities of ShiftPixy, Inc., as well as its subsidiary, ShiftableHR. In addition, many state laws require guarantees by ShiftPixy, Inc. of the activities of its subsidiary, ShiftableHR, and in some states we may seek licensure, registration or certification, as applicable, of ShiftPixy, Inc., with its subsidiary, ShiftableHR, because the financials for both organizations are consolidated. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements in the states wherein we are conducting business.

We must also comply with state unemployment tax requirements where our clients are located. State unemployment taxes are based on taxable wages and tax rates assigned by each state. The tax rates vary by state and are determined, in part, based on our prior years’ compensation and unemployment claims experience in each state. Certain rates are also determined, in part, by each client’s own compensation and unemployment claims experience. In addition, states have the ability under law to increase unemployment tax rates, including retroactively, to cover deficiencies in the unemployment tax funds.
