​
Business Organization
​
In 2022, the Company continued to evolve its organizational design to meet the growing needs of the business and product offerings and align with the strategy discussed above. Our organization is managed from a sales perspective based on “go-to-market” sales channels, emphasizing shared learning across end-user applications and common supplier/vendor relationships. These sales channels are structured to serve a range of customers for our products and services. As a result of this structure, we concluded that we have one operating and reportable segment — the design, development and sale of green hydrogen products and solutions that help customers meet their business goals while decarbonizing their operations. Our chief executive officer was identified as the chief operating decision maker (CODM). All significant operating decisions made by management are largely based upon the analysis of Plug on a total company basis, including assessments related to our incentive compensation plans. The current organizational structure is designed to help Plug achieve its goals and establish Plug as a world leader in green hydrogen solutions.
​
Products and Services
​
Plug is facilitating the paradigm shift to an increasingly electrified world by innovating cutting-edge hydrogen and fuel cell solutions. 
​
While we continue to develop commercially viable hydrogen and fuel cell product solutions, we have expanded our offerings to support a variety of commercial operations that can be powered with green hydrogen. We provide electrolyzers that allow customers — such as refineries, producers of chemicals, steel, fertilizer and commercial refueling stations — to generate hydrogen on-site. We are focusing our efforts on (a) industrial mobility applications, including electric forklifts and electric industrial vehicles, at multi-shift high volume manufacturing and high throughput distribution sites where we believe our products and services provide a unique combination of productivity, flexibility, and environmental benefits; (b) stationary power systems that will support critical operations, such as data centers, microgrids, and generation facilities, in either a backup power or continuous power role and replace batteries, diesel generators or the grid for telecommunication logistics, transportation, and utility customers; and (c) production of hydrogen. Plug expects to support these products and customers with an ecosystem of vertically integrated products that produce, transport, store and handle, dispense, and use hydrogen for mobility and power applications. 
​

​
Liquefaction Systems: Plug’s 15 ton-per-day and 30 ton-per-day liquefiers are engineered for high efficiency, reliability, and operational flexibility — providing consistent liquid hydrogen to customers. This design increases plant reliability and availability while minimizing parasitic losses like heat leak and seal gas losses. 
​
Cryogenic Equipment: Engineered equipment including trailers and mobile storage equipment for the distribution of liquified hydrogen, oxygen, argon, nitrogen and other cryogenic gases.
​
We provide our products and solutions worldwide through our direct sales force, and by leveraging relationships with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and their dealer networks. Plug is currently targeting Asia, Australia, Europe, Middle East and North America for expansion in adoption. The European Union (the “EU”) has rolled out ambitious targets for the hydrogen economy as part of the EU strategy for energy integration and Plug is seeking to execute on our strategy to become one of the European leaders in the hydrogen economy. This includes a targeted account strategy for material handling, securing strategic partnerships with European OEMs, energy companies, utility leaders and accelerating its electrolyzer business. Our global strategy includes leveraging a network of integrators or contract manufacturers. 
Part of our long-term plan includes Plug penetrating the European and Asian hydrogen market, on-road vehicle market, and large-scale stationary market. Plug’s formation of joint ventures with HyVia and AccionaPlug S.L. in Europe and SK Plug Hyverse Co., Ltd. (“SK Plug Hyverse”), in Asia not only support this goal but are expected to provide us with a more global footprint. Plug has been successful with acquisitions, strategic partnerships and joint ventures, and we plan to continue this mix.
​
We manufacture our commercially viable products in Latham, New York, Rochester, New York, Slingerlands, New York, Houston, Texas, Lafayette, Indiana, and Spokane, Washington, and support liquid hydrogen production and logistics in Charleston, Tennessee and Kingsland, Georgia.
​

​
Working Capital Items
​
We currently maintain inventory levels adequate for our short-term needs based upon present levels of production and for the purposes of global supply chain risk management. We consider the component parts of our different products to be generally available and current suppliers to be reliable and capable of satisfying anticipated needs. However, we have seen shortages of materials needed to produce fuel cell and hydrogen generation equipment components due to constraints in the production of global semiconductors, MEA components, and due to general supplier performance related to the COVID-19 pandemic, labor shortages, increasing energy prices, supply chain constraints and logistical challenges. These material shortages have also negatively impacted the pricing of materials and components sourced or used by the Company.
​
Distribution, Marketing and Strategic Relationships
​
We have developed strategic relationships with established companies in key areas including distribution, service, marketing, supply, technology development and product development. We sell our products worldwide, with a primary focus on North America, Europe, and Asia, through our direct product sales force, OEMs, and their dealer networks. We operate in Europe under the name Plug Power Europe to develop and sell hydrogen fuel cell systems for the European material handling market.
​
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Plug Power LA JV, LLC, created a joint venture with Niloco Hydrogen Holdings LLC, named “Hidrogenii” in the third quarter of 2022. We believe Hidrogenii will support reliability of supply and speed to market for hydrogen throughout North America, and set the foundation for broader collaboration between Plug and Olin. Hidrogenii plans to begin with the construction of a 15-ton-per-day hydrogen plant in St. Gabriel, Louisiana. Hidrogenii is owned 50% by Plug Power LA JV, LLC and 50% by Niloco Hydrogen Holdings LLC.
​

​
In addition, Plug’s acquisitions over the last several years are enhancing Plug’s position in the hydrogen industry, complementing the Company’s industry-leading position in the design, construction, and operation of customer-facing hydrogen fueling stations. These acquisitions are expected to further establish a pathway for Plug to transition from low-carbon to zero-carbon hydrogen solutions.
​
Competition
​
We experience competition in all areas of our business. The markets we address for motive and backup power are characterized by the presence of well-established battery and combustion generator products. We also face competition from integrated gas companies, and companies offering Steam Methane Reformers and electrolyzers. We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include product features, including size and weight, relative price and performance, lifetime operating cost, including any maintenance and support, product quality and 

10




reliability, safety, ease of use, foot print, rapid integration with existing equipment and processes, customer support design innovation, marketing and distribution capability, and service and support and corporate reputation.
​
Intellectual Property 
​
We believe that neither we nor our competitors can achieve a significant proprietary position on the basic technologies currently used in PEM fuel cell systems. However, we believe the design and integration of our system and system components, as well as some of the low-cost manufacturing processes that we have developed, are intellectual property that can be protected. Our intellectual property portfolio covers, among other things: fuel cell components that reduce manufacturing part count; fuel cell system designs that lend themselves to mass manufacturing; improvements to fuel cell system efficiency, reliability and system life; and control strategies, such as added safety protections and operation under extreme conditions. In general, our employees are party to agreements providing that all inventions, whether patented or not, made or conceived while being our employee, which are related to or result from work or research that we perform, will remain our sole and exclusive property.
​
We have a total of 65 issued patents currently active with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), expiring between 2023 and 2040. At the close of 2022, we had 23 U.S. patent applications pending. Additionally, we have 22 trademarks registered with the USPTO expiring between 2023 and 2032, and three trademark applications pending.
​
Government Regulation
​
Our fuel cell, electrolyzer, and hydrogen products, their installations, and the operations at our facilities are subject to oversight and regulation at the international level, as well as federal, state, and local levels in accordance with statutes and ordinances relating to, among others, building codes, fire codes, public safety, electrical and gas pipeline connections and hydrogen siting. The level of regulation may depend, in part, upon where a system is located — both domestically and abroad. 
​
In addition, product safety standards have been established by the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”), covering the overall fuel cell system. The class 1, 2, and 3 GenDrive products are designed with the intent of meeting the requirements of UL 2267 “Fuel Cell Power Systems for Installation in Industrial Electric Trucks” and NFPA 505 “Fire Safety Standard for Powered Industrial Trucks.” The hydrogen tanks used in these systems have been either certified to ANSI/CSA NGV2-2007 “Compressed Natural Gas Vehicle Fuel Containers” or ISO/TS 15869 “Gaseous hydrogen and hydrogen blends—Land vehicle fuel tanks.” We will continue to design our GenDrive products to meet ANSI and/or other applicable standards. We certified several models of Class 1, 2, and 3 GenDrive products to the requirements of the CE mark with guidance from a European certified body. The hydrogen tanks used in these systems are certified to the Pressure Equipment Directive by a European certified body. The GenFuel hydrogen storage and dispensing products are designed with the intent of meeting the requirements of NFPA 2 “Hydrogen Technologies Code.” We are also subject to standards as applied to the design of our electrolyzer products, both domestically and abroad. Such standards include, but are not limited to, “Hydrogen Generators Using Water Electrolysis” (ISO 22734), “Hydrogen Technologies Code” (NFPA 2), “Explosive Atmospheres” requirements (UL 60079), CE product standards within the European Commission, and AS/NZS standards for our products within each jurisdiction, as applicable. As our Company increasingly expands to new markets and jurisdiction, we also become currently subject to new and different regulations in such jurisdictions. 
​
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and non-U.S. environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the use, handling, storage, transportation, disposal and human exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, product safety, and emissions of pollution into the environment, and the remediation of contamination. Our facilities in the United States are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), which regulates the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local residents. We are also subject to occupational safety regulations in other countries. In addition, certain environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can significantly increase the costs of our operations. Violations of environmental laws and regulations can subject us to additional costs and expenses, including defense costs and expenses and civil and 

11




criminal penalties. Environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and compliance costs are significant and will continue to be significant in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that existing or future environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our business. 
​
As our business expands — particularly as part of our green hydrogen production strategy — we will continue to evaluate the potential impact such provisions will have on our business, as applied to each relevant jurisdiction in which we conduct business. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets that we serve, or on our results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. However, there is no guarantee that any such legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords will be favorable to our business. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.
​
Other than these requirements, at this time we do not know what additional requirements, if any, each jurisdiction will impose on our products or their installation. We also do not know the extent to which any new regulations may impact our ability to distribute, install, and service our products. As we continue distributing our systems to our target markets, the federal, state, local, or foreign government entities may seek to impose regulations or competitors may seek to influence regulations through lobbying efforts.
​
See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a description of these governmental regulations and other material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position. 
​
Raw Materials and Suppliers 
​
Most components essential to our business are generally available from multiple sources. We believe there are component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to us could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition. We are mitigating these potential risks by introducing alternate system architectures which we expect will allow us to diversify our supply chain with multiple fuel cell, electrolyzer stack and air supply component vendors. We are also working closely with these vendors and other key suppliers on coordinated product introduction plans, strategic inventories, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. Recent cost pressures from global energy prices and inflation have negatively impacted access to our key raw materials. In cases where we have single sourced suppliers (typically due to new technology and products), we engineer or develop new supply sources while covering short- and medium-term risks with supply contracts, inventory, and development partnerships. 
​
Additionally, in January 2023, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with Johnson Matthey Hydrogen Technologies Limited, a subsidiary of Johnson Matthey PLC and a global leader in sustainable technologies (“JM”), pursuant to which JM will supply the Company catalyst coated membrane (CCM) for use in the production of fuel cells as well as catalysts and membranes for use in the production of electrolyzers. In addition, the Company and JM intend to develop their existing and new technology and commercial products and co-invest in a manufacturing facility in the United States.
​
Research and Development 
​
Because the fuel cell industry is still in the early state of adoption, our ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. We continue to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of cost, size, weight, and in supporting service solutions in order to drive further commercialization.
​
We may also expand the range of our product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. Our research and development expense totaled $99.6 million, $64.8 million, and $27.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
​
Human Capital Resources
​
As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,353 employees, of which 156 are temporary employees, with 2,941 located in the United States and 412 located outside of the United States. In order to facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Plug a safe, rewarding, and challenging workplace with competitive salaries.

​
Additionally, we work specifically with veteran recruitment firms and are proud of our efforts to hire those who have served and continue to serve in the armed forces. As of December 31, 2022, we had a 290 person veteran workforce.
​
Engagement
​
We believe that listening to our employees is key to providing a work environment that is inclusive and results in a motivated and engaged workforce. We regularly conduct anonymous employee surveys to understand where we have opportunities to improve and solicit ideas from employees. Several initiatives have been launched, such as focus groups with Human Resources and leadership and hiring an employee engagement and inclusion manager to focus on these efforts. 

13




We conduct regular employee engagement surveys to measure progress and satisfaction with a range of initiatives. In our most recent survey in August 2022, employees indicated they would recommend Plug as a great place to work and they are happy working at Plug. The insights from the most recent survey allowed us to review employee feedback at each function and Business Unit level to drive impactful action, including developing specific training programs to improve and enhance technical processes and increasing team collaboration and effectively using meeting time to foster focus and clarity. Plug’s top strengths were prospects, purpose, and authenticity. Employees indicated they were excited about Plug’s future; they believe they are doing meaningful work at Plug and feel comfortable being themselves at work.
​
We also believe that transparency and communication are key elements of the Company’s culture. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a weekly all employee meeting led by our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President of Human Resources provide information on safety measures as relates to the Company’s practice on COVID-19. The meeting also includes a timely business topic delivered by a subject matter expert within the Company. This provides timely information and opportunities for upcoming leaders to develop their presentation skills, and aims to align the workforce with the Company’s vision, strategy, and objectives. An open question and answer session is hosted as part of the weekly employee meeting by the Chief Executive Officer, in which employees are encouraged to submit questions and can do so anonymously if they prefer.
​
Community Involvement
​
We recognize the importance of supporting our local communities as we continue to grow as an organization. Our efforts not only provide value back to our community members but enables our employees to give back, helping them to meet their own values. We also facilitate employee donations through the United Way, supporting its four pillar objectives helping our communities, which includes the (1) ability to meet basic needs, (2) education leading to a good job, (3) income providing financial security, and (4) an ability to gain and maintain health. This system enables our employees to donate money to causes they care about in their individual communities through payroll deductions.
​
Additionally, in 2022, we launched a global volunteer time off policy to support activities that serve the communities in which we live and work in ways that are meaningful, impactful, and help those in need. Plug recognizes that participating in philanthropic activities enriches the lives of its employees and its communities.
​
Performance Management and Incentives
​
Our full-year performance management process begins with setting annual goals for the Company, which guide the development of functional and individual employee goals. Employees and their managers are accountable for goals and must review performance against the goals on an ongoing basis. We provide employee base wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, and location. Additionally, we believe that individual performance and the results of the Company are directly linked to payment of annual short-term incentive compensation. Employees may also be granted equity compensation awards with multi-year vesting for retention.

Talent
​
Our talent strategy is a balance of attracting external talent, combined with an internal mobility practice that encourages career growth and opportunity to progress within Plug. We leverage both internal and external recruitment resources and incentivize our current employees to refer talent they recommend as future employees of Plug. Enculturation of new hires begins immediately upon acceptance of an offer from Plug by leveraging technology to introduce them to the organization and their teams. A new hire onboarding program is delivered bi-weekly to continue the assimilation process and ensure that the workforce is prepared to succeed in their new career endeavor. 
​
Plug values the unique skills and competencies of our diverse workforce. A key component to planning for individual career growth aligned with organizational growth is learning and development. We offer the entire workforce a subscription to on-line learning that includes thousands of professionally created on-demand webinars and podcasts. Additionally, we have offered remote led leadership training throughout the COVID-19 pandemic with plans to continue in this new remote and hybrid environment. We also offer a tuition reimbursement program, where employees are provided support for continuing their education. On the job training, combined with face-to-face and remote skill training are utilized in many functions, as well as virtual reality skill training to ensure that skills are refreshed regularly. We use a comprehensive training matrix in certain areas and web-based learning to make sure we meet both regulatory requirements

and our own standards. Besides job-specific safety training, we offer personal-development training on many topics, including sustainability and wellness. 
​
Additional development opportunities include opportunities to participate in employee led groups that develop leadership and project management capabilities while contributing to our purpose and mission. On-line participation in internally developed business-related courses called Plugology is encouraged for all employees and helps newly hired employees assimilate to the business.

Compensation and Benefits
​
As part of our commitment to our people, Plug offers employees competitive benefits, including health, vision, and dental plans, flexible spending accounts, comprehensive life insurance (including company provided life insurance), and disability coverage. Additionally, employees are offered a vacation and holiday package, an employee referral bonus program, educational assistance, and volunteer time. We also offer a comprehensive wellness program that is designed to promote long-term healthy, active lifestyles and our Fitness Reimbursement Program provides up to $1,200 per year to accommodate employees’ wellness activities. In 2022, we also launched a paid parental leave policy to aid in bonding time for new parents. At Plug, 92.9% of our employees participate in our comprehensive 401(k) package that includes a 401(k)-retirement savings plan, which offers up to a 5% match in Plug stock. To encourage savings, we auto-enroll all employees in the plan after 60 days of employment. Our portfolio reflects our values with increased priority given to socially responsible investing — the plan’s diversified investment options include two socially responsible funds.
 ​
Additionally, we have an internal Step Pay Program which provides our Field Service Technicians an outlined career path of training for eight separate levels to grow their skills and compensation.

The Company believes that identifying and developing the next generation of business leaders is important to its long-term success and is proud to support employees in furthering their education with tuition reimbursement plans and training.

COVID-19 Health Measures
​
While we no longer enforce our prior COVID-19 policies with respect to weekly COVID-19 testing, face coverings, or daily COVID-19 questionnaires, we continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and emerging variants and remain prepared to adjust our policies and safety protocols in line with guidance from state and federal agencies. Employees are still expected to remain home if they are not feeling well and should contact our COVID team for future guidance. Furthermore, we have resumed all commercial air travel and all other non-critical travel, while also allowing employees to resume their personal travel. We have enabled third-party access to our facilities and are continuing our normal janitorial and sanitary procedures. We are no longer requiring staggered shifts in our manufacturing facilities and are offering hybrid work schedules to those whose job function enabled them to do so. 
​
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant transportation challenges for global suppliers and we expect that these challenges will continue to have an impact on our businesses for the foreseeable future. We continue to take proactive steps to limit the impact of these challenges and are working closely with our suppliers and transportation vendors to ensure availability of products and implement other cost savings initiatives. In addition, we continue to invest in our supply chain to improve its resilience with a focus on automation, dual sourcing of critical components and localized manufacturing when feasible. To date, there has been limited disruption to the availability of our products related to COVID-19, though it is possible that more significant disruptions could occur if these supply chain challenges continue.
