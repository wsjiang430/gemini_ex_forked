Item 1. Business
 
First Defiance Financial Corp. (“First Defiance” or “the Company”) is a unitary thrift holding company that, through its subsidiaries, First Federal Bank of the Midwest (“First Federal” or “the Bank”), First Insurance Group of the Midwest, Inc. (“First Insurance”), and First Defiance Risk Management Inc. (collectively, “the Subsidiaries”), focuses on traditional banking and property, casualty, life and group health insurance products.
 
The Company’s philosophy is to grow and prosper, building long-term relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards, and safe and sound assets. The Company operates as a locally- oriented, community-based financial services organization, augmented by experienced, centralized support in select critical areas. The Company’s local market orientation is reflected in its market area management and local advisory boards, which are comprised of local business persons, professionals and other community representatives that assist area management in responding to local banking needs.
 
The Company’s operating objectives include expansion, diversification within its markets, growth of its fee-based income, and growth organically and through acquisitions of financial institutions, branches and financial services businesses. The Company seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar, have experienced management and possess either significant market area presence or have the potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale and expanded services. The Company regularly evaluates merger and acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of premiums over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of the Company’s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in any future transaction.
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company had consolidated assets of $3.2 billion, consolidated deposits of $2.6 billion, and consolidated stockholders’ equity of $399.6 million. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in June of 1995. Its principal executive offices are located at 601 Clinton Street, Defiance, Ohio 43512, and its telephone number is (419) 782-5015.
 
On June 22, 2018, the Company announced a stock split in the form of a share distribution of two common shares for each outstanding common share. The stock split was distributed on July 12, 2018, to shareholders of record as of July 2, 2018. All share and per share data in this Form 10-K have been adjusted and are reflective of the stock split.
 
First Defiance's website, www.fdef.com, contains a hyperlink under the Investor Relations section to EDGAR, where the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after First Defiance has filed the report with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 
The Subsidiaries
 
The Company’s core business operations are conducted through its subsidiaries:
 
First Federal Bank of the Midwest: First Federal is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Defiance, Ohio. It conducts operations through thirty-six full-service banking center offices in Allen, Defiance, Fulton, Hancock, Henry, Lucas, Marion, Ottawa, Paulding, Putnam, Seneca, Williams, Wood, and Wyandot counties in northwest and central Ohio, three full-service banking center offices in Allen County in northeast Indiana, five full-service banking center offices in Lenawee County in southeast Michigan and one commercial loan production office in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that was opened late in the fourth quarter of 2017.

First Federal is primarily engaged in community banking. It attracts deposits from the general public through its offices and website, and uses those and other available sources of funds to originate residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial loans, home improvement and home equity loans and consumer loans. In addition, First Federal invests in U.S. Treasury and federal government agency obligations, obligations of the State of Ohio and its political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities that are issued by federal agencies, including real estate mortgage investment conduits (“REMICs”) and residential collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”), and corporate bonds. First Federal’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). First Federal is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) System.
 
First Insurance Group of the Midwest: First Insurance is a wholly owned subsidiary of First Defiance. First Insurance is an insurance agency that conducts business throughout First Federal’s Markets. The Maumee and Oregon, Ohio, offices were consolidated into a new office in Sylvania, Ohio, in January 2018. First Insurance offers property and casualty insurance, life insurance and group health insurance.
First Defiance Risk Management: First Defiance Risk Management was incorporated on December 20, 2012, as a wholly-owned insurance company subsidiary of the Company to insure the Company and its subsidiaries against certain risks unique to the operations of the Company and for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today’s insurance marketplace. First Defiance Risk Management pools resources with several other similar insurance company subsidiaries of financial institutions to help minimize the risk allocable to each participating insurer.
Business Strategy
 
First Defiance’s primary objective is to be a high-performing, community-focused financial institution, well regarded in its market areas. First Defiance accomplishes this through emphasis on local decision making and empowering its employees with tools and knowledge to serve its customers’ needs. First Defiance believes in a “Customer First” philosophy that is strengthened by its Mission & Vision and Core Values initiatives. First Defiance also has a tagline of “Better Together” as an indication of its commitment to local, responsive, personalized service. First Defiance believes this strategy results in greater customer loyalty and profitability through core relationships. First Defiance is focused on diversification of revenue sources and increased market penetration in areas where the growth potential exists for a balance between acquisition and organic growth.

In the later part of 2017, the Company recognized the need to adapt its organization structure to meet certain future strategic objectives and to continue its past success. The Company believes that fully utilizing the strengths of its leadership team and a structure that supports strategic initiatives will enhance its ability to achieve even more objectives in the future. As such, the Company redefined its market areas to support strategies to enhance processes and efficiencies to support overall growth. The new structure includes three metro markets; Toledo, Ohio, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Columbus, Ohio, and two legacy markets; Southern Market Area and Northern Market Area.

Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Lending - Commercial and commercial real estate lending have been an ongoing focus and a major component of First Federal’s success. First Federal provides primarily commercial real estate and commercial business loans with an emphasis on owner- occupied commercial real estate and commercial business lending, including a focus on the deposit balances that accompany these relationships. First Federal’s client base tends to be small to middle market customers with annual gross revenues generally between $1 million and $50 million. First Federal’s focus is also on securing multiple guarantors in addition to collateral where possible. These customers require First Federal to have a high degree of knowledge and understanding of their business in order to provide them with solutions to their financial needs. First Federal’s “Customer First” philosophy and culture complements this need of its clients. First Federal believes this personal service model differentiates First Federal from its competitors, particularly the larger regional institutions. First Federal offers a wide variety of products to support commercial clients including remote deposit capture and other cash management services. First Federal also believes that the small business customer is a strong market for First Federal. First Federal participates in many of the Small Business Administration lending programs. Maintaining a diversified portfolio with an emphasis on monitoring industry concentrations and reacting to changes in the credit characteristics of industries is an ongoing focus.
Consumer Banking - First Federal offers customers a full range of deposit and investment products including demand, checking, money market, certificates of deposits, Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) and savings accounts. First Federal offers a full range of investment products through the wealth management department and a wide variety of consumer loan products, including residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and installment loans. First Federal also offers online banking services, which include mobile banking, People Pay (“P2P”), online bill pay, and online account opening as well as the MoneyPass ATM Network offering access to our customers to over 32,000 ATMs nationwide without a surcharge fee.
Fee Income Development - Generation of fee income and the diversification of revenue sources are accomplished through the mortgage banking operation, First Insurance and the wealth management department as First Defiance seeks to reduce reliance on retail transaction fee income.
Deposit Growth - First Federal’s focus has been to grow core deposits with an emphasis on total relationship banking for both our retail and commercial customers. First Federal’s pricing strategy considers the whole relationship of the customer. First Federal continues to focus on increasing its market share in the communities it serves by providing quality products with extraordinary customer service, business development strategies and branch expansion. First Federal will look to grow its footprint in areas believed to further complement its overall market share and complement its strategy of being a high-performing community bank.
Asset Quality - Maintaining a strong credit culture is of the utmost importance to First Federal. First Federal has maintained a strong credit approval and review process that has allowed the Company to maintain a credit quality standard that balances the return with the risks of industry concentrations and loan types. First Federal is primarily a collateral lender with an emphasis on cash flow performance, while obtaining additional support from personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment. First Federal has directed its attention to loan types and markets that it knows well and in which it has historically been successful. First Federal strives to have loan relationships that are well diversified in both size and industry, and monitors the overall trends in the portfolio to maintain its industry and loan type concentration targets. First Federal maintains a problem loan remediation process that focuses on detection and resolution. First Federal maintains a strong process of internal control that subjects the loan portfolio to periodic internal reviews as well as independent third-party loan review.
 
Expansion Opportunities - First Defiance believes it is well positioned to take advantage of acquisitions or other business opportunities in its market areas. First Defiance believes it has a track record of successfully accomplishing both acquisitions and de novo branching in its market area. This track record puts the Company in a solid position to enter or expand its business. First Defiance will continue to be disciplined as well as opportunistic in its approach to future acquisitions and de novo branching with a focus on its primary geographic market area, which it knows well, and has been competing in for a long period of time, as well as surrounding market areas.

First Defiance’s investment portfolio includes 86 CMO issues totaling $101.5 million, all of which are fully amortizing securities. Management does not believe the risks associated with any of its CMO investments are significantly different from risks associated with other pass-through mortgage-backed securities. First Defiance did not have any off-balance sheet derivative securities at December 31, 2018.
 
First Defiance’s securities portfolio is classified as either “available-for-sale” or “held-to-maturity.”  Securities classified as “available-for-sale” may be sold prior to maturity due to changes in interest rates, prepayment risks, and availability of alternative investments, or to meet the Company’s liquidity needs.
 
The carrying value of securities at December 31, 2018, by contractual maturity is shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. For purposes of the maturity table, mortgage-backed securities, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been allocated over maturity groupings based on the weighted-average contractual maturities of underlying collateral. The mortgage-backed securities may mature earlier than their weighted-average contractual maturities because of principal prepayments.

Interest-Bearing Deposits
 
The Company had $43.0 million and $55.0 million in overnight investments at the Federal Reserve at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which amount is included in interest-bearing deposits. First Defiance had interest-earning deposits at the FHLB of Cincinnati and other financial institutions amounting to $1.7 million and $2.0 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
Residential Loan Servicing Activities
 
Servicing mortgage loans for investors involves a contractual right to receive a fee for processing and administering loan payments on mortgage loans that are not owned by the Company and are not included on the Company’s balance sheet. This processing involves collecting monthly mortgage payments on behalf of investors, reporting information to those investors on a monthly basis and maintaining custodial escrow accounts for the payment of principal and interest to investors and property taxes and insurance premiums on behalf of borrowers. At December 31, 2018, First Federal serviced 14,606 loans totaling $1.41 billion of principal. The vast majority of the loans serviced for others are fixed rate conventional mortgage loans. The Company primarily sells its loans to, and then services for, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and FHLB. At December 31, 2018, 66.40%, 32.70% and 0.85% of the Company’s sold loans were to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and FHLB, respectively.
 
As compensation for its mortgage servicing activities, the Company receives servicing fees, usually approximating 0.25% per annum of the loan balances serviced, plus any late charges collected from delinquent borrowers and other fees incidental to the services provided. In the event of a default by the borrower, the Company receives no servicing fees until the default is cured.
 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the number and aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans serviced by the Company, including both fixed and adjustable rate loans, at various interest rates:

Lending Activities
 
General – A savings bank generally may not make loans to one borrower and related entities in an amount which exceeds 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus, although loans in an amount equal to an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus may be made to a borrower if the loans are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Real estate is not considered “readily marketable collateral.” Certain types of loans are not subject to these limits. In applying these limits, loans to certain borrowers may be aggregated. Notwithstanding the specified limits, a savings bank may lend to one borrower up to $500,000 “for any purpose.” At December 31, 2018, First Federal’s limit on loans-to-one borrower was $52.6 million and its five largest loans (including available lines of credit) or groups of loans to one borrower, including related entities, were $30.5 million, $28.4 million, $28.2 million, $26.8 million and $26.6 million. All of these loans or groups of loans were performing in accordance with their terms at December 31, 2018.
Loan Portfolio Composition – The net increase in net loans receivable over the prior year was $189.7 million, $407.4 million (including $285.4 million acquired from CSB) and $137.8 million at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The loan portfolio contains no foreign loans. The Company’s loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in the northwest and central Ohio, northeast Indiana, and southeast Michigan market areas. Management has identified lending for income generating rental properties as an industry concentration. Total loans for income generating rental property totaled $982.5 million at December 31, 2018, which represents 37.9% of the Company’s loan portfolio.

In addition to the loans reported above, First Defiance had $6.6 million, $10.4 million, $9.6 million, $5.5 million, and $4.5 million in loans classified as held for sale at December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The fair value of such loans, which are all single-family residential mortgage loans, approximated their carrying value for all years presented.
 
Contractual Principal, Repayments and Interest Rates – The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 2018, regarding the dollar amount of gross loans maturing in First Defiance’s portfolio, based on the contractual terms to maturity. Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less.

The schedule above does not reflect the actual life of the Company’s loan portfolio. The average life of loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments and due-on-sale clauses, which give First Defiance the right to declare a conventional loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid.
 
The following table sets forth the dollar amount of gross loans due after one year from December 31, 2018, which has fixed interest rates or which have floating or adjustable interest rates.

Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans – The lending activities of First Federal are subject to the written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Board of Directors and management. Loan originations are obtained from a variety of sources, including referrals from existing customers, real estate brokers, developers and builders, newspaper, internet and radio advertising and walk-in customers.
 
First Federal’s loan approval process for all types of loans is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan and the adequacy of the value of the collateral that will secure the loan.
 
A commercial loan application is first reviewed by a commercial lender and underwritten by a commercial credit analyst. All loan requests must be presented for review or approval to a Regional Credit Officer. Loans which exceed $1,000,000 must then be presented to the Chief Credit Officer or Credit Administration Officer for approval. These two positions can also approve loans up to $2,000,000 individually or $4,000,000 when using their authority concurrently. Any loan in excess of these limits must be presented for approval to the Executive Loan Committee.
 
Residential mortgage applications are accepted by retail lenders or branch managers, who utilize an automated underwriting system to review the loan request. First Federal also receives mortgage applications via an online residential mortgage origination system. A final approval of all residential mortgage applications is made by a member of a centralized underwriting staff within their designated lending limits. Loan requests in excess or outside an individual underwriter’s limit are approved by a Regional or Chief Credit Officer and, if necessary, by the Executive Loan Committee.
 
Retail lenders and branch managers are authorized to originate and approve direct consumer loan requests that are within policy guidelines and within the lender’s approved lending limit. Loans in excess of the lender’s approved lending limit may be approved by retail lending managers up to their approved lending limit. Loans in excess of the retail lending manager’s authorized lending limit or outside of policy must be approved by a Regional or Chief Credit Officer and, if necessary, by the Executive Loan Committee.
 
First Federal offers adjustable-rate loans in order to decrease the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates. The demand for adjustable-rate loans in First Federal’s primary market area has been a function of several factors, including customer preference, the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the interest rates offered for fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment.
 
Adjustable-rate loans represented 22.0% of First Federal’s total originations of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans in 2018 compared to 9.9% and 10.8% during 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 

- 10 -
------

 

Adjustable-rate loans decrease the risks associated with changes in interest rates, but involve other risks, primarily because as interest rates rise, the payment by the borrower rises to the extent permitted by the terms of the loan, thereby increasing the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates.
 
The following table shows total loans originated, loan reductions, and the net increase in First Federal’s total loans and loans held for sale during the periods indicated:

Asset Quality
 
First Defiance’s credit policy establishes guidelines to manage credit risk and asset quality. These guidelines include loan review and early identification of problem loans to ensure sound credit decisions. First Defiance’s credit policies and review procedures are meant to minimize the risk and uncertainties inherent in lending. In following the policies and procedures, management must rely on estimates, appraisals and evaluations of loans and the possibility that changes in these could occur because of changing economic conditions.
Delinquent Loans — The following table sets forth information concerning delinquent loans at December 31, 2018, in dollar amount and as a percentage of First Defiance’s total loan portfolio. The amounts presented represent the total outstanding principal balances of the related loans, rather than the actual payment amounts that are past due.

Overall, the level of delinquencies at December 31, 2018, declined slightly from the levels at December 31, 2017, when First Defiance reported that 0.53% of its outstanding loans were at least 30 days delinquent. The level of total loans 90 or more days delinquent has increased to 0.32% at December 31, 2018, from 0.20% at December 31, 2017. The level of total loans 60-89 days delinquent decreased to 0.07% at December 31, 2018, from 0.12% at December 31, 2017. The level of loans that were 30 to 59 days past due decreased to 0.10% at December 31, 2018, from 0.21% at December 31, 2017. Management has assessed the collectability of all loans that are 90 days or more delinquent as part of its procedures in establishing the allowance for loan losses.
 
Non-performing Assets – All loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on non-accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collectability of additional interest is not expected. Generally, First Defiance places all loans more than 90 days past due on non-accrual status. First Defiance also places loans on non-accrual status when the loan is paying as agreed but the Company believes the financial condition of the borrower is such that this classification is warranted. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, total unpaid interest accrued to date is reversed. Subsequent payments are generally applied to the outstanding principal balance but may be recorded as interest income, depending on the assessment of the ultimate collectability of the loan. First Defiance considers that a loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due (both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. First Defiance measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent. If the estimated recoverability of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment, First Defiance will recognize impairment by allocating a portion of the allowance for loan losses on cash flow dependent loans and by charging off the deficiency on collateral dependent loans.
 
Loans originated by First Federal having principal balances of $45.8 million, $56.3 million and $27.4 million were considered impaired as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts of impaired loans exclude large groups of small-balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment such as residential mortgage, consumer installment and credit card loans, except for those classified as troubled debt restructurings. There was $1.8 million of interest received and recorded in income during 2018 related to impaired loans. There was $1.4 million and $1.7 million recorded in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Unrecorded interest income based on the loan’s contractual terms on these impaired loans and all non-performing loans in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $1.1 million, $1.1 million, and $1.2 million, respectively. The average recorded investment in impaired loans during 2018, 2017 and 2016 (excluding loans accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310 Subtopic 30) was $49.2 million, $47.4 million and $32.8 million, respectively. The total allowance for loan losses related to these loans was $0.6 million, $0.8 million, and $0.8 million at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Real estate acquired by foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. First Defiance also repossesses other assets securing loans, consisting primarily of automobiles. When such property is acquired it is recorded at fair value less cost to sell. Costs relating to development and improvement of property are capitalized, whereas costs relating to holding the property are expensed. Valuations are periodically performed by management and a write-down of the value is recorded with a corresponding charge to operations if it is determined that the carrying value of property exceeds its estimated net realizable value. During 2018, First Defiance recognized $552,000 of expense related to write-downs in value of real estate acquired by foreclosure or acquisition. The balance of real estate owned at December 31, 2018, was $1.2 million. During 2017, there was $20,000 of expense related to write-downs in fair value of real estate acquired by foreclosure or acquisition. The balance of real estate owned at December 31, 2017 was $1.5 million.
 
As of December 31, 2018, First Defiance’s total non-performing loans amounted to $19.0 million or 0.75% of total loans (net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs), compared to $30.7 million or 1.31% of total loans, at December 31, 2017. Non-performing loans are loans which are more than 90 days past due or on non-accrual. The non-performing loan balance for 2018 includes $16.3 million of loans that were originated by First Federal and also considered impaired, compared to $25.5 million for 2017.

Allowance for Loan Losses – First Defiance maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan loss is made up of two components. The first is a general reserve, which is used to record loan loss reserves for groups of homogenous loans in which the Company estimates the losses incurred in the portfolio based on quantitative and qualitative factors.
 
The second component of the allowance for loan loss is the specific reserve in which the Company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individual credits. In evaluating the adequacy of its allowance each quarter, management grades all loans in the commercial portfolio. See “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Allowance for Loan Losses” for further discussion on management’s evaluation of the allowance for loan losses.
 

- 13 -
------

 

Loans are charged against the allowance when such loans meet the Company’s established policy on loan charge-offs and the allowance itself is adjusted quarterly by recording a provision for loan losses. As such, actual losses and losses provided for should be approximately the same if the overall quality, composition and size of the portfolio remained static along with a static loan environment. To the extent that the portfolio grows at a rapid rate or overall quality or the loan environment deteriorates, the provision generally will exceed charge-offs. However, in certain circumstances, net charge-offs may exceed the provision for loan losses when management determines that loans previously provided for in the allowance for loan losses are uncollectible and should be charged-off or as overall credit or the loan environment improves. Although management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations, future adjustments to the allowances may be necessary, and net earnings could be significantly affected, if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations.
 
At December 31, 2018, First Defiance’s allowance for loan losses totaled $28.3 million compared to $26.7 million at December 31, 2017. The following table sets forth the activity in First Defiance’s allowance for loan losses during the periods indicated.

The provision for credit losses decreased in 2018 from the previous year despite growth in the loan portfolio due to a decrease in net charge-offs and improving credit quality. Management feels that the level of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2018, is sufficient to cover the estimated losses incurred but not yet recognized in the loan portfolio.

Sources of Funds
 
General – Deposits are the primary source of First Defiance’s funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, First Defiance derives funds from loan principal repayments. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings from the FHLB may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources. They may also be used on a longer-term basis for general business purposes. During 2007, First Defiance issued $15.0 million of trust preferred securities through an unconsolidated affiliated trust. Proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes including funding of dividends and stock buybacks as well as bolstering regulatory capital at the First Federal level. First Defiance also issued $20.0 million of similar trust preferred securities in 2005.
Deposits –  First Defiance’s deposits are attracted principally from within First Defiance’s primary market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, and term certificate accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate.
 
To supplement its funding needs, First Defiance also has the ability to utilize the national market for certificates of deposit. First Defiance has used these deposits in the past and could in the future if necessary. First Defiance has no national market certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2018 or 2017.

First Defiance borrows funds under a variety of programs at the FHLB. As of December 31, 2018, there was $85.2 million outstanding under various FHLB advance programs. First Defiance utilizes short-term advances from the FHLB to meet cash flow needs and for short-term investment purposes. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, no outstanding balances existed under First Defiance’s short-term Cash Management Advance Line of Credit. The total available under the Cash Management Advance Line is $15.0 million. In addition, First Defiance has a $100.0 million REPO Advance line of credit available, under which $25.0 million was drawn at December 31, 2018. There were no borrowings against this line at December 31, 2017. Amounts are generally borrowed under these lines on an overnight basis. First Defiance’s total borrowing capacity at the FHLB is limited by various collateral requirements. Eligible collateral includes mortgage loans, home equity loans, non-mortgage loans, cash, and investment securities. At December 31, 2018, other than amounts available on the REPO and Cash Management line, First Defiance had additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB of $447.4 million as a result of these collateral requirements.
 
As a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati, First Federal must maintain a minimum investment in the capital stock of that FHLB in an amount defined in the FHLB’s regulations. First Federal is permitted to own stock in excess of the minimum requirement and was in compliance with the minimum requirement with an investment in stock of the FHLB of Cincinnati of $14.2 million at December 31, 2018, and $16.0 million at December 31, 2017. First Federal held stock of the FHLB of Indianapolis of $2,500 at December 31, 2018, and $5,000 at December 31, 2017.
 
Each FHLB is required to establish standards of community investment or service that its members must maintain for continued access to long-term advances from the FHLB. The standards take into account a member’s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act and its record of lending to first-time homebuyers.
 
For additional information regarding First Defiance’s FHLB advances and other debt see Notes 12 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Subordinated Debentures – In March 2007, the Company sponsored an affiliated trust, First Defiance Statutory Trust II (“Trust Affiliate II”) that issued $15.0 million of Guaranteed Capital Trust Securities (“Trust Preferred Securities”). In connection with the transaction, the Company issued $15.5 million of Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (“Subordinated Debentures”) to Trust Affiliate II. Trust Affiliate II was formed for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of these capital securities solely in Subordinated Debentures of the Company. The Subordinated Debentures held by Trust Affiliate II are the sole assets of the trust. Distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate II are payable quarterly at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 1.5%. The Coupon rate payable on the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate II was 4.29% and 3.09% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
The Trust Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the Subordinated Debentures. The Company entered into an agreement that fully and unconditionally guarantees the Trust Preferred Securities subject to the terms of the guarantee. The Trust Preferred Securities and Subordinated Debentures mature on June 15, 2037, but can be redeemed at the Company’s option at any time now.

In October 2005, the Company formed an affiliated trust, First Defiance Statutory Trust I (“Trust Affiliate I”) that issued $20.0 million of Trust Preferred Securities. In connection with the transaction, the Company issued $20.6 million of Subordinated Debentures to Trust Affiliate I. Trust Affiliate I was formed for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of these capital securities solely in Subordinated Debentures of the Company. The Subordinated Debentures held by Trust Affiliate I are the sole assets of the trust. Distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate I are payable quarterly at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 1.38%, or 4.17% and 2.97% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
The Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate I are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the Subordinated Debentures. The Company entered into an agreement that fully and unconditionally guarantees the Trust Preferred Securities subject to the terms of the guarantee. The Trust Preferred Securities and Subordinated Debentures mature on December 15, 2035, but can be redeemed by the Company at any time now.
 

Employees
---------

 
First Defiance had 696 employees at December 31, 2018. None of these employees are represented by a collective bargaining agent, and First Defiance believes that it maintains good relationships with its personnel.
 

Competition
-----------

 
Competition in originating commercial real estate and commercial loans comes mainly from commercial banks with banking center offices in the Company’s market area. Competition for the origination of mortgage loans arises mainly from savings associations, commercial banks, and mortgage companies. The distinction among market participants is based on a combination of price, the quality of customer service and name recognition. The Company competes for loans by offering competitive interest rates and product types and by seeking to provide a higher level of personal service to borrowers than is furnished by competitors. First Federal has a significant market share of the lending markets in which it conducts operations, except for central Ohio.
 
Management believes that First Federal’s most direct competition for deposits comes from local financial institutions. The distinction among market participants is based on price and the quality of customer service and name recognition. First Federal’s cost of funds fluctuates with general market interest rates. During certain interest rate environments, additional significant competition for deposits may be expected from corporate and governmental debt securities, as well as from money market mutual funds. First Federal competes for conventional deposits by emphasizing quality of service, extensive product lines and competitive pricing.
 
Regulation
 
General – First Defiance is subject to regulation examination and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board (“Federal Reserve”). First Federal is subject to regulation, examination and oversight by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). Because the FDIC insures First Federal’s deposits, First Federal is also subject to examination and regulation by the FDIC. In addition, First Federal is subject to regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) which was established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) and has broad powers to adopt and enforce consumer protection regulations. First Defiance and First Federal must file periodic reports with the Federal Reserve and the OCC and examinations are conducted periodically by the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC to determine whether First Defiance and First Federal are in compliance with various regulatory requirements and are operating in a safe and sound manner.
 
First Defiance is also subject to various Ohio laws which restrict takeover bids, tender offers and control-share acquisitions involving public companies which have significant ties to Ohio.

Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act
 
On May 25, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) was signed into law. The Regulatory Relief Act was designed to provide regulatory relief for banking organizations, particularly for all but the very largest, those with assets in excess of $250 billion. Bank holding companies with assets of less than $100 billion are no longer subject to enhanced prudential standards, and those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be relieved of those requirements in 18 months, unless the Federal Reserve Board takes action to maintain those standards. Certain regulatory requirements applied only to banks with assets in excess of $50 billion and so did not apply to First Federal even before the enactment of the Regulatory Relief Act.
 
The Regulatory Relief Act also provides that the banking regulators must adopt regulations implementing the provision that banking organizations with assets of less than $10 billion are permitted to satisfy capital standards and be considered “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework if their leverage ratios of tangible assets to average consolidated assets is between 8% and 10%, unless the bank’s federal banking agency determines that the organization’s risk profile warrants a more stringent leverage ratio. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have proposed for comment the leverage ratio framework for any banking organization with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, limited amounts of certain types of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%. The community bank leverage ratio would be calculated as the ratio of tangible equity capital divided by average total consolidated assets. Tangible equity capital would be defined as total bank equity capital or total holding company equity capital, as applicable, prior to including minority interests, and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, goodwill and other intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing assets). Average total assets would be calculated in a manner similar to the current tier 1 leverage ratio denominator in that amounts deducted from the community bank leverage ratio numerator would also be excluded from the community bank leverage ratio denominator.
 
The OCC, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC also adopted a rule providing banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of new current expected credit loss methodology accounting under U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
 
The Regulatory Relief Act also relieves bank holding companies and banks with assets of less than $100 billion in assets from certain record-keeping, reporting and disclosure requirements.
 
Holding Company Regulation –  First Defiance is a unitary thrift holding company and is subject to the Federal Reserve regulations, examination, supervision and reporting requirements. Federal law generally prohibits a thrift holding company from controlling any other savings association or thrift holding company, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve, or from acquiring or retaining more than 5% of the voting shares of a savings association or holding company thereof, which is not a subsidiary.
 
Regulatory Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action – The federal banking regulators have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for financial institutions and their holding companies, designed to absorb losses. The guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework, which makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Capital levels as measured by these standards are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions.
 
In July 2013, the federal banking regulators issued final new capital rules applicable to smaller banking organizations which also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The new minimum capital requirements became effective on January 1, 2015, whereas a new capital conservation buffer and deductions from common equity capital phased in from January 1, 2016, through January 1, 2019.
 

- 19 -
------

 

The rules include (a) a minimum common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio of 4.5%, (b) a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, (c) a minimum total capital ratio of 8.0%, and (d) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%.
 
Common equity for the CET1 capital ratio includes common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interests in the form of common stock, less the majority of certain regulatory deductions.
 
Tier 1 capital includes common equity as defined for the CET1 capital ratio, plus certain non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, cumulative preferred stock and related surplus and trust preferred securities that have been grandfathered (but which are not permitted going forward), and limited amounts of minority interests in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, less certain deductions.
 
Tier 2 capital, which can be included in the total capital ratio, includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debt) and limited amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”), subject to new eligibility criteria, less applicable deductions.
 
The deductions from CET1 capital include goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing assets above certain levels, gains on sale in connection with a securitization, investments in a banking organization’s own capital instruments and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (above certain levels).
 
Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, one of several risk weights is applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
 
The rules also place restrictions on the payment of capital distributions, including dividends, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the company does not hold a capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5% composed of CET1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, or if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. The capital conservation buffer was fully phased in effective January 1, 2019 at 2.5%.
 
The federal banking agencies have established a system of “prompt corrective action” to resolve certain problems of undercapitalized banks. This system is based on five capital level categories for insured depository institutions: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” The federal banking agencies may (or in some cases must) take certain supervisory actions depending upon a bank's capital level. For example, the banking agencies must appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank within 90 days after it becomes "critically undercapitalized" unless the bank's primary regulator determines, with the concurrence of the FDIC, that other action would better achieve regulatory purposes. Banking operations otherwise may be significantly affected depending on a bank's capital category. For example, a bank that is not "well capitalized" generally is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market, and the holding company of any undercapitalized depository institution must guarantee, in part, specific aspects of the bank's capital plan for the plan to be acceptable.
 
Effective January 1, 2015, in order to be “well-capitalized,” a financial institution must have a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital of at least 8% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and the institution must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2018, First Federal met the ratio requirements in effect to be deemed "well-capitalized." See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements which is incorporated herein by reference.

In September 2017, the Federal Reserve, along with other bank regulatory agencies, proposed amendments to its capital requirements to simplify various aspects of the capital rules for community banks, including First Federal, in an attempt to reduce the regulatory burden for such smaller financial institutions. In November 2017, the federal banking agencies extended, for the community banks, the existing capital requirements for certain items that were scheduled to change effective January 1, 2018, in light of the simplification amendments being considered. As described above, the bank regulatory agencies have proposed revised capital requirements under the Regulatory Relief Act.

Dividends – Dividends paid by First Federal to First Defiance are subject to various regulatory restrictions. First Federal paid $22.0 million in dividends to First Defiance in 2018 and $13.0 million in 2017. Generally, First Federal may not pay dividends to First Defiance in excess of its net profits (as defined by statute) for the last two fiscal years, plus any year-to-date net profits without the approval of the OCC. First Insurance paid $1.6 million in dividends to First Defiance in 2018 and $1.8 million in dividends in 2017. First Defiance Risk Management paid $950,000 in dividends to First Defiance in 2018 and $1.0 million in dividends in 2017.
 
First Defiance’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is primarily dependent on its receipt of dividends from the Subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve expects First Defiance to serve as a source of strength for First Federal and may require First Defiance to retain capital for further investment in First Federal, rather than pay dividends to First Defiance shareholders. Payment of dividends by First Defiance or First Federal may be restricted at any time at the discretion of its applicable regulatory authorities if they deem such dividends to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. These provisions could have the effect of limiting First Defiance's ability to pay dividends on its common shares.
 
Transactions with Insiders and Affiliates – Loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders and their related interests must conform to the lending limits. Most loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders must be approved in advance by a majority of the “disinterested” members of board of directors of the association with any “interested” director not participating. All loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions with the general public or as offered to all employees in a company-wide benefit program. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional restrictions. All transactions between savings associations and their affiliates must comply with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (“FRA”) and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W. An affiliate of a savings association is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the savings association. First Defiance, First Defiance Risk Management and First Insurance are affiliates of First Federal.
 
Deposit Insurance – The FDIC maintains the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF’), which insures the deposit accounts of First Federal to the maximum amount provided by law. The general insurance limit is $250,000 per separately insured depositor. This insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.
 
The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on each insured institution quarterly based on risk characteristics of the institution. The FDIC may also impose a special assessment in an emergency situation.
 
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (“DRR”), which is the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits of the total industry. In March 2016, the FDIC adopted final rules designed to meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. The FDIC’s rules reduced assessment rates on all banks but imposed a surcharge on banks with assets of $10 billion or more until the DRR reaches 1.35% and provide assessment credits to banks with assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their assessments that contribute to the increase of the DRR to 1.35%. The DRR reached 1.36% at September 30, 2018. The credits will be applied when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%. The rules also changed the method to determine risk-based assessment rates for established banks with less than $10 billion in assets to better ensure that banks taking on greater risks pay more for deposit insurance than less risky banks.
 
In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the DIF. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in September 2019. The Financing Corporation has projected that the last assessment will be collected on the March 29, 2019 FDIC invoice.

As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, federally-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any federally-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against insured institutions. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or written agreement entered into with the FDIC.
 
Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations – Banks are subject to regular examination to ensure compliance with federal statutes and regulations applicable to their business, including consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations. Potential penalties under these laws include, but are not limited to, fines. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has adopted numerous rules with respect to consumer protection laws, amending some existing regulations and adopting new ones, and has commenced enforcement actions. The following are just some of the consumer protection laws applicable to First Federal:
 
•      Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”): imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation to fulfill the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
 
•      Equal Credit Opportunity Act: prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction on the basis of any of various criteria.
 
•      Truth in Lending Act: requires that credit terms are disclosed in a manner that permits a consumer to understand and compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.
 
•      Fair Housing Act: makes it unlawful for a lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person on the basis of any of certain criteria.
 
•      Home Mortgage Disclosure Act: requires financial institutions to collect data that enables regulatory agencies to determine whether the financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the communities in which they are located.
 
•      Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act: requires that lenders provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements and prohibits abusive practices that increase borrowers’ costs.
 
•      Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: requires financial institutions to establish policies and procedures to restrict the sharing of non-public customer data with non-affiliated parties and to protect customer information from unauthorized access.
 
The banking regulators also use their authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices by banks that may not necessarily fall within the scope of specific banking or consumer finance law.
 
In October 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule (the “Payday Rule”) with respect to certain consumer loans to be effective on January 16, 2018, although compliance with most sections is required starting on August 19, 2019. The first major part of the rule makes it an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make short-term and longer-term loans with balloon payments (with certain exceptions) without reasonably determining that the borrower has the ability to repay the loan. The second major part of the rule applies to the same types of loans as well as certain other longer-term loans that are repaid directly from the borrower's account. The rule states that it is an unfair and abusive practice for the lender to withdraw payment from the borrower's account after two consecutive payment attempts have failed, unless the lender obtains the consumer's new and specific authorization to make further withdrawals from the account. The rule also requires lenders to provide certain notices to the borrower before attempting to withdraw payment on a covered loan from the borrower’s account.

On February 6, 2019, the CFPB issued two proposals with respect to the Payday Rule. First, the CFPB proposed to delay the compliance date for the mandatory underwriting provisions of the Payday Rule to November 19, 2020. It has requested comments on the proposed delay to be made within 30 days. Second, the CFPB proposed to rescind provisions of the Payday Rule that (1) provide that it is an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make a covered short-term or longer-term balloon-payment loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan according to its terms; (2) prescribe mandatory underwriting requirements for making the ability-to-repay determination; (3) provide exemptions of certain loans from the mandatory underwriting requirements; and (4) provide related definitions, reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The CFPB has requested comments to be made within 90 days on this proposal. These proposals do not change the provisions of the Payday Rule that address lender payment practices with respect to covered loans. The CFPB also stated that it will be considering other changes to the Payday Rule in response to requests received for exemptions of certain types of lenders or loan products and may commence separate additional rulemaking initiatives.
 
CRA - Under the CRA, every FDIC-insured institution is obligated, consistent with safe and sound banking practices, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking regulator, in connection with the examination of an insured institution, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to consider this record in its evaluation of certain applications to banking regulators, such as an application for approval of a merger or the establishment of a branch. An unsatisfactory rating may be used as the basis for the denial of an application to acquire another financial institution or open a new branch. As of its last examination, First Federal received a CRA rating of “satisfactory.”
 
In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC issued joint interagency guidance on incentive compensation policies (the Joint Guidance) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. This principles-based guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should: (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. The Joint Guidance made incentive compensation part of the regulatory agencies’ examination process, with the findings of the supervisory initiatives included in reports of examination and enforcement actions possible.
 
In May 2016, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved a joint notice of proposed rules (the “Proposed Joint Rules”) designed to prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at financial institutions. The Proposed Joint Rules would apply to covered financial institutions with total assets of $1 billion or more. For all covered institutions, including Level 3 institutions like First Defiance, the proposed rule would:
 
•      prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that are “excessive” or “could lead to material financial loss;”
 
•      require incentive based compensation that is consistent with a balance of risk and reward, effective management and control of risk, and effective governance; and
 
•      require board oversight, recordkeeping and disclosure to the appropriate regulatory agency.
 

- 24 -

Further, as stock exchanges impose additional listing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, public companies will be required to implement “clawback” procedures for incentive compensation payments and to disclose the details of the procedures, which allow recovery of incentive compensation that was paid on the basis of erroneous financial information necessitating a restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. This clawback policy is intended to apply to compensation paid within a three-year look-back window of the restatement and would cover all executives who received incentive awards.
 
Patriot Act – In response to the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act) was signed into law in October 2001. The Patriot Act gives the United States government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. Title III of the Patriot Act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions. Among other requirements, Title III and related regulations require regulated financial institutions to establish a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts and establish enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report suspicious activity. First Federal has established policies and procedures that it considers to be in compliance with the requirements of the Patriot Act.
 
Volcker Rule – The Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule, which became effective in July 2015, does not impact the operations of First Defiance or its subsidiaries, as the Company does not engage in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule and banks under $10.0 billion in assets are exempted from the Volcker Rule provisions.

Item | 1A. Risk Factors
-----+-----------------

 
The risks listed below present risks that could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or business. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company’s business operations.
 
Economic, political and financial market conditions may adversely affect First Defiance’s operations and financial condition. 
 
First Defiance’s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services First Defiance offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, mainly in the State of Ohio, Northeast Indiana and Southeast Michigan. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability of or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, fiscal and monetary policy and other factors beyond First Defiance’s control may adversely affect its deposit levels and cost/composition, demand for loans, the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing the loans it makes. Because First Defiance has a significant amount of real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and First Defiance’s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure.
 
The election of a new United States President in 2016 has resulted in substantial changes in economic and political conditions for the United States and the remainder of the world. Economic turmoil in Europe and Asia and changes in oil production in the Middle East affect the economy and stock prices in the United States. The timing and circumstances of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union (Brexit) and their effects on the United States are unknown. While these changes do not have a direct, immediate impact on First Defiance’s financial performance, we cannot predict how the change in the political climate will affect the economy and First Defiance’s performance in the future.

First Defiance’s loan portfolio includes a concentration of commercial real estate loans and commercial loans, which involve risks specific to real estate value and the successful operations of these businesses.
 
At December 31, 2018, First Federal’s portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled $1.4 billion, or approximately 52.2% of total loans. First Federal’s commercial real estate loans typically have higher principal amounts than residential real estate loans, and many of our commercial real estate borrowers have more than one loan outstanding. As a result, an adverse development on one loan can expose First Defiance to greater risk of loss on other loans. Additionally, repayment of the loans is generally dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic conditions and events outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flows and market values of the affected properties.
 
At December 31, 2018, First Federal’s portfolio of commercial loans totaled $509.6 million, or approximately 19.1% of total loans. Commercial loans generally expose First Defiance to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than commercial real estate or residential real estate loans since repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. First Federal’s commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower such as accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or real estate. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any exists.
 
First Defiance targets its business lending towards small- and medium-sized businesses, many of which have fewer financial resources than larger companies and may be more susceptible to economic downturns. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, First Defiance’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
 
If First Defiance's actual loan losses exceed its allowance for loan losses, First Defiance's net income will decrease. 
 
In accordance with GAAP, First Defiance must maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance, which when combined, are referred to as the allowance for loan losses. First Defiance's allowance for loan losses is based upon a number of relevant factors, including, but not limited to, trends in the level of nonperforming assets and classified loans, current economic conditions in the primary lending area, prior experience, possible losses arising from specific problem loans, and management's evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. However, there are many factors that can result in actual loan losses exceeding the allowance.
 
For instance, in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, First Defiance may rely on information provided to us by customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. First Defiance may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Such information may not turn out to be accurate. Further, First Defiance's loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. As a result, First Defiance may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results.
 

- 26 -
------

 

The amount of future losses also is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond management's control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. Further, federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review First Defiance's loans and allowance for loan losses and may require that First Defiance increase its allowance. Moreover, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has changed its requirements for establishing the allowance, which will be effective for First Defiance in the first quarter of 2020. That accounting change exposes First Defiance to increased risk of failure to establish a sufficient allowance and the possibility that First Defiance will need to increase its allowance substantially through an increase to the provision for loan losses, which will adversely affect First Defiance's net income.
 
As a result of any of the above factors, First Defiance's allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could have a material adverse effect on First Defiance's operating results. There is no assurance that First Defiance will not further increase the allowance for loan losses. Either of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on First Defiance's financial condition and results of operations.
 
Changes in interest rates can adversely affect First Defiance’s profitability.
 
First Defiance’s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond First Defiance’s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Open Market Committee. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest First Defiance receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) First Defiance’s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of First Defiance’s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of certain assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, First Defiance’s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. While we generally invest in securities with limited credit risk, certain investment securities we hold possess higher credit risk since they represent beneficial interests in structured investments collateralized by residential mortgages. All investment securities are subject to changes in market value due to changing interest rates and implied credit spreads. Any substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on First Defiance’s results of operations and financial condition.
 
First Federal originates a significant amount of residential mortgage loans that it sells in the secondary market. The origination of residential mortgage loans is highly dependent on the local real estate market and the current interest rates. Increasing interest rates tend to reduce the origination of loans for sale and consequently fee income, which First Defiance reports as mortgage banking income. Conversely, decreasing interest rates have the effect of causing clients to refinance mortgage loans faster than anticipated. This causes the value of mortgage servicing rights on the loans sold to be lower than originally anticipated. If this happens, First Defiance may be required to write down the value of its mortgage servicing rights faster than anticipated, which will increase expense and lower earnings. Accelerated repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities could result in the reinvestment of funds at lower rates than the loans or securities were paying.
 
Laws, regulations and periodic regulatory reviews may affect First Defiance’s results of operations.
 
The earnings of financial institutions are affected by the regulations and policies of various regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and the CFPB. The Federal Reserve has extensive supervisory authority over the Company, affecting a comprehensive range of matters relating to ownership and control of First Defiance’s shares, First Defiance’s acquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities for the Company to engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels and other aspects of operations. These supervisory and regulatory powers are intended primarily for the protection of First Defiance’s depositors and borrowers and the DIF, rather than First Defiance’s shareholders.

As discussed above, in October 2017, the CFPB issued the Payday Rule with respect to certain consumer loans to be effective on January 16, 2018, although compliance with most sections is required starting on August 19, 2019. Then, on February 6, 2019, the CFPB issued two proposals with respect to the Payday Rule regarding the underwriting provisions. These proposals do not change the provisions of the Payday Rule that address lender payment practices with respect to covered loans. The CFPB also stated that it will be considering other changes to the Payday Rule in response to requests received for exemptions of certain types of lenders or loan products and may commence separate additional rulemaking initiatives. First Defiance is currently assessing the expected effect of this new rule on First Defiance's lending businesses and on First Defiance’s financial condition and results of operations. The costs of complying with this regulation or a determination to discontinue certain types of consumer lending in light of the expense of compliance could have an adverse effect on the financial conditions and results of operations of the Company.
 
Changes in tax laws could adversely affect First Defiance's financial condition and results of operations. 
 
First Defiance is subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes to the tax laws could have a material adverse effect on First Defiance's results of operations. In addition, First Defiance's customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in taxes paid by customers, including changes in the deductibility of mortgage loan related expenses, may adversely affect their ability to purchase homes or consumer products, which could adversely affect their demand for First Defiance's loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on First Defiance's customers could result in defaults on the loans already made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which First Defiance has invested.
 
On December 22, 2017, H.R.1, formally known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” was enacted into law. This new tax legislation, among other changes, limits the amount of state, federal and local taxes that taxpayers are permitted to deduct on their individual tax returns and eliminates other deductions in their entirety. Such limits and eliminations may result in customer defaults on loans already made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which First Defiance has invested.
 
The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time. The potential exists for new laws and regulations, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations. Increased regulation could increase First Defiance’s cost of compliance and reduce its income to the extent that they limit the manner in which First Defiance may conduct business, including its ability to offer new products, charge fees for specific products and services, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads.
 
First Defiance’s ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost may adversely affect net income.
 
First Defiance’s principal sources of liquidity are local deposits and wholesale funding sources such as FHLB advances, Federal Funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and brokered or other out-of-market certificate of deposit purchases. Also, First Defiance maintains a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. First Defiance’s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize its activities or on terms that are acceptable could be impaired by factors that affect First Defiance directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as further disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.
 

- 28 -
------

 

Other possible sources of liquidity include the sale or securitization of loans, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings beyond those currently utilized with the FHLB, the issuance of debt securities and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions, or borrowings from a commercial bank. First Defiance does not currently have any borrowings from a commercial bank, but it has used them in the past.
 
Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to First Defiance’s shareholders, or fulfill obligations such as repaying First Defiance’s borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Competition affects First Defiance’s earnings.
 
First Defiance’s continued profitability depends on its ability to continue to effectively compete to originate loans and attract and retain deposits. Competition for both loans and deposits is intense in the financial services industry. The Company competes in its market area by offering superior service and competitive rates and products. The type of institutions First Defiance competes with include large regional commercial banks, smaller community banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance agencies and mutual funds. As a result of their size and ability to achieve economies of scale, certain of First Defiance’s competitors can offer a broader range of products and services than the Company can offer. In addition, the OCC has recently announced that it will start accepting applications for bank charters from nondepository financial technology companies engaged in banking activities, which will add to the number of parties with whom the Company competes. Further, technological advances allow consumers to pay bills and transfer funds electronically without banks. Consumers can also shop for higher deposit interest rates at banks across the country, which may offer higher rates because they have few or no physical branches. To stay competitive in its market area, First Defiance may need to adjust the interest rates on its products to match rates of its competition, which could have a negative impact on net interest margin.
 
The increasing complexity of First Defiance’s operations presents varied risks that could affect its earnings and financial condition.
 
First Defiance processes a large volume of transactions on a daily basis and is exposed to numerous types of risks related to internal processes, people and systems. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, breaches of data security and our internal control system and compliance with a complex array of consumer and safety and soundness regulations. First Defiance could also experience additional loss as a result of potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.
 
First Defiance has established and maintains a system of internal controls that provides management with information on a timely basis and allows for the monitoring of compliance with operational standards. These systems have been designed to manage operational risks at an appropriate, cost effective level. Procedures exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed. Losses from operational risks may still occur, however, including losses from the effects of operational errors.
 
Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information or confidential trade secrets, whether through a breach of the Company’s computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm its business.
 
Potential misuse of funds or information by First Defiance’s employees or by third parties could result in damage to First Defiance’s customers for which First Defiance could be held liable, subject First Defiance to regulatory sanctions and otherwise adversely affect First Defiance’s financial condition and results of operations.
 

- 29 -
------

 

First Defiance’s employees handle a significant amount of funds, as well as financial and personal information. First Defiance also depends upon third-party vendors who have access to funds and personal information about customers. Cybersecurity breaches of other companies, such as the breach of the systems of a credit bureau, may result in criminals using personal information obtained from such other source to impersonate a customer of First Defiance and obtain funds from customer accounts. Further, First Defiance may be affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with First Defiance’s customers that involve the theft of customer credit and debit card data, which may include the theft of debit card personal identification numbers (“PIN”) and commercial card information used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties. Such data breaches could result in First Defiance incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses, which could result in a material adverse effect on First Defiance’s results of operations.
 
Although First Defiance has implemented systems to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds or information, there can be no assurance that such systems will be adequate or that a taking or misuse of funds or information by employees, by third parties who have authorized access to funds or information, or by third parties who are able to access funds or information without authorization will never occur. First Defiance could be held liable for such an event and could also be subject to regulatory sanctions. First Defiance could also incur the expense of developing additional controls and investing in additional equipment or contracts to prevent future such occurrences. Although First Defiance has insurance to cover such potential losses, First Defiance cannot provide assurance that such insurance will be adequate to meet any liability, and insurance premiums may rise substantially if First Defiance suffers such an event. In addition, any loss of trust or confidence placed in First Defiance by our customers could result in a loss of business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, or result in a loss of investor confidence, hurting First Defiance’s stock price and ability to acquire capital in the future. First Defiance could also lose revenue by the wrongful appropriation of confidential information about its business operations by competitors who use the information to compete with First Defiance.
 
First Defiance could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, First Defiance’s computer systems.
 
First Defiance relies heavily on its own information systems and those of vendors to conduct business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. Risks to the system could result from a variety of factors, including the potential for bad acts on the part of hackers, criminals, employees and others. As one example, some banks have experienced denial of service attacks in which individuals or organizations flood the bank’s website with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal and effect of disrupting the ability of the bank to process transactions. Other businesses have been victims of a ransomware attack in which a business becomes unable to access its own information and is presented with a demand to pay a ransom in order to once again have access to its information. First Defiance is also at risk for the impact of natural disasters, terrorism and international hostilities on its systems or for the effects of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others. These risks also arise from the same types of threats to businesses with which First Defiance deals.
 
Potential adverse consequences of attacks on First Defiance’s computer systems or other threats include damage to First Defiance’s reputation, loss of customer business, costs of incentives to customers or business partners in order to maintain their relationships, loss of investor confidence and a reduction in First Defiance’s stock price, litigation, increased regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement actions, repairs of system damage, increased investments in cybersecurity (such as obtaining additional technology, making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel, training personnel and engaging consultants), and increased insurance premiums, all of which could result in financial loss and material adverse effects on First Defiance’s results of operations and financial condition.

If First Defiance forecloses on collateral property resulting in First Defiance’s ownership of the underlying real estate, First Defiance may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property, resulting in reduced income.
 
A significant portion of First Defiance’s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, First Defiance may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, First Defiance may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage.
 
In addition, when First Defiance forecloses on real property, the amount First Defiance realizes after a default is dependent upon factors outside of First Defiance’s control, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, neighborhood real estate values, interest rates, real estate taxes, operating expenses of the mortgaged properties, zoning laws, governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, and acts of God. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating real property may exceed the rental income earned from such property, and First Defiance may have to sell the property at a loss. The foregoing expenditures could adversely affect First Defiance’s financial condition and results of operations.
 
First Defiance’s business strategy focuses on planned growth, including strategic acquisitions, and its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if First Defiance fails to grow or fails to manage its growth effectively.
 
First Defiance’s ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, its ability to integrate mergers and other acquisitions and manage growth and First Defiance’s ability to raise capital. There can be no assurance that growth opportunities will be available.
 
First Defiance may acquire other financial institutions or parts of institutions in the future, open new branches, and consider new lines of business and new products or services. Expansions of its business would involve a number of expenses and risks, including:
 

· | the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions or expansions into new markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the potential inaccuracy of estimates and judgments used to evaluate the business and risks with respect to target institutions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the time and costs of hiring local management and opening new offices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If First Defiance’s growth involves the acquisition of companies through mergers or other acquisitions, the success of such acquisitions will depend on, among other things, First Defiance’s ability to combine the businesses in a manner that permits growth opportunities and cost efficiencies, and does not cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability of First Defiance to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions.
 
Failure to manage First Defiance’s growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on its business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect First Defiance’s ability to successfully implement its business strategy.

First Defiance’s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations which, to the extent First Defiance requires such dividends in the future, may affect its ability to pay dividends or repurchase its stock.
 
As a unitary thrift holding company, First Defiance is a separate legal entity from First Federal and does not have significant operations of its own. Dividends from First Federal provide a significant source of capital for First Defiance. The availability of dividends from First Federal is limited by various statutes and regulations. The federal banking regulators require that insured financial institutions and their holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of First Federal and other factors, that the OCC, as First Federal’s primary regulator, could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments by First Federal are an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event First Federal is unable to pay dividends to First Defiance, First Defiance may not be able to pay its obligations as they become due, repurchase its stock, or pay dividends on its common stock. Consequently, the potential inability to receive dividends from First Federal could adversely affect First Defiance’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
 
Failure to integrate or adopt new technology may undermine First Defiance’s ability to meet customer demands, leading to adverse effects on First Defiance’s financial condition and results of operations.
 
The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. First Defiance’s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. First Defiance may not be able to effectively implement or have the resources to implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could adversely affect First Defiance’s business, financial condition, or results of operations.
 
A transition away from LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts could negatively affect First Defiance’s income and expenses and the value of various financial contracts.
 
LIBOR is used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which may stop reporting such information after 2021. It is uncertain at this time whether LIBOR will change or cease to exist or the extent to which those entering into financial contracts will transition to any other particular benchmark. Other benchmarks may perform differently than LIBOR or alternative benchmarks have performed in the past or have other consequences that cannot currently be anticipated. It is also uncertain what will happen with instruments that rely on LIBOR for future interest rate adjustments and which remain outstanding if LIBOR ceases to exist.
 
First Defiance may be the subject of litigation, which would result in legal liability and damage to its business and reputation.
 
From time to time, First Defiance may be subject to claims or legal action from customers, employees or others. Financial institutions like First Defiance are facing a growing number of significant class actions, including those based on the manner of calculation of interest on loans and the assessment of overdraft fees. Future litigation could include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. First Defiance is also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and other agencies regarding its businesses. These matters also could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Like other financial institutions, First Defiance is also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against First Defiance could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations and/or cause significant reputational harm to its business.
