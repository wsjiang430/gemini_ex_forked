Item 1. | Business

General 
We are a leading global supplier of high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductors and advanced algorithms and were incorporated in Delaware in 1960. We design, develop, manufacture and market a wide range of products for commercial applications, the majority of which are sold into the enterprise computing, communications, high-end consumer and industrial end-markets. 
Enterprise Computing: data centers, passive optical networks, desktops, notebooks, servers, monitors, printers and other computer peripherals. 
Communications: base stations, optical networks, carrier networks, switches and routers, cable modems, wireless LAN and other communication infrastructure equipment. 
High-End Consumer: handheld products, smartphones, wireless charging, set-top boxes, digital televisions, monitors and displays, tablets, wearables, digital video recorders and other consumer equipment. 
Industrial: analog and digital video broadcast equipment, video-over-IP solutions, automated meter reading, Internet of Things ("IoT"), smart grid, wireless charging, military and aerospace, medical, security systems, automotive, industrial and home automation and other industrial equipment. 
Our end-customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and their suppliers.
Overview of the Semiconductor Industry 
The semiconductor industry is broadly divided into analog and digital semiconductor products. Analog semiconductors condition and regulate "real world" functions such as temperature, speed, sound and electrical current. Digital semiconductors process binary information, such as that used by computers. Mixed-signal devices incorporate both analog and digital functions into a single chip and provide the ability for digital electronics to interface with the outside world. 
The market for analog and mixed-signal semiconductors differs from the market for digital semiconductors. The analog and mixed-signal industry is typically characterized by longer product life cycles than the digital industry. In addition, analog semiconductor manufacturers tend to have lower capital investment requirements for manufacturing because their facilities tend to be less dependent than digital producers on state-of-the-art production equipment to manufacture leading edge process technologies. The end-product markets for analog and mixed-signal semiconductors are more varied and more specialized than the relatively standardized digital semiconductor product markets. 
Another difference between the analog and digital markets is the amount of available talented labor. The analog industry relies more heavily than the digital industry on design and applications talent to distinguish its products from one another. Digital expertise is extensively taught in universities due to its overall market size, while analog and mixed-signal expertise tends to be learned over time based on experience and hands-on training. Consequently, personnel with analog training are scarcer than digital trained engineers. This has historically made it more difficult for new suppliers in the analog market to quickly develop products and gain significant market share. 
Advancements in digital signal processing technology typically drive the need for corresponding advancements in analog and mixed-signal solutions. We believe that the diversity of our applications allows us to take advantage of areas of relative market strength and reduces our vulnerability to competitive pressure in any one area. 
Business Strategy 
Our objective is to be a leading supplier of high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductors and advanced algorithms to the fastest growing segments of our target markets. We intend to leverage our pool of skilled technical personnel to develop new products or, where appropriate, use strategic acquisitions or small strategic investments to either accelerate our position in the fastest growing areas or to gain entry into these areas. In order to capitalize on our strengths in analog and mixed-signal processing design, development and marketing, we intend to pursue the following strategies: 
Leverage our rare analog and mixed-signal design expertise
We have developed a strategy to invest heavily in human resources needed to define, design and market high-performance analog and mixed-signal platform products. We have built a team of experienced engineers who combine industry expertise with advanced semiconductor design expertise to meet customer requirements and enable our customers to get their products to market rapidly. We intend to leverage this strategy to achieve new levels of integration, power reduction and performance, enabling our customers to achieve differentiation in their end systems.

Continue to release proprietary new products, achieve new design wins, and cross-sell products
We are focused on developing unique, new, and proprietary products that bring value to our target customers in our target markets. These products are typically differentiated in performance but are priced competitively. We also focus on achieving design wins for our products with current and future customers. Design wins are indications by the customer that they intend to incorporate our products into their product designs. Although we believe that a design win is an indicator of future potential growth, it does not inevitably result in us being awarded business or receiving a purchase commitment. Our technical talent works closely with our customers in securing design wins, defining new products and in implementing and integrating our products into their systems. We also focus on selling our complete portfolio of products to our existing customers, as we believe the technical expertise of our marketing and sales teams allows us to identify and capitalize on cross-selling opportunities. 
Focus on fast-growing market segments and regions
We have chosen to target the analog and mixed-signal sub-segments of some of the most exciting and fastest growing end-markets. We participate in these markets by focusing on specific product areas within the analog and mixed-signal market, including products for enterprise computing equipment, communications infrastructure, high-end consumer equipment and certain broad-based industrial markets. All of these markets are characterized by their need for leading-edge, high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductor technologies. 
The enterprise computing, communications, high-end consumer, and industrial end-markets we supply are characterized by several trends that we believe drive demand for our products. The key trends that we believe are significant for our future growth include: 

• | Increasing bandwidth over high-speed networks, fueling growth in high speed multimedia transmission;


• | Increasing electronic system requirements for smaller, lighter, more highly integrated and feature-rich mobile devices;


• | Increasing need for more efficient energy management in the home and in industrial environments and the proliferation of "green" standards; and


• | Increasing demands for Internet connectivity to low power sensors.

Our products address these market trends by providing solutions that are ultra-low power thereby extending battery life, small form factor enabling smaller more mobile devices, highly integrated enabling more functionality within devices, and high-performance enabling product differentiation within our customer base. Additionally, as communications functions are increasingly integrated into a range of systems and devices, these products require analog sensing, processing and control capabilities, which increases the number and size of our targeted end-markets. 
Leverage outsourced semiconductor fabrication capacity
We outsource most of our manufacturing in order to focus more of our resources on designing, developing and marketing our products. Our primary outside wafer foundries are based in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Israel, and the United States. We believe that outsourcing provides us numerous benefits including, capital efficiency, the flexibility to adopt and leverage emerging process technologies without significant investment risk, and a more variable cost of goods, which provides us with greater operating flexibility. 
Products and Technology 
We design, develop, manufacture and market high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductors and advanced algorithms. We currently operate and account for results in one reportable segment through three product lines: Signal Integrity, Protection, and Wireless and Sensing. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, we restructured and combined the Power and High-Reliability Products Group with the Wireless and Sensing Products Group.
Signal Integrity Products. We design, develop and market a portfolio of optical data communications and video transport products used in a wide variety of enterprise computing, communications, and industrial applications. Our comprehensive portfolio of integrated circuits ("ICs") for data centers, enterprise networks, passive optical networks ("PON"), and wireless base station optical transceivers and high-speed interfaces ranges from 100Mbps to 400Gbps and supports key industry standards such as Fibre Channel, Infiniband, Ethernet, PON and synchronous optical networks. Our video products offer advanced solutions for next generation high-definition broadcast applications, as well as highly differentiated video-over-IP technology for professional audio video ("Pro AV") applications.
Protection Products. We design, develop and market high-performance protection devices, which are often referred to as transient voltage suppressors ("TVS"). TVS devices provide protection for electronic systems where voltage spikes (called transients), such as electrostatic discharge, electrical over stress or secondary lightning surge energy, can permanently damage sensitive ICs. Our portfolio of protection solutions include filter and termination devices that are integrated with the TVS device. Our products provide robust protection while preserving signal integrity in high-speed communications, networking 
6

and video interfaces. These products also operate at very low voltage. Our protection products can be found in a broad range of applications including smart phones, LCD and organic light-emitting diode TVs, set-top boxes, monitors and displays, tablets, computers, notebooks, base stations, routers, automobile and industrial instruments.
Wireless and Sensing Products. We design, develop and market a portfolio of specialized radio frequency products used in a wide variety of industrial, medical and communications applications, and specialized sensing products used in industrial and consumer applications. Our wireless products, which include our LoRa® devices and wireless radio frequency technology ("LoRa Technology"), feature industry leading and longest range industrial, scientific and medical radio, enabling a lower total cost of ownership and increased reliability in all environments. This makes these products particularly suitable for machine to machine and IoT applications. Our unique sensing technology enables smart proximity sensing and advanced user interface solutions for our mobile and consumer products. Our wireless and sensing products can be found in a broad range of applications in the industrial, medical, and consumer markets. We also design, develop, and market power product devices that control, alter, regulate, and condition the power within electronic systems focused on the LoRa and IoT infrastructure segment. The highest volume product types within this category are switching voltage regulators, combination switching and linear regulators, smart regulators, isolated switches, and wireless charging.
Prior to the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we had a Systems Innovation Products Group that combined the analog and mixed-signal design competencies from our Sierra Monolithics, Inc. ("SMI") and Gennum Corporation ("Gennum") acquisitions and was chartered with developing innovative analog and mixed-signal intellectual property for emerging systems. 
On August 5, 2016, we completed the divestiture of the remaining assets in the Systems Innovation Products Group ("Snowbush IP") to Rambus Inc. ("Rambus") for $32.0 million in cash along with the opportunity to receive additional payments through 2022 based upon a percentage of sales by Rambus of new products expected to be developed by them from the Snowbush IP. In fiscal year 2017, we recorded a gain of $25.5 million on the disposition of the Snowbush IP. Other than this gain, the divestiture did not and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Following the divestiture, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we no longer had a Systems Innovation Products Group.
Our sales by product line are as follows:
 | Fiscal Years
(in thousands) | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
Signal Integrity | $ | 276,040 | | | $ | 263,015 | | | $ | 258,824
Wireless and Sensing | 190,589 | | | 164,569 | | | 140,774 |

(1)On October 5, 2016, we issued a warrant (the "Warrant") to Comcast Cable Communications Management LLC ("Comcast") to purchase up to 1,086,957 shares of our common stock. The Warrant was issued in connection with an agreement between the parties regarding the intended trial deployment by Comcast of a low-power wide-area Network ("LPWAN") in the U.S., based on our LoRa Technology. As of January 27, 2019, the Warrant was fully vested and exercisable for a total of 869,565 shares, with no additional costs to be recognized in future periods. The Warrant was fully exercised and no longer outstanding as of March 15, 2019.
Recent Acquisitions
On December 11, 2018, the Company, through its subsidiary Semtech (International) AG, a Swiss corporation, completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of Trackio International AG, a Swiss corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, "TrackNet"), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8.5 million. TrackNet is a provider of LoRa-based end-to-end solutions for the IoT and provides expertise and intellectual property that will be integrated into the Company's business to support its goal of enabling the growing ecosystem around the Company's LoRa Technology.
On May 2, 2018, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of IC Interconnect, Inc. (“ICI”) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $7.4 million. The addition of ICI is intended to enhance the Company’s U.S. research and development capabilities for its next-generation Z-Pak™ platform. 
On July 1, 2017, the Company acquired AptoVision Technologies Inc. ("AptoVision"), a privately-held provider of uncompressed, zero-frame latency, video-over-IP solutions addressing the Pro AV market. The unique combination of AptoVision's advanced algorithms for real-time, full bandwidth video transmission over IP networks, and Semtech's industry leading high-speed signal integrity and chip development expertise is expected to enable the adoption of Software Defined Video over Ethernet ("SDVoE") and accelerate this natural progression in the evolution of video transport. This transaction expanded the portfolio of our Signal Integrity Products Group.

Seasonality
Historically, our results have reflected some seasonality, with demand levels generally being slightly lower in the industrial and high-end consumer products end-markets during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year in comparison to the second and third quarters.
Intellectual Capital and Product Development
The development of intellectual property ("IP") and the resulting proprietary products is a critical success factor for us. Recruiting and retaining key technical talent is the foundation for designing, developing, and marketing our IP in the form of new proprietary products in the global marketplace. Our ability to recruit and retain our engineering talent is one of the keys to maintaining our competitive advantage. Historically, we have been successful in retaining our key engineering staff and recruiting new talent. One of our strategies to recruit talent is the establishment of multiple design center locations. As a result, we have design centers throughout the world.
8

Circuit design engineers, layout engineers, product and test engineers, application engineers, and field application engineers are our most valuable employees. Together they perform the critical tasks of design and layout of ICs, turning these circuits into silicon devices, and conferring with customers about designing these devices into their applications. The majority of our engineers fit into one of these categories. Most of these engineers have many years of experience in the design, development, and layout of circuits targeted for use in protection, advanced communications and power management, multimedia and data communications, and wireless and sensing applications. We also employ a number of software engineers and systems engineers that specialize in the development of software and systems architecture, who enable us to develop systems oriented products in select markets.
In fiscal year 2019, we incurred $109.9 million of product development and engineering expense, which represents 18% of net sales. Product development and engineering expense for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were $104.8 million and $102.5 million, respectively, or 18% and 19% of net sales, respectively.
We occasionally enter into agreements with customers that allow us to recover certain costs associated with product design and engineering services. Any recovery for these services is typically recognized upon completion of services, which historically lags behind the period in which we recognize the related expense. This difference in recognition timing can create volatility in our reported product development and engineering expenses.
Sales and Marketing
Net sales made directly to customers during fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, were approximately 32%, 34% and 35% of total net sales, respectively. The remaining 68%, 66% and 65% of net sales were made through independent distributors. The decline in direct sales is primarily related to growth in our industrial end-market sales, which includes our LoRa Technology products, as these products are predominantly sold through our distributors.  We have direct sales personnel located throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia who manage the sales activities of independent sales representative firms and independent distributors. We expense our advertising costs as they are incurred.
We operate internationally through our foreign subsidiaries. Semtech (International) AG serves the European and Asian markets from its headquarters in Rapperswil, Switzerland, and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and Japan. Semtech (International) AG also maintains branch offices, either directly or through one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, in multiple countries including China, Taiwan, and South Korea. Semtech Canada Corporation serves the Canadian market for most of the products from our Signal Integrity Products Group, from its headquarters in Burlington, Ontario. Independent representatives and distributors are also used to serve customers throughout the world. Some of our distributors and sales representatives also offer products from our competitors, as is customary in the industry.

Trend-tek Technology Ltd (and affiliates) | 11 | % | | 8 | %
Frontek Technology Corporation (and affiliates) | 10 | % | | 9 | %

Backlog
Our backlog of orders as of the end of fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $72.6 million, $102.9 million and $112.4 million, respectively. The majority of our backlog is typically requested for delivery within six months. In markets where the end system life cycles are relatively short, customers typically request delivery in four to eight weeks. A backlog analysis at any given time gives little indication of our future business except on a short-term basis, principally within the next 45 days. We do not have any significant backlog with deliveries beyond 18 months.
Manufacturing Capabilities
Our strategy is to outsource most of our manufacturing functions to third-party foundries and assembly and test contractors. The third-party foundries fabricate silicon wafers, while the assembly and test contractors package and test our products. We believe this outsourcing permits us to take advantage of the best available technology, leverage the capital investment of others, and reduce our operating costs associated with manufacturing assets.
10

We perform a limited amount of internal probe and final test activities at our facilities in Camarillo, Irvine, and San Diego in California; Neuchâtel in Switzerland; and Reynosa in Mexico. These activities accommodate situations in which tight coupling with product design is desirable or where there are unique requirements. A majority of our very small form factor protection devices are packaged at our facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Our packaged discrete rectifier products are packaged and tested in-house in Reynosa, Mexico. Almost all of our other products are packaged and tested by outside subcontractors.
In keeping with our mostly "fabless" business model, we have no wafer fabrication facilities except for our operation in Reynosa, Mexico. For fiscal year 2019, the Reynosa facility provided almost all of the silicon for our packaged discrete rectifier products, which were approximately 2% of our end product net sales. The remaining end products representing 98% of our net sales were supported with finished silicon wafers purchased from third-party wafer foundries in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Israel and the U.S. We anticipate that substantially all the silicon wafers we require will come from third-party foundries in fiscal year 2020.
Despite our use of third-party wafer foundries for sourcing a majority of our silicon needs, we do maintain internal process development capabilities. Our process engineers work closely with our third-party foundries on the improvement and development of process capabilities. In fiscal year 2019, we purchased the vast majority of our wafers from approximately five different third-party wafer foundries and used various manufacturing processes, including Bipolar, CMOS, RF-CMOS and Silicon Germanium ("SiGe") BiCMOS processes.
While we do have some redundancy of fabrication processes by using multiple third-party foundries, any interruption of supply by one or more of these foundries could materially impact us. As a result, we maintain some amount of business interruption insurance in part to help reduce the financial risk associated with a wafer supply interruption, but we are not fully insured against this risk.
Although our products are made from basic materials (principally silicon, metals and plastics), all of which are available from a number of suppliers, capacity at wafer foundries sometimes becomes constrained. The limited availability of certain materials, such as silicon wafer substrates, may impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand needs or impact the price we are charged. The prices of certain other basic materials, such as metals, gases and chemicals used in the production of ICs can exhibit price volatility depending on the changes in demand for these basic commodities. In most cases we do not procure these materials ourselves, but we are nevertheless reliant on these materials for producing our products because our third-party foundry and package and test subcontractors must procure them. To help minimize risks associated with constrained capacity, we use multiple foundries and have taken other steps to prevent supply interruptions at certain foundries and subcontractors.
In fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, a Chinese foundry provided 16%, 20% and 25% of our total silicon requirements in terms of cost of wafers purchased, respectively.
In addition to our development and production facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which provides assembly services for a majority of our very small form factor protection devices, we use third-party subcontractors to perform almost all of our other assembly and test operations. A majority of our offshore assembly and test activity is conducted by third-party subcontractors based in China, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines. We have operations offices located in the Philippines, Malaysia and China that support and coordinate some of the worldwide shipment of products. We have installed our own test equipment at some of our packaging and testing subcontractors in order to ensure a certain level of capacity, assuming the subcontractor has ample employees to operate the equipment.
Our arrangements with both third-party wafer foundries and package and test subcontractors are designed to provide some assurance of capacity but are not expected to assure access to all the manufacturing capacity we may need in the future.
Competition
The analog and mixed-signal semiconductor and advanced algorithms industries are highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures to continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit and retain key engineering talent, our ability to execute on new product developments, and our ability to persuade customers to design these new products into their applications. 
Our industry is characterized by decreasing average unit selling prices over the life of a product as the volumes typically increase. However, price decreases can sometimes be quite rapid and faster than the rate of increase of the associated product volumes. We believe we compete effectively based upon our ability to capitalize on efficiencies and economies of scale in production and sales, and our ability to maintain or improve our productivity and product yields to reduce manufacturing costs.
We are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with numerous manufacturers of varying size, technical capability and financial strength. A number of these competitors are dependent on semiconductor products as their principal source of income, and some are much larger and better resourced than we are. The number of competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate. Additionally, there has been a trend toward consolidation in our industry as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry. 
11

Such consolidations may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, channel coverage, technology or product functionality.
Intellectual Property and Licenses
We have been granted 201 U.S. patents and 152 foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending with respect to our products and to technologies associated with our business. The expiration dates of issued patents range from 2019 to 2038. Although we consider patents to be helpful in maintaining a competitive advantage, we do not believe they create definitive competitive barriers to entry. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by others. We have no revenue from patents that expire in calendar year 2019 and no material revenue associated with patents that expire in 2020 or 2021.
We have registered many of our trademarks in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Registration generally provides rights in addition to basic trademark protections and is typically renewable upon proof of continued use. We have registered, or are in the process of registering, our SEMTECH trademark in many jurisdictions. In one location use of this trademark is prohibited, but we are permitted to use our Semtech International trade name. This restriction has not had a material impact on our business to date and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in the future.
We also have registered certain materials in which we have copyright ownership, which provides additional protection for this intellectual property.
Employees
As of January 27, 2019, we had 1,335 full-time employees. There were 509 employees in research and development, 260 in sales, marketing and field services, and 192 in general, administrative and finance. The remaining employees support operational activities, including product and test engineering, assembly, manufacturing, distribution and quality functions.
We have not had a work stoppage in the last decade and the only unionized employees are approximately 167 Mexican nationals who work at our manufacturing facility in Reynosa, Mexico. Our employee relations during the last fiscal year have been, and remain, satisfactory.
We adjust our workforce from time to time to meet the changing needs of our business. Competition for key design engineering talent globally is significant.
Government Regulations and Environmental Matters
We are required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with numerous government regulations that are normal and customary to businesses in our industry and that operate in our markets and operating locations.
Our sales that serve the military and aerospace markets primarily consist of high-reliability products that are offered within our Wireless and Sensing product line that have been qualified to be sold in these markets by the U.S. Department of Defense ("DOD"). In order to maintain these qualifications, we must comply with certain specifications promulgated by the DOD. As part of maintaining these qualifications, we are routinely audited by the DOD. Based on current specifications, we believe we can maintain our qualifications for the foreseeable future. However, these specifications could be modified by the DOD in the future or we could become subject to other government requirements, which could make the manufacturing of these products more difficult and thus could adversely impact our profitability in the Wireless and Sensing Product Group. In fiscal year 2019, our sales that serve military and aerospace markets made up 2% of net sales. The U.S. State Department has determined that a small number of special assemblies from the Wireless and Sensing product line are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"). We have a Technical Assistance Agreement in place that permits us to assemble certain of these products in Mexico. International shipments of products subject to ITAR require a State Department license.
