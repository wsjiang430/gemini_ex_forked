Mission
Our mission is to transform how people learn. We are enabling access to high quality, personalized, live learning in any subject, anywhere, at any time. 
Business Overview
We operate a platform for live online learning. Our mission is to transform the way people learn through technology. Our purpose-built proprietary platform leverages technology, including artificial intelligence (“AI”), to connect students, users, parents, guardians, and purchasers (“Learner(s)”) of all ages to tutors, instructors, subject matter experts, educators, and other professionals (“Expert(s)”), delivering superior value on both sides of the network. Our comprehensive learning destination provides learning experiences across numerous subjects and multiple formats, including one-on-one instruction, small group classes, large format group classes, coding, tutor chat, essay review, and adaptive self-study. Our flagship business, Varsity Tutors LLC (“Varsity Tutors”), is one of the nation’s largest platforms for live online tutoring and classes. Our solutions are available directly to Learners, as well as through schools and other institutions. Our platform offers Experts the opportunity to generate income from the convenience of home, while also increasing access for Learners by removing barriers to high-quality live online learning. Our offerings also include Varsity Tutors for Schools, a product suite (including High Dosage, Teacher Assigned, and On Demand Tutoring) that leverages our platform capabilities to offer our online learning solutions directly to education systems. We have built a diversified business across multiple audiences, including: K-8, High School, College, Graduate School, Professional and Adult.
We continue to evolve our product offerings to better meet the needs of Learners by launching Learning Memberships, a monthly membership program that includes access to one-on-one instruction, unlimited live group classes, live and on-demand lessons, coding, tutor chat, essay review, adaptive assessments, and self-study modules. Learning Memberships are for Learners of all ages, ranging from kindergarten to college and adult learners. We’re continuing to invest to expand and broaden the product depth of Learning Memberships with even more learning solutions for our members to deliver unparalleled and enhanced value. 
We believe the transition to a recurring, ‘always on’ relationship, will lead to longer-term and more consistent engagement with the platform by Learners, while also allowing us to serve our customers’ ongoing learning needs across the entirety of their education lifecycle. We also believe that over time Learning Memberships will have a significant impact on Expert engagement and retention, as Experts are seeking longer-term and more consistent earning opportunities.
Finding the exact right Expert to meet the specific and unique needs of a Learner is a critical driver of having a successful learning experience and has a profound impact on Learner satisfaction. Our technology platform identifies and curates the top Experts in every subject, which enables us to match Learners to the Experts who are ideally qualified to help them learn. The result is an exceptional experience for Learners. We use AI to select the ideal Expert for a given Learner’s needs, taking into account several variables, including Learner and Expert attributes, diagnostic assessments, and data from past learning experiences. We believe quality matching is a key differentiator for Nerdy, something that legacy offline models and online directories struggle to do well.
Our platform and multiple learning formats allow us to deliver value in more ways and establish long-term, recurring relationships between Learners and Experts. This generates powerful network effects in our business: high customer satisfaction attracts more Learners to our platform, which in turn attracts more Experts as well. These dynamics have allowed us to deliver durable growth and healthy unit level economics.
Our Two-Sided Network
Nerdy connects Learners of all ages with the Experts they need to advance and develop in-demand skills, pass critical exams and certifications, excel academically, and live up to their potential. Nerdy allows people to learn online in approximately 3,400 subjects, when they want, from the convenience of home, school, and any other location at the click of a button.
Learners
We serve a diverse population of audiences across the entire learning life cycle from kindergarten all the way through professional and adult. Learners use our platform for a broad set of purposes:

The flexibility of access provided by our platform along with the expansive subject catalog and multi-format learning experience at varying price points alleviates the inefficiencies of legacy models.
Experts
Our platform attracts highly qualified and experienced Experts who are passionate about helping people learn and interested in earning supplemental income in a flexible and convenient manner. They come from varied backgrounds, including teachers, professors, professionals, graduate and college students, retirees, and self-employed individuals. Our rigorous multi-step interview and vetting process leverages technology, including AI and process automation, and conditional human review for candidate evaluation. This confluence of technology, process automation, and AI allows us to source high quality Experts at scale with minimal human labor, making the process highly scalable and efficient. We have strong and growing engagement in the Expert network, and have the ability to scale with demand.
Our value proposition for Experts
•Large Learner Population, Strong Income Potential, More Convenient: Our platform empowers Experts with the convenience of immediate access to a large audience of Learners, providing the opportunity for meaningful supplementary earnings without the required effort to find new customers and without geographical constraints.
•Consistent Opportunities: Consumer demand trends toward recurring, ‘always on’ relationships has also impacted how Experts interact with our platform. As a result of our evolution towards Learning Memberships, we have given Experts the ability to develop deeper relationships that allow for more consistent revenue-generating opportunities.
•Flexibility: As the modern workforce mindset shifts toward flexibility and choice, our platform empowers Experts to work from wherever, whenever, and however they want. Giving them convenience and control over their work schedule and providing them with work they can be proud of.
•Purpose-Built Technology: Our platform empowers Experts with interactive technology features such as two-way video, collaborative work-spaces, recording and replay capabilities, and adaptive diagnostic testing, as well as integrated personalization features to make delivering online instruction easy.
•Frictionless Payment Processing: We ensure the Experts are paid on-time and securely with frequent payments, alleviating administrative burden and hassle and allowing them to focus on helping Learners learn.
Market Network Effects
Our platform benefits from several positive and reinforcing network effects. As we leverage technology to improve the match quality between Experts and Learners, we are able to improve the experience on both sides of our network. Our AI leverages millions of usable data points to personalize the experience for each Learner and Expert. The result is a high-quality learning experience across approximately 3,400 subjects. The higher the quality of Experts on our platform, the more Learners are attracted to our platform.
More Learners on our platform leads to more earning opportunities for Experts and more high quality and rewarding interactions with Learners. Our algorithms allocate more work to the best Experts, which helped lead to increased engagement among Learners and Experts. Additionally, access to high-quality Experts has enabled us to add more subjects and more learning formats to our platform. We have built a comprehensive online learning destination that provides Learners of all ages with multiple ways to learn.
Industry Background and Key Trends
There are several favorable trends in the learning market that make our platform and proposition appealing on both sides of the network and we believe that our business will disproportionately win as these category dynamics shift.
•Secular Digitization of Learning: We believe the learning industry is at an inflection point for online adoption and is undergoing rapid digital transformation. Technology has lowered the barriers for individuals to access learning opportunities and connect with Experts on a global scale and is removing the inefficiencies of in-person interactions, increasing affordability, extending geographic access, and providing flexibility and convenience through on-demand online models. AI is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of AI based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. We leverage both internally developed and externally licensed capabilities related to AI, which allows large data sets to be leveraged and understood in a way that can generate substantial insights that drive the personalization of the learning experience. Increased digital connectivity between Learners, Experts, and other key stakeholders is improving communication and accountability to provide increased transparency into Learner achievement.
•Consumerization of Learning: The transition in parents’ and modern Learners’ preferences towards finding, curating, and managing their own learning is reshaping the learning markets and contributing to the digitization of learning. These consumers experience the same level of agency and modern technology-enabled approach they experience in other categories that have digitized. As a result of this shift in consumer behavior, learning providers have emerged that focus on direct-to-consumer models making learning resources, including live learning, available broadly and on-demand. By providing numerous learning formats to help Learners access top Experts across a multitude of formats, including adaptive self-study tools, our platform empowers both Learners and Experts to have more agency, optimize interactions, and enhance their learning and instructing experience.
•Demand for Long-Term, Consistent Learning: Learners are expressing interest in supplemental learning solutions that support a more consistent use pattern over extended periods of time and a default to recurring, ‘always on’ relationships.
•Pandemic’s Impact on Learning Proficiency: The pandemic led to prolonged closures in 2020 and 2021 of K-12 schools and colleges and universities throughout the United States (the “U.S.”). These closures have been a significant driver of learning loss in the last two years for students. The National Center for Education Statistics (“NCES”) published what is known as the “Nation's Report Card” in October 2022. The results showed that fourth and eighth graders fell behind in reading and dropped to levels not seen since 1992. Meanwhile, math scores had the largest ever decline on record. This is the first report card published since the onset of the pandemic, and results are being compared to pre-pandemic scores (2019). To help combat these challenges, we launched our Institutional strategy with the introduction of Varsity Tutors for Schools, a product suite (including High Dosage, Teacher Assigned, and On Demand Tutoring) that leverages the technology infrastructure and product capabilities originally developed for our Consumer business, providing a single comprehensive Learning Platform as a Service that allows institutions to roster entire student bases and deploy solutions for different segments of students. The offerings are highly customizable and can be deployed by school administrators across their entire student populations in a scalable manner. We expect Varsity Tutors for Schools will also be a strong partner for education systems and universities as they continue to evolve their offerings to attract and support their diversified student populations. We view partnering with education institutions, including K-12 school districts and universities, as a durable, long-term opportunity to help improve the way supplemental learning is administered.
•Changing Workforce Dynamics: The advent of technology has dramatically changed how people view work, and platforms that enable interactions directly between providers and consumers are disrupting traditional, antiquated models. The shifting mindset of today’s workforce towards seeking flexibility, freedom, and personal fulfillment has enabled transformation of several categories in recent years. We believe these dynamics will also fundamentally change the way people learn. We have a significant opportunity to leverage technology to connect highly qualified Experts directly to Learners of all ages and to enable high quality live learning at scale.
•Shift to Lifelong and Skills-Based Learning: Our economy has evolved to a knowledge-based economy, with employers competing for workers with the most job-appropriate and up-to-date skill sets. Additionally, technological advancements and their resulting transformational changes across industries are impacting skill requirements in today’s workplace. According to the Future of Jobs Report 2020 published by the World Economic Forum, companies hope to internally redeploy 50% of employees displaced by technological automation and augmentation. As a result, today’s workforce needs to constantly learn new concepts and skills to keep pace with fast-changing job requirements without the heavy penalty of having to temporarily exit the workforce. The Future of Jobs Report 2020 suggests that companies looking to ensure success of these redeployment strategies will, among other things, need to direct their employees to effective resources and meaningful curricula. Our learning platform is ideally positioned to provide today’s professionals the flexibility to continue their learning journey at their convenience while acquiring the requisite skills across a vast range of subjects and multiple learning modalities, and also provide their employers with a return on their investment.
Our Market Opportunity
A recent industry report estimates that the global market for supplemental education in 2020 was estimated to be $1.3 trillion, excluding government-funded education. The market for direct-to-consumer learning is large, fragmented, and ripe for disruption. GSV Ventures estimates that online penetration of this market is expected to grow 5 fold by 2026, which represents a CAGR of 30%, providing significant macroeconomic tailwinds for our business. We believe that advances in technology - specifically the ability to deliver high quality, personalized instruction at an affordable price with more convenience - have created a tremendous opportunity to transform the way learning is delivered. Additionally, with the COVID-19-induced disruptions education institutions have endured in recent years, the receptivity to utilizing technology-enabled, innovative solutions has never been greater. We believe we are at the beginning of a long-term and durable shift in the way supplemental learning will be delivered - a shift that we believe will persist for years to come. We estimate our U.S. direct-to-consumer learning total addressable market was approximately $57 billion in 2020 and will grow to approximately $75 billion by 2025.
In addition to the direct-to-consumer market, we also target long-term relationships with education institutions, which receive a large variety of funding sources. We believe Varsity Tutors for Schools, our product suite that leverages our platform capabilities to offer our online learning solutions directly to education systems, is uniquely positioned to support these education institutions.
Our Solution - A Comprehensive Online Learning Destination
To address the large market opportunity, we built Nerdy and our flagship business, Varsity Tutors, to be a leading, multi-format, online learning destination. Our platform-oriented approach to growth allows us to leverage the shared capabilities we have developed - that serve as building blocks that can be modified for different markets and audiences - and allows us to efficiently enter new markets and modify our product offerings to the unique aspects of each group of Learners. In doing so, 
we’re able to build solutions that improve quality, decrease cost, improve convenience, and meet the needs of Learners, enabling access to high quality live learning that would otherwise not exist in service of helping people learn.
Learning Memberships
In 2022, we continued to evolve our product offerings to better meet the needs of Learners by launching Learning Memberships, a monthly membership program that includes access to one-on-one instruction, unlimited live group classes, live and on-demand lessons, coding, tutor chat, essay review, adaptive assessments, and self-study modules. We’re continuing to invest to expand and broaden the product depth with even more learning solutions for our members to deliver unparalleled and enhanced value.
The membership model has simplified our sales model, while also introducing a lower upfront price point for Learners seeking supplemental learning support. Customer feedback indicates customers like the value, flexibility, and pricing of our Learning Memberships. We believe that the lower upfront costs and tremendous value will make our platform more widely accessible and significantly widen our total addressable market.
Learning Memberships are for Learners of all ages, ranging from kindergarten to college and adult Learners, and can be used in any subject, at any time. Memberships are helping transform our relationship with customers into one that is recurring in nature and spans subjects and learning formats. The model encourages ongoing consistent learning over longer periods of time, which is leading to significant improvements in customer engagement and lifetime value. Learning Memberships provide Learners access to multiple learning formats, including the following:
One-on-One Instruction
Through our one-on-one instruction format, Learners receive a completely personalized learning experience. Our award-winning and purpose-built Live Learning Platform enables collaboration and interaction including features such as two-way video, collaborative workspace, and session recording that not only seeks to replicate the best aspects of the in-person learning experience online, but actually delivers an enhanced experience that was simply not possible offline. Learners use our platform to access highly qualified Experts, on a flexible schedule, from wherever they want. Learners also have access to On Demand Tutoring, a solution that provides Learners immediate access to live online one-on-one instruction 24 hours a day and 7 days a week with no prior appointment necessary.
Live Group Classes
We offer a comprehensive, multi-format, learning experience to meet our Learners’ needs beyond one-on-one instruction. Our interactive, live, online classes allow Learners of all ages to connect in a collaborative and social environment.
•Small Group Classes: Our Small Group Class format is re-inventing the in-person classroom online, allowing Learners to join up to 20 other peers for live lessons in a virtual classroom across a range of topics, including academic, enrichment, foreign languages, test prep, and professional certification. By using adaptive assessments to determine the proficiency of each Learner before placement, the class experience is more tailored to the individualized needs of participants. Classes are taught by highly qualified Experts with deep instructional and teaching experience. Through Q&A sessions, student projects, and individualized attention, the Experts are able to intimately engage with each Learner while providing a more social, less intensive solution than one-on-one instruction.
•Large Group Classes: Through our Large Group Class format, we can facilitate high quality scaled live learning experiences for 500 to over 50,000 students at any given time. Subjects offered range from academic, to test prep, to enrichment.
Adaptive Self-Study
Our adaptive self-study solutions drive engagement with both new and existing Learners on the platform. Tools and resources, such as adaptive assessments, practice problems, and videos to help Learners progress at a pace that works for them, are offered completely free of charge. Our collection of over 200 thousand standards-aligned practice problems, quizzes, flashcards, and diagnostic assessments are delivered on our platform and via our mobile apps, enabling millions of Learners to access quality asynchronous tools to improve learning outcomes. Using the latest advances in learning science and AI, our adaptive assessments can measure a Learner’s proficiency in a given subject in as little as 20 minutes.
Learning Platform as a Service
Our Learning Platform as a Service offers a customizable set of solutions allowing learning to be ‘always on’ and available for Learners. By offering a comprehensive suite of learning solutions, institutions can add services and product offerings over time as needs evolve, allowing Nerdy to be a long-term partner to institutions as they seek recurring and durable relationships. 
Our Learning Platform as a Service offering leverages the technology infrastructure and product capabilities originally developed for our Consumer business, providing a single comprehensive software platform that allows institutions to roster entire student bases and deploy solutions for different segments of students.
In 2022, as part of our ‘always on’ vision, we built two new products for our Institutional business that are oriented toward providing district-wide solutions that can be deployed across entire student and teacher populations, significantly widening the impact we can have with our school district partners. Teacher Assigned is a solution that empowers educators who know students best to schedule face-to-face, personalized support from tutors. Teachers can leverage an extra set of hands focused on reinforcing what happens in the classroom, with a targeted focus on the specific needs of an individual student. On Demand Tutoring provides universal support to all students with access to 24/7 chat-based tutoring, essay editing, and self-directed learning tools. These new solutions are oriented around more comprehensive and strategic relationships with schools and lend themselves to long-term partnerships, as they serve the entire student population. When these new product offerings are combined with our existing high-dosage tutoring product, we believe Nerdy provides the tools that students, teachers, and administrators are seeking by offering access to ‘always on’ educational resources.
Our Institutional solutions also include live instruction (1:1 up to 1:5 live tutoring and small group classes) and adaptive diagnostic assessment and measurement of progress (mapped to state standards). Importantly, by using adaptive diagnostic assessments to determine the subject proficiency of each Learner, our platform based approach enables students of similar subject level mastery to receive personalized instruction in a small group setting. In the future, our Learning Platform as a Service may include enrichment programming, solutions for students with Learning Differences, and other educational tools. The offerings are highly customizable and can be bundled and deployed across entire student and teacher populations in a scalable manner to meet the needs of specific school districts.
Our Competitive Strengths
Innovative, highly scalable technology platform purpose-built for online learning.
We have built our proprietary technology platform from the ground up with the purpose of transforming how people learn. We leverage technology, through AI, process automation, and other technology, to scale high quality, live instruction, and our platform is designed to optimize online Learner-Expert interactions through tech-enabled features. Our platform is built to scale quickly to accommodate high volumes, and the rapid introduction of new learning formats and subjects. In 2022, our platform hosted 2,227 thousand paid sessions serving approximately 158 thousand Active Learners. We believe our highly scalable platform provides us with opportunities to continue to grow with relatively low capital expenditure requirements, where we build a capability or product one time, and leverage it many times across different markets and audiences.
Strong Unit Level Economics
The Learning Membership model is helping transform our relationship with customers into one that is recurring in nature and spans subjects and learning formats. The model encourages ongoing consistent learning over longer periods of time, which is leading to significant improvements in customer engagement and lifetime value.
Customer surveys and engagement trends support our view that Learning Memberships provide significantly more value to customers than purchasing services à la carte. Based upon both our historical experience with customers engaging in learning across multiple formats, as well as our recent experience with Learning Membership customers, we have seen that multi-format engagement is highly correlated with better retention and extending customer lifetime value and monetization.
Superior learning experience powered by a rich dataset
As a result of our online direct-to-consumer model, we are able to instrument and capture a rich dataset that we utilize to enhance the learning experience throughout the customer journey, which also creates a data-driven competitive advantage that would be hard for competitors to replicate. We leverage technology, through AI and process automation, to rigorously identify and vet highly qualified Experts to ensure high quality instruction at scale is consistently delivered to Learners. As one example, our AI powered proprietary matching algorithm analyzes approximately 100 attributes per Learner and Expert to identify the Learner-to-Expert matches with the highest projected probability of a successful interaction. Our data asset grows more valuable as the platform scales, allowing us to better leverage the growing dataset of learning interactions to better personalize the Learner experience. We are leveraging software and AI to scale personalized learning in a way that we believe is unparalleled and nearly impossible to replicate via an antiquated in-person model.
Founder-led, seasoned management team
We are a company of thinkers, builders, and innovators with a passion for learning. Our management team brings extensive technology, consumer brand, e-commerce, and institutional sales experience, and together with our founder, are deeply passionate about transforming how people learn through technology. We embrace diversity of experience, thought, and skill sets to ensure our team has complementary strengths to succeed in a rapidly evolving industry.
Our Growth Strategy
We have multiple growth vectors that will enable us to further scale our platform by attracting and retaining more Learners and Experts through more deep and meaningful relationships.
As a leading provider of live, online learning and one of the largest platforms for live, online learning in the U.S., we attract and help Learners across multiple audience segments and subjects. We are continually investing in broadening our existing catalog of approximately 3,400 subjects for audiences across the learning lifecycle, including live instruction solutions, as well as proprietary content used for adaptive assessments and self-study. We consistently invest in improving our capabilities, technology architecture, and developing new solutions that can be leveraged across new markets and audiences. There is also considerable and relatively untapped opportunity to extend our platform to reach audiences beyond the U.S. We believe that as our range of subjects offered and audiences served through the platform grows across learning categories, our market presence and brand recognition will expand, driving more Learners and Experts to our platform.
Direct-to-Consumer Audience
Our comprehensive learning destination provides learning experiences across numerous subjects and multiple formats, including, one-on-one instruction, small group classes, large format group classes, and adaptive self-study. We are focused on further penetrating our core audiences and continuing to improve the product and customer experience in order to further expand our appeal among our direct-to-consumer audience. As shown through our development of Learning Memberships and On Demand Tutoring, we are constantly exploring new methods of learning that will allow us to broaden our appeal to more Learners. We have seen strong demand and increasing engagement, including in early data surrounding Learning Memberships, as we continue to evolve our services and products toward ‘always on’, recurring relationships with Learners that better serve our multiple direct-to-consumer audiences.
Institutional Audience
The education system in the U.S. is under tremendous stress, creating an environment with immense opportunity for transformation. While COVID-19 accelerated and amplified some of the acute challenges that existed before the pandemic, adding incremental headwinds in the process, it also created an environment where new solutions to these challenges are not only welcome, but actively being pursued. And with recent advancements in technology, like the learning solutions Nerdy offers, transforming the way people learn has never been more possible.
We believe school administrators and educators are rethinking how they can deliver the best outcomes for students, looking for new solutions beyond the traditional approach, which historically solved learning demands only with internal and in-person resources. Educators and students now have the opportunity to embrace not only the wealth of digital content options available, but also the increasingly flexible and personalized learning experiences that drive student outcomes.
In August 2021, we launched our Institutional business, Varsity Tutors for Schools, which leverages and builds on our existing platform capabilities to offer education institutions, including school districts, the ability to deploy our solutions across large groups of students. In 2022, as part of our ‘always on’ vision, we launched Teacher Assigned and On Demand Tutoring for K-12 schools. Our Learning Platform as a Service offering leverages the technology infrastructure and product capabilities originally developed for our Consumer business, providing a single comprehensive software platform that allows institutions to roster entire student bases and deploy solutions for different segments of students. The offerings are highly customizable and can be deployed across large populations in a scalable manner to meet the needs of specific populations. With the strategic investments we are making to adapt our platform for institutions and school districts, we are well-positioned to be the unlimited learning solution of choice. Our unique and scalable platform leverages millions of data points to deliver live, personalized learning, offering administrators and school officials a critical solution as they lead the next generation of Learners. 
Importantly, we believe the capabilities we are building represent only the beginning of our Institutional go-to-market strategy, as our Learning Platform as a Service can easily be adapted and leveraged to serve new audiences beyond schools, such as universities, businesses, and other organizations, driving revenue growth and scale for years to come.
Product Innovation and Adaptation Supporting Changing Needs of our Audiences
We build new products and technology capabilities that will enable us to better meet Learner and Expert needs in the future, support innovation, and help drive continued growth while further strengthening our competitive moat. As we gain further scale, our ability to leverage data to infuse more personalization throughout the experience compounds. This leads to improved retention, monetization, and organically driven growth of new Learners and Experts using the platform. It also allows us to more effectively enter new markets and serve new audiences. We continue to evolve and enhance our product experience to build relevance and find solutions to unmet needs across all of our audiences, which opens up new avenues for new growth and lifetime value expansion, and otherwise accelerates our product roadmap.
Our Technology Platform
Technology is at the core of everything we do. Our Consumer and Institutional models are driven by a scalable technology infrastructure that is engineered for learning. We consistently invest in improving our capabilities and technology architecture, as well as in developing new solutions that can be leveraged across new markets and audiences. Our platform is supported by a team of highly experienced and talented developers. Importantly, the investments we make to support a learning solution for one audience can be scaled to apply to new audiences, resulting in returns that are multiples of our initial investment. At our core, we are a technology business and technology investments persist throughout all aspects of the Learner and Expert journey. There are specific groupings of core competencies, or layers, highlighted below, that we believe to be particularly differentiated and powerful. We collectively call them AI for HI®, short for Artificial Intelligence for Human Interaction.
Moreover, the latest AI advancements are allowing us to rapidly develop transformative experiences involving the real-time generation of content with near zero costs, improving our ability to deliver live human interaction and personalized learning at scale. We have developed new products from these advancements, which represent the initial phase of Nerdy’s implementation of ChatGPT and the latest AI technologies for Consumer Learning Membership customers. We plan to roll out additional products and features for Consumer customers that expand on these new capabilities as a part of Learning Memberships, including practice problem and answer generation for self-study, as well as additional AI-driven tools such as flashcard generation, essay proofreading, and math solvers.
Seasonality
For information about the seasonality of our business, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this report.
Competition
Although we have built a scaled and differentiated platform for live learning, we compete with a variety of competitors both online and offline. We believe that the vast majority of our competition is from offline competitors. Within this market, there exist thousands of companies and hundreds of thousands of individuals that provide supplemental instruction and learning services. These span academics, test preparation, professional training and skills, adult learning, enrichment, and other categories. We believe that offline solutions are inferior to the online solution we have developed. Specifically, we believe that our platform is more efficient, convenient, effective, and affordable than most offline solutions. We believe this value proposition is a big factor in driving consumer adoption of online solutions like ours.
The offline market for live learning, both one-on-one instruction and small group classes, is large and fragmented. We compete for time and attention with many small and local businesses, small proprietorships, and larger national companies including franchises. While we believe our online technology driven solution offers significant benefits when compared to these offline options, we compete with them to attract Learners and Experts to our platform.
While we believe we are one of the few companies that offers a comprehensive destination for live learning online, we do compete with other direct-to-consumer and institutional solutions. Consumers have a variety of choices in terms of competitive options, and some of these competitors are well capitalized. We compete against a variety of tutor and class marketplaces and directories and also against companies that offer asynchronous and self-study products. We believe that consumer awareness is one of the primary barriers to the adoption of our online solution. While we have scaled to hundreds of thousands of users, many people in the U.S. and institutions are not aware of the online solutions we offer. Many still believe they need to drive to a brick-and-mortar location often during rush hour traffic to find supplemental learning assistance. We have invested millions of dollars to drive consumer awareness and believe that we will continue to raise awareness of the value and availability of our platform.
COVID-19 Pandemic
We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. In the first half of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting closure of schools and testing centers created short-term challenges for our business. Many schools went to optional grading, and standardized and professional exams were suspended, which reduced demand for supplemental learning. We leaned into product evolution and completed our long-term transition to delivering live instruction 100% online in April 2020, a goal we had been working toward since first launching our online platform in 2014.
In addition, while COVID-19 accelerated and amplified some of the acute challenges within the U.S education system that existed before the pandemic, adding incremental headwinds in the process, it also created an environment where new solutions to these challenges were both welcome and actively being pursued. Furthermore, with recent advancements in technology, like the learning solutions that we offer, transforming the way people learn has never been more possible. We believe we are at the 
beginning of a long-term and durable shift in the way supplemental learning will be delivered - a shift that we believe will persist for years to come.
For additional discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to “Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements” on page 1 of this report and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.

Immediately prior to the Closing, TPG Pace became a Delaware corporation and was renamed Nerdy Inc. This transaction is referred to herein as the “Reverse Recapitalization.” As a result of the Reverse Recapitalization, Nerdy LLC is consolidated with and into Nerdy Inc.
The Reverse Recapitalization was accomplished through an umbrella partnership corporation (“Up-C”) structure, which is often used by partnerships and limited liability companies (operating as partnerships) undertaking an initial public offering. The Up-C structure allowed legacy Nerdy LLC equity holders (the “Legacy Nerdy Holders”) to retain their equity ownership in Nerdy LLC, an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and provides potential future tax benefits for Nerdy Inc. when the Legacy Nerdy Holders ultimately redeem their pass-through interests for shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”) in Nerdy Inc. as a result of a tax receivable agreement (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”). Under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement, 85% of these potential future tax benefits realized by Nerdy Inc. as a result of such redemptions will be paid to certain Legacy Nerdy Holders.
Human Capital
We are a remote-first company, which means that working remotely is the primary option for our employees. Much like online learning affords Learners the ability to find the best Expert for their needs irrespective of location, we believe a remote-first orientation enables us to access a significantly larger talent pool from which to hire, which can serve as a long-term competitive advantage. As of February 14, 2023, we had approximately seven hundred full and part-time employees, none of whom are covered under a collective bargaining agreement.
Talent Acquisition, Development, Engagement, and Retention
We believe that our employees are our greatest asset and place a premium on the importance of their retention, growth, and development. We offer competitive compensation, including salary and equity, and benefits packages to meet the needs of employees where we operate. All employees are offered training and development opportunities, including unlimited free classes and 52 hours of free tutoring on our Live Learning Platform (for which they provide feedback on their experience with the platform, which helps us improve the platform).
Diversity and Inclusion
We have a diverse talent pipeline that allows us to model our leadership principles, foster innovation, build high performing teams, and deliver results. We firmly believe that a diverse workforce enables stronger company performance, enhances culture, and better positions us to serve the varied needs of our customers. We aspire to and promote a welcoming, inclusive culture that values all people - regardless of sex, gender, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender expression, or experiences - through recruiting outreach and internal connection. We are committed to being an organization that is as diverse as the audiences we serve, and that commitment is a part of every hire we make. As of February 14, 2023, approximately 67% of our employees were women and approximately 31% of employees were racially and ethnically diverse.
Regulatory and Administrative Investigations, Audits, and Inquiries
We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the classification and compensation of Experts, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, business practices, and other matters. Results of investigations, audits, inquiries, and related governmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit, or inquiry having a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly in the event that an investigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or other action. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs associated with cooperating with, or defending against, such matters, reputational risks, and the diversion of management resources and other factors. For additional information regarding the impact of regulatory and 
administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries on our business and financial results, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
Government Regulation
There are a variety of regulations that apply to how we operate our business, including, for example, regulations related to marketing efforts (such as the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”), Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) guidelines related to communications with consumers, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), among others); regulations related to data privacy of consumers (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)) and how we process such information (such as the CCPA and other similar legislation that is or may be enacted (including the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (“CPRA”)), as well as data security and data breaches; regulations related to background checks as regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) and similar state laws and new hire reporting (for employees and independent contractors depending on the state) and other federal, state, and local laws of general applicability to employers, direct-to-consumer companies, and companies in general (these laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks).
There have been statutory changes and resulting ballot initiatives regarding independent contractor status that demonstrate certain sentiment among certain legislatures and the public (both favorable and unfavorable). There are also ongoing proposals as it relates to the classification of independent contractors in various states and cities, and there is potential for federal legislation regarding test(s) to determine whether independent contractors are properly classified by their putative employers. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislative or judicial changes could or would be adopted or implemented, and there are certain proposals that, if adopted, could harm our business through a decrease in the number of Experts available through our platform or through a change to our unit level economics (in the event Experts are deemed to be employees). We may also run the risk of retroactive applications of new laws to our business model that could result in liability or losses.
We are also subject to data privacy and data security laws related to the personal information we collect from Learners and Experts. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted in additional jurisdictions, and certain proposals, if adopted, could harm our business through a decrease in consumer registrations and revenues, or through a change in marketing strategies; however, a federal data privacy and security standard, which is also a possibility, may provide substantial clarity and benefits for businesses that collect and maintain such data.
These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies.
As stated above, we remain subject to a variety of laws and regulations. We monitor changes to applicable state and federal regulations and believe we are in compliance with the existing interpretations or applications of such applicable state and federal regulations. There is also a possibility of retroactive application of new laws to the business as well.
For additional information regarding the impact of government regulation on our business and financial results, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
Data Privacy and Security
We prioritize the trust of Learners, Experts, schools, vendors, and employees and place an emphasis on data privacy and security. The privacy and security programs are designed and implemented in an effort to address the compliance and security requirements of data related to Learners, Experts, schools, vendors, and employees.
We have a dedicated team of professionals that focus on application, network, and system security, as well as security compliance, education, and incident response. We maintain a vulnerability management program designed to identify security vulnerabilities on servers, workstations, and applications, and subsequent remediation of vulnerabilities. Regular internal and external penetration tests are also conducted, and open items are remediated.
We rely on internet systems and infrastructure to operate our business, some of which are managed by third parties. We have implemented physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to help protect our systems. We routinely update, monitor, patch, and upgrade our systems to optimize performance and protect against known and unknown vulnerabilities, material disruptions, or slowdowns. We encrypt external data in transit and use security controls in order to control access to the resources containing personal data or other confidential information.
We design the platform, offerings, and policies to facilitate compliance with evolving privacy and data security laws and regulations. We post privacy policies online and maintain certain other internal policies and practices relating to data security and concerning processing, use, and disclosure of personal information. We collect and use aggregated, end-user information to develop, provide, and improve our platform and offerings.
Our publication of the privacy policy and other statements regarding privacy and security may subject us to investigation or enforcement actions by federal, state, and international regulators if they are found to be deficient, lacking transparency, deceptive, or misrepresentative of the practices. We also may be bound from time to time by contractual obligations related to our collection and use of certain personally identifiable information.
The privacy and data security laws and regulations to which we are subject, as well as their interpretation, are evolving and expected to continue to change over time. We continue to monitor the current landscape of privacy and security laws, as well as pending and emerging legislation, in both U.S. state and federal jurisdictions and abroad. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted in additional jurisdictions (such as enacted state privacy laws in California, Virginia, and Colorado, for example), and certain proposals, if adopted, could harm our business through a decrease in registrations and revenues, or through a change in marketing strategies; however, a federal data privacy and security standard, which is also a possibility, may provide substantial clarity and benefits for businesses that collect and maintain such data.
Other privacy and data security laws and regulations to which we may be subject include emerging state legislation, COPPA, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, TCPA, and Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Additionally, the Company may be subject to foreign privacy and data protection requirements including the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act 2018, European General Data Protection and Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. More generally, the various privacy and data security legal obligations that apply to us may evolve in a manner that relates to our practices or the features of our mobile applications or websites. We may need to take additional measures to comply with the new and evolving legal obligations and to maintain and improve the information security posture in an effort to avoid information security incidents or breaches affecting personal information or other sensitive or proprietary data.
For additional information regarding the impact of data privacy and security on our business, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to the business. We rely on trademarks, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to the platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the U.S. and other countries to the extent it is determined to be appropriate and cost-effective. As of February 14, 2023, we have several registered and pending trademarks in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, we have common law rights in some trademarks in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, as well as many registered copyrights in the U.S. We also have numerous registered domain names for websites that are used in the business, such as www.nerdy.com, and the businesses of the subsidiary entities, such as www.varsitytutors.com, and other businesses and their respective variations.
We continue to evaluate and act upon additional intellectual property protections to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective to do so. Despite efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report.
