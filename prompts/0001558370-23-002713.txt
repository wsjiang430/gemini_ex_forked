Item 1. Business

Nutex Health Inc. (“Nutex Health” or the “Company”) is a physician-led, healthcare services and operations company with 19 hospital facilities in eight states (hospital division), and a primary care-centric, risk-bearing population health management division. Our hospital division implements and operates innovative health care models, including micro-hospitals, specialty hospitals and hospital outpatient departments (“HOPDs”). The population health management division owns and operates provider networks such as independent physician associations (“IPAs”) and offers a cloud-based proprietary technology platform to IPAs which aggregates clinical and claims data across multiple settings, information systems and sources to create a holistic view of patients and providers.
​
We employ 1,150 full- and part-time employees and partner with over 800 physicians. Our corporate headquarters is based in Houston, Texas. We were incorporated on April 13, 2000 in the state of Delaware.
​
Merger of Nutex Health Holdco LLC and Clinigence Holdings, Inc. On April 1, 2022, the merger (the “Merger”) of Nutex Health Holdco LLC and Clinigence Holdings, Inc. (“Clinigence”) was completed pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) entered on November 23, 2021 between Clinigence, Nutex Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Clinigence, Nutex, Micro Hospital Holding LLC (solely for the purposes of certain sections of the Merger Agreement), Nutex Health Holdco LLC and Thomas Vo, M.D., solely in his capacity as the representative of the equity holders of Nutex Health Holdco LLC.
​
In connection with the Merger Agreement, Nutex Health Holdco LLC entered into certain Contribution Agreements with holders of equity interests (“Nutex Owners”) of subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Nutex Subsidiaries”) pursuant to which such Nutex Owners agreed to contribute certain equity interests in the Nutex Subsidiaries to Nutex Health Holdco LLC in exchange for specified equity interests in Nutex Health Holdco LLC (collectively, the “Contribution Transaction”). Nutex owners having ownership interests representing approximately 84% of the agreed upon aggregate equity value of the Nutex Subsidiaries agreed to contribute all or a portion of their equity interests, as applicable.
​
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each unit representing an equity interest in Nutex Health Holdco LLC issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger but after the Contribution Transaction (collectively, the “Nutex Membership Interests”) was converted into the right to receive 3.571428575 shares of common stock of Clinigence, or an aggregate of 592,791,712 shares of common stock of Clinigence.
​
Potential Future Stock Issuances. Under the terms of the Contribution Agreements, contributing owners of the under construction hospitals and ramping hospitals are eligible to receive a one-time additional issuance of Company common stock. 
​

● | With respect to ramping hospitals, 24 months after the opening date (the “Determination Date”) of the applicable ramping hospital, such owner is eligible to receive such owner’s pro rata share of a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to (a)(i) the trailing twelve months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on the respective Determination Date, multiplied by (ii) 10, (iii) minus the initial equity value received at the Closing of the Merger, and (iv) minus such owner’s pro rata share of the aggregate debt of the applicable ramping hospital outstanding as of the closing of the Merger. The number of additional shares to be issued will be determined based on the greater of (a) the price of the Company’s common stock at the time of determination or (b) $2.80.

any option or contract purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose of their shares of Company common stock received in the merger or (ii) enter into any swap or other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such shares.
​
The lock-up restrictions terminated with respect to one-third of the shares of Company Common Stock on October 1, 2022. The lock-up restrictions terminate for the remaining shares on April 1, 2023 (one-third) and October 1, 2023 (final one-third).
​
Registration rights agreement. In September 2022, we filed a registration statement pursuant to a registration rights agreement dated as of April 1, 2022 and amended effective as of July 1, 2022, to register for resale one-third of the shares of Company common stock issued in the merger that were released from lockup restrictions on October 1, 2022. The registration rights agreement terminates on the earlier of (i) when the shares may be sold under Rule 144 without any restrictions or (ii) the dissolution or liquidation of the Company.
​
Operating Segments
​
We report the results of our operations as three segments: (i) the hospital division, (ii) the population health management (PHM) division and (ii) the real estate division. 
​
Hospital Division. Our hospital division develops and operates a network of micro-hospitals, specialty hospitals and hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) providing comprehensive and high-quality 24/7 care. Our full-service care delivery model provides concierge-level care traditionally ‎offered by larger hospitals in a ‎patient-friendly and cost-effective setting. We provide a ‎full spectrum of healthcare services, including ‎emergency room care, inpatient care, and ‎behavioral health, and offer a complementary suite of ancillary ‎services, including onsite ‎imaging (CT scan, X-ray, MRI, ultrasound, etc.), certified and accredited laboratories, ‎and onsite ‎inpatient pharmacies. We own and operate 19 ‎healthcare facilities across eight ‎states and have an additional 17 de novo micro-hospitals under ‎development.
​
Our micro-hospitals generate revenue from both emergency services and in-patient services, providing operating leverage and high earning potential of each facility. We believe that wait times are significantly lower than traditional ER settings and patients are welcomed by a friendly, attentive staff and physician team. Our hospital division generally operates as an out-of-‎network provider and, as such, does not have negotiated reimbursement rates with insurance ‎companies. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we signed in-network provider contracts with the Provider Network of America (PNA). These contracts provide for payment to us of claims at 300% of the Medicare allowable rates for our services provided to PNA members.
​
When developing new hospitals, we provide a turn-key process from location selection, real estate design, ‎and development of the facility to staffing, training and operations. Our management and administrative teams provide a comprehensive suite of ‎operational and managerial services to hospitals, including management, billing, collections, recruiting ‎and marketing. Our licensed micro-hospitals average approximately 13 thousand feet and include seven to eight emergency treatment rooms, two to ten in-patient beds for short-term stays and advanced imaging equipment. Our staffing at each facility includes four to ten physicians and hospitalists depending on the community’s needs.
​
Most of our hospitals have contractual relationships with separately owned professional entities (the “Physician LLCs”) and real estate entities (the “Real Estate Entities”). The Physician LLCs employ the doctors who work in our hospitals. ‎The ‎Real Estate Entities own the land and ‎hospital buildings in ‎which the hospitals operate and lease the buildings ‎to the hospitals. We have no ownership interests in either the Physician LLCs or Real Estate Entities, but provide back office accounting for each. Many of these entities are owned in part, and in some cases, controlled by related parties including members of our executive management team.
​
The Physician LLCs are consolidated by the Company as variable interest entities (VIEs) because they do not have significant equity at risk, and we have historically provided support to the Physician LLCs in the event of cash shortages and received the benefit of their cash surpluses.
​
Population Health Division. Our population health management division establishes and operates independent physician associations (IPAs) and offers a cloud-based platform for healthcare organizations to provide value-based care and population health management. 
​
An IPA is a business entity organized and owned by a network of independent physician practices. Once established, the IPA enrolls patients and negotiates managed care contracts with insurers to provide comprehensive care to their patients typically for a value-based fixed annual fee (capitation). The IPA entities are not owned by us but are managed by our management services organization 

2



(MSO) which provides management, administrative, and other support services. Presently, we manage one IPA located in Los Angeles, California having over 22,000 patients. We have established two other IPAs, in Houston and in South Florida, and are actively contracting with primary care physicians and specialists. Once this phase is completed, we expect to contract with health insurance plans and start enrolling patients in 2023. We also anticipate forming another IPA in 2023 in Phoenix, Arizona. We consolidate the IPA entities in our financial statements as VIEs since we manage these entities.
​
We also provided limited services to one health maintenance organization (“HMO”) and two other IPAs in Southern and Northern California.
​
Our cloud-based technology is offered by Clinigence Health, Inc. Our proprietary cloud-based PHM platform aggregates data across multiple groups of information, which it then uses to report clinical quality measures, gaps in care, risk-stratification of patients, predictive analytics as well as providing a scorecard and utilization dashboard on every provider. This platform provides SaaS solutions that enable connected intelligence across the care continuum by transforming massive amounts of data into actionable insights. Our solutions help healthcare organizations improve the quality and cost effectiveness of care, enhance population health management and optimize provider networks.
​
Real Estate Division. The Real Estate Entities own the land and hospital buildings which are leased to our hospital entities. The Real Estate Entities have mortgage loans payable to third parties which are collateralized by the land and buildings. We consolidate the Real Estate Entities as VIEs in instances where our hospital entities are guarantors or co-borrowers under their outstanding mortgage loans. During the second quarter of 2022, we deconsolidated 17 Real Estate Entities after the third-party lenders released our guarantees of associated mortgage loans, leaving three Real Estate Entities as current VIEs consolidated in our financial statements.
​
Sources of Revenue
​
The following table shows revenue for each of our operating segments:
​

Total revenue | ​ | $ | 219,294,306 | ​ | $ | 331,531,311 | ​ | $ | 274,029,061

​
Our hospital division receives payment for facility services rendered by us from federal agencies, private insurance carriers, and patients. The Physician LLCs receive payment for doctor services from these same sources. On average, greater than 90% of our net patient service revenue is paid by insurers, federal agencies, and other non-patient third parties. The remaining revenues are paid by our patients in the form of copays, deductibles, and self-payment. As noted, we generally operate as an out-of-‎network provider and, as such, do not have negotiated reimbursement rates with insurance ‎companies. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we signed in-network provider contracts with the Provider Network of America (PNA). These contracts provide for payment to us of claims at 300% of the Medicare allowable rates for our services provided to PNA members.
​
The population health management division recognizes revenue for capitation and management fees for services to IPAs and physician groups and for the licensing, training, and consulting related to our cloud-based proprietary technology. Capitation revenue consists primarily of capitated fees for medical services provided by physician-owned entities we consolidate as VIEs. Capitated arrangements are made directly with various managed care providers including HMOs. Capitation revenues are typically prepaid monthly to us based on the number of enrollees selecting us as their healthcare provider. Capitation is a fixed payment amount per patient per unit of time paid in advance for the delivery of health care services, whereby the service providers are generally liable for excess medical costs. We receive management fees that are based on gross capitation revenues of the IPAs or physician groups we manage.

Our Strategy

Our mission is to make exceptional concierge-level healthcare more accessible to communities. Our business strategy is to increase stockholder value through sustained earnings growth and cash flow generation by:
​

• | Developing and operating innovative micro-hospitals – We currently operate 19 micro-hospital facilities in eight states and one IPA. We plan to grow our operations by expanding our innovative micro-hospital model into several more states and developing IPAs which leverage our presence and physician relationships in each community we serve.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Providing a patient-centric care model – We fulfill an underserved healthcare segment needing immediate and convenient access to primary and emergency care. Producing a compelling work environment for physicians and hospitalists helps us deliver superior patient experiences and clinical outcomes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Offering a differentiated provider engagement and partnership strategy – Having high satisfaction and retention rates of physicians helps us in delivering superior patient experiences. Financially, we are aligned with our physician partners who are co-investors with us in their community’s micro-hospitals or IPAs and, in many instances, are shareholders of Nutex. Our relationships with physician partners are critical to our success.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Having a scalable go-to-market strategy – Robust administrative support where key support functions including billing and collection, purchasing, marketing, human resources and financial operations are centralized allowing our physicians and hospitalists to focus on patient care. Building out IPA networks in the same communities as our micro-hospitals will drive patient volume and result in greater revenue from increased capitation and full-risk contracts. To complement our organic growth plans, we may, in the normal course of business, consider and review opportunistic acquisitions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Our Growth Strategy

We are focused on expanding patient access to quality healthcare by opening or acquiring new micro-hospital facilities in underserved areas of the United States. We are also establishing IPAs in many of the locales where we operate micro-hospitals in order to leverage our community presence and relationships with in-market physicians. 
​
We expect to open 15 to 20 new hospital facilities by the middle of the year 2025. These facilities are either under construction or in advanced planning stages and will result in our expansion into four new states: Florida, Wisconsin, Ohio and Idaho. We anticipate launching one-to-three additional IPAs per year principally in geographic areas around our existing micro-hospitals.
​

The following map shows our existing and planned presence across the United States:

​
Our process for opening a new micro-hospital begins with identifying underserved markets. Generally, we place our micro-hospitals in larger suburban or rural locations. Before entering a new state, we investigate the regulation and licensing requirements for our business and the construction design and permitting requirements of the targeted community. We next identify and contract with in-market physicians who will co-invest with us and become the on-site management of the new facility. 
​
For each new hospital location, three entities are usually created:
​

• | Real estate entity – our hospital facilities are designed and constructed to meet our specific needs and governmental regulations for micro-hospitals. Construction of new facilities or major renovation of existing buildings to meet our specifications requires significant financial resources. In most cases, these financial resources are provided by a newly established real estate entity that is independently owned by the in-market physicians and other partners, including in many cases, members of our executive management team. The real estate entities often enter into mortgage loans to finance the facilities. In some instances, Nutex may participate as a co-borrower or guarantee of this indebtedness. Nutex does not own any of the real estate entities but enters into a long-term market rate lease of the facility for its operations with the real estate entity. Nutex also contracts with this entity to provide administrative services including financial accounting and other responsibilities.

​

• | Physician LLC entity – the in-market physicians create and independently own the physician entity. In certain states, state laws and regulations prohibit non-physician ownership of physician practices. The physician entity employs or contracts with
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

physicians who will staff the new location. We contract with the physician entities to provide administrative services including claims billing and collections, financial accounting and other responsibilities.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Hospital facility entity – Nutex typically has 70% or more equity ownership of new hospital facilities and in-market physicians usually own much of the remaining equity. The participation by in-market physicians in owning the hospital facility is a key factor in our success. The hospital facility contracts with the physician entity to provide physician staffing and enters into a lease of the physical facility with the associated real estate entity. The hospital facility provides the operating equipment and supplies and employs nursing and other staffing for local operations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Our relationships with physician partners are critical to our success. The physician partners’ financial participation through ownership in whole, or in part, of the above entities aligns our interests towards achieving common business goals and helps us have a high satisfaction and retention rate of physicians.
​
Having good physician relationships is also fundamental to our success in developing and operating IPAs. We begin development of new IPAs by identifying underserved markets. As noted previously, we are focused on launching IPAs in markets around our micro-hospitals. Doing so will leverage our existing physician relationships and increase visibility of our micro-hospitals in the marketplace. Once the physician provider network is secured, we work to contract with health insurance plans and begin enrolling patients in the new IPA.
​
We may achieve our growth strategy in part by acquiring or contracting existing healthcare facilities and IPAs.
​
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing our growth strategy. In addition to establishing and maintaining strong physician relationships, our growth strategy requires significant financial resources to equip and staff new locations, fund cash needs until the location becomes profitable and provide for working capital needs. If we are not able to successfully execute upon our growth strategies, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Competition
​
The healthcare industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented. ‎We face competition in every aspect of our business, including in offering a favorable ‎reimbursement structure for existing physician partners and attracting physician ‎partners who are not contracted with us, from a range of large and medium-sized local and ‎national companies that provide care under a variety of models that could attract patients, ‎providers, and payors. Our primary competitors are free-standing emergency departments and traditional large local hospital systems that are developing micro hospitals to increase their footprint in their local communities. Our competitors typically vary by geography, and we may also encounter ‎competition in the future from other new entrants.
​
Since there are virtually no substantial capital expenditures required for providing healthcare services, there are few financial barriers to entry in the healthcare industry. Other companies or hospital groups could enter the micro hospital market in the future and divert some, or all, of our business. Our ability to compete successfully varies from location to location and depends on a number of factors that include, but are not limited to: the number of competing facilities in the local market and the types of services available at those facilities, our local reputation for quality care of members, the commitment and expertise of our medical staff, our local service offerings and community programs, the cost of care in each locality, and the physical appearance, location, age and condition of our facilities.
​
Our growth strategy and our business could be ‎adversely affected if we are not able to continue to access existing geographies, successfully ‎expand into new geographies or maintain or establish new relationships with ‎physician partners. See “Risk Factors.” ‎
​
The principal competitive factors in our business include the nature and caliber of ‎relationships with physicians; patient healthcare quality, outcomes, and cost; the strength of ‎relationships with payors; the quality of the physician experience; local geography leadership ‎position; and the strength of the underlying economic model. We believe our business, ‎partnership and operations model enables us to compete favorably. ‎
​
The Healthcare Industry 
​
According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, national healthcare expenditures grew 9.7% in 2020 to $4.1 trillion. Federal expenditures for healthcare increased by 36% largely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic while private health 

6



insurance spending decreased 1%. CMS anticipates that total U.S. healthcare annual expenditures will reach nearly $6.2 trillion by 2028, accounting for approximately 19.7% of the total U.S. gross domestic product.
​
Hospital services, the market within the healthcare industry in which we primarily operate, is the largest single category of healthcare expenditures. In 2020, hospital care expenditures increased 6.4%, slightly faster than the growth rate of 6.3% in 2019, and totaled nearly $1.3 trillion. This growth reflected a substantial amount of funding from federal programs (including COVID-19 relief) and larger increases in Medicaid spending compared to prior years. CMS projects that the hospital services category will grow at an average of 6.0% annually from 2022 through 2028, reaching nearly $2.1 trillion by 2028.
​
The U.S. hospital industry includes acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric facilities that are either public (government owned and operated), not-for-profit private (religious or secular), or for-profit institutions (investor owned). According to the American Hospital Association, there are approximately 5,139 community hospitals in the U.S., which are not-for-profit owned, investor owned, or state or local government owned. Of these hospitals, approximately 35% are located in non-urban communities. Hospital facilities offer a broad range of healthcare services, including internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, orthopedics, OB/GYN and emergency services. In addition, hospitals offer other ancillary services, including psychiatric, diagnostic, rehabilitation, home care and outpatient surgery services.
​
Patients needing the most complex care are more often served by the larger and/or more specialized urban hospitals. We believe opportunities exist in selected markets to create micro-hospitals serving the community’s emergency needs which expand the reach of healthcare services and have less wait times for care often seen in larger hospital emergency departments. 
​
Physician and clinical services expenditures grew 5.4% to $809.5 billion in 2020, faster growth than the 4.2% in 2019. Relative spending for primary care in the U.S. is lower than that of many other developed nations. Preventative primary care is an important focus of U.S. healthcare education to consumers with the goal of improving patient care outcomes through early detection and treatment of illnesses. It also has the added benefit of reducing healthcare costs as extended hospital stays and more costly treatments may be avoided.
​
Consumers desire affordable primary care with access to specialists as needed. We believe this need may be met by offering IPAs. Our IPAs offer a trusted network of primary care physicians and specialists fostering closer patient-physician relationships. 
​
COVID-19 Pandemic
​
A novel strain of coronavirus causing the disease known as COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019 and spread throughout the world. While vaccines and booster shots for the COVID-19 virus became widely available in the United States during 2021, COVID-19 continued to result in a significant number of hospitalizations.
​
As a provider of healthcare services, we were significantly affected by the public health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our hospitals, medical personnel, and employees have been actively caring for COVID-19 patients. We implemented considerable safety measures for treatment of COVID-19 patients and have incurred, and may continue to incur, certain increased expenses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, including additional labor, supply chain, capital and other expenditures. Moreover, in recent months, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in general inflationary pressures and significant disruptions to global supply networks. In this regard, we have experienced disruptions in connection with the provision of equipment, construction services, as well as inflationary pressures in connection with labor, supply chain, capital and other expenditures. We also experienced a delay in billing and collection of patient claims during this period.
​
The COVID-19 pandemic affected, and may continue to affect, our service mix, revenue mix, payor mix and/or patient volumes, as well as our ability to collect outstanding receivables. Pandemic-related factors may continue to adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payors to pay for services rendered.
​
While we are not able to fully quantify the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our future financial results, we expect developments related to COVID-19 to continue to affect our financial performance. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic may otherwise have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial position, and/or our cash flows if economic and/or public health conditions in the United States deteriorate.

Governmental Regulation

The healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payors, our contractual relationships with our providers, vendors and clients, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular importance are:
​

• | No Surprises Act;
--+------------------


• | the federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Anti-Kickback Act;
--+-------------------------------


• | the criminal healthcare fraud provisions of HIPAA;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | the federal False Claims Act;
--+------------------------------


• | reassignment of payment rules that prohibit certain types of billing and collection;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | laws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
No Surprises Act. The No Surprises Act (“NSA”) is a federal law that took effect January 1, 2022, to protect consumers from most instances ‎of “surprise” balance billing. The legislation was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was passed ‎by Congress and signed into law by President Trump on December 27, 2020. With respect to the Company, ‎the NSA limits ‎the amount an insured patient will pay for emergency services furnished by an out-of-network ‎provider. The NSA addresses ‎the payment of these out-of-network providers by group health plans or health ‎insurance issuers (collectively, “insurers”). ‎In particular, the NSA requires insurers to reimburse out-of-network ‎providers at a statutorily calculated “out-of-network ‎rate.” In states without an all-payor model agreement or ‎specified state law, the out-of-network rate is either the amount ‎agreed to by the insurer and the out-of-network ‎provider or an amount determined through an independent dispute ‎resolution (“IDR”) process. ‎
​
Under the NSA, insurers must issue an initial payment or notice of denial of payment to a provider within ‎thirty ‎days after the provider submits a bill for an out-of-network service. If the provider disagrees with the ‎insurer’s ‎determination, the provider may initiate a thirty-day period of open negotiation with the insurer over the ‎claim. If the ‎parties cannot resolve the dispute through negotiation, the parties may then proceed to IDR ‎arbitration. ‎
​
Independent Dispute Resolution. The provider and insurer each submits a proposed payment amount and ‎‎explanation to the arbitrator. The arbitrator must select one of the two proposed payment amounts taking into ‎account the ‎‎“qualifying payment amount” and additional circumstances including among other things the level of training, outcomes ‎‎measurements of the facility, the acuity of the individual treated, and the case mix and scope of services of the ‎facility ‎providing the service. The NSA prohibits the arbitrator from considering the provider’s usual and ‎customary charges for an ‎item or service, or the amount the provider would have billed for the item or service in ‎the absence of the NSA. 
​
‎Qualifying Payment Amount. The “qualifying payment amount” (QPA) is generally the median of the contracted ‎rates ‎recognized by the plan or issuer under such plans or coverage, respectively, on January 31, 2019, for the ‎same or a similar ‎item or service that is provided by a provider in the same or similar specialty and provided in the ‎geographic region in ‎which the items or service is furnished, with annual increases based on the consumer price ‎index. In other words, the ‎qualifying payment amount is typically the median rate the insurer would have paid for ‎the service if provided by an in-‎network provider or facility.‎
​
Since the NSA became effective January 1, 2022, our average payment by insurers of patient claims for emergency services has declined by approximately 30% including as much as a 37% reduction for physician services. In our experience, insurers often initially pay amounts lower than the QPA without regard for other information relevant to the claim. This requires us to make appeals using the IDR process. We submitted almost 28 thousand cases for IDR in 2022, most in the fourth quarter. The IDR process and subsequent appeals, should we pursue them, require extensive administrative time and delays in collections. 
​
Our experience is similar to that of other healthcare providers. In February 2023, the Emergency Department Physician Management Association reported survey results of its membership. The survey found that in more than 90% of claims surveyed, insurance companies did comply with the NSA’s statutory and regulatory requirements for QPA disclosure and that the average claim payment declined 32% per ER Visit post-NSA.
​

While we are working within the established processes for IDR, we have had varying successes at achieving collections at or higher than the established QPA. We have undertaken several strategic actions designed to improve our collections results. These include:‎
​

• | ‎maximizing our claims coding efficiency,‎
--+-------------------------------------------

​
HHS Final Rule. As required by the NSA, the United States Department of Health and Human ‎Services (“HHS”) ‎has established an IDR process under which a certified IDR ‎entity determines the ultimate amount of payment. The HHS’ ‎final rule became effective October 25, 2022. 
​
The final rule is already the subject of legal challenges. The Texas Medical Association (TMA) in September of 2022 filed motions for summary judgment in the U.S. Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, seeking to invalidate the IDR related provisions of the final rule, arguing that the QPA does not represent the fair value of the services rendered by the physicians and providers and that the final rule illegally favors the QPA over the fair value of the provider services in contravention of the statutory language of the NSA.

On October 19, 2022, and in addition to amicus briefs by several other national medical associations, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and the American College of Radiology, professional associations representing an aggregate of approximately 136,000 physicians, filed an Amicus brief supporting the TMA Motion.
​
On February 6, 2023, the U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the TMA by granting its motion for summary judgment against the HHS and stating that the revised IDR process in the final rule "continues to place a thumb on the scale" in favor of insurers and conflicts with the statutory provisions of the NSA, is unlawful and must be set aside. The Courts decision vacated all of the revised regulations challenged by the TMA, including HHS’ rule that arbiters must primarily consider the QPA in the IDR process. The court stated that the final rules wrongly require arbitrators to presume the correctness of the QPA and then impose a heightened burden on the remaining statutory factors to overcome that presumption. In addition, the TMA on January 1, 2023, also in the U.S. Eastern District, filed a lawsuit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to invalidate a recent 600% percent increase in the administrative fees payable in the IDR process.
​
We are supportive of industry efforts challenging NSA. Our experience, like that of many other healthcare providers, is that the final rule continues to unfairly favor insurers in the determination of the QPA we receive for our healthcare services. It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of efforts to challenge or amend the final rule. As well, there can be no assurance that third-party payors will not attempt to further reduce the rates they pay for our services or that additional rules issued under the NSA will not have adverse consequences to our business.
​
Regulatory Licensing and Certification. Many states, including Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wisconsin, require regulatory approval, including licensure and certification, before establishing certain types of clinics offering certain professional and ancillary services, including the services Nutex offers. The operations of the Nutex owned and managed hospitals are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, and proof of financial ability to operate. Our ability to operate profitably depends in part on the ability of Nutex owned and managed facilities and its providers to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses and other approvals, and maintain updates to their enrollment in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including the addition of new hospital locations, providers and other enrollment information. In addition, certain ancillary services such as the provision of diagnostic laboratory testing require additional state and federal licensure and regulatory oversight, including oversight by CMS, under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, which requires all clinical laboratories to meet certain quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards, and comparable state laboratory licensing authorities. Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” Nutex owned and managed facilities hold CLIA Certificates of Waiver and perform certain CLIA-waived tests, which subjects such clinics to certain CLIA requirements. Sanctions for failure to comply with 

9



applicable state and federal licensing, certification and other regulatory requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of the applicable authorization, significant fines and penalties and/or an inability to receive reimbursement from government healthcare programs and other third-party payors.
​
Nutex’ providers must meet minimum requirements to apply for participation or continued participation with Nutex through a credentialing process, including, without limitation, having a valid, current medical license and DEA registration, if required for the provider’s scope of practice, the absence of any debarment, suspension, exclusion or other restriction from receiving payments from any government or other third-party payor program, and clearing National Practitioner Data Bank of any reports and/or disciplinary actions. Nutex’ credentialing program is designed to meet CMS and the National Committee for Quality Assurance, or NCQA, credentialing requirements as well as applicable federal and state laws. Providers are generally recredentialed every three years or more often if necessary, which is consistent with industry guidelines. In addition, network providers are required under their participating provider agreements with Nutex to have established an ongoing quality assurance program. Moreover, Nutex’ contracts may allow Nutex to withhold compensation from time to time based upon the providers meeting certain quality metrics, including HEDIS quality measures and care coordination metrics. 
​
State Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Our arrangements with our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners are subject to various state laws, commonly referred to as corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting laws, which are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment and prohibiting the sharing of professional service fees with non-professional or business interests. These laws vary from state to state, including those where the Company does business, and are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators.
A determination of non-compliance against us and/or our affiliated professional entities or other physician partners based on the reinterpretation of existing laws or adoption of new laws could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, and/or restructuring of these arrangements. 
​
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws. We are subject to a number of federal and state healthcare regulatory laws that restrict certain business practices in the healthcare industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, self-referral and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws. 
​
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
​
Several courts have interpreted the AKS’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the AKS has been violated. 
​
The AKS includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. By way of example, the AKS safe harbor for value-based arrangements and the safe harbor for arrangements between managed care organizations and downstream contractors both require, among other things, that the arrangement does not induce a person or entity to reduce or limit medically necessary items or services furnished to any patient. Failure to meet the requirements of an applicable AKS safe harbor, however, does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances, including the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse, and may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.
​
The Stark Law prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship, or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities providing designated health services, or DHS, from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to such entities for the furnishing of DHS, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from billing for any such prohibited referral. Unlike the AKS, the Stark Law is violated if the financial arrangement does not meet an applicable exception, regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. 
​
The Federal False Claims Act, or FCA, prohibits a person from knowingly presenting, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or from making a false statement or using a false record to have a claim approved. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the United States government. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the AKS or the Stark Law constitutes a 

10



false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Penalties for a violation of the FCA include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim. Private individuals also have the ability to bring actions under these false claims’ laws in the name of the government alleging false and fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, known as qui tam actions, are pervasive in the healthcare industry. 
​
Further, the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments, and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to offering remuneration to a federal health care program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive health care items or services from a particular provider. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the AKS and civil FCA. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The HHS’ Office of Inspector General emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payors may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud. 
​
HIPAA also established federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
​
Several states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud and abuse laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any payor, including patients and commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program.
​
Violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative civil and criminal penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, additional reporting requirements and compliance oversight obligations, in the event that a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement is required to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and/ or individual imprisonment. 
​
Healthcare Reform. In the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system, many of which are intended to contain or reduce healthcare costs. By way of example, in the United States, the ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA required, among other things, CMS to establish a Medicare shared savings program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of ACOs. The Medicare shared savings program allows for providers, physicians and other designated health care professionals and suppliers to form ACOs and voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to give coordinated high-quality care to their Medicare patients, avoid unnecessary duplication of services and prevent medical errors. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by CMS are eligible to share in a portion of the Medicare program’s cost savings. ACO program methodologies and participation requirements are updated by CMS for each performance year and participants are expected to comply with such program requirements and required to report on performance after the close of the year. ACOs that fail to comply with such program requirements can face penalties or even termination of their participation in the Medicare shared savings program. 
​
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021, through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA or our business. 
​

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
​
Additionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation continues to test an array of value-based alternative payment models, including the Global and Professional Direct Contracting Model to allow Direct Contracting Entities to negotiate directly with the government to manage traditional Medicare beneficiaries and share in the savings and risks generated from managing such beneficiaries. Although we currently do not participate in these pilot payment models, we may choose to do so in the future. Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which first affected physician payment in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the Medicare quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement. In addition, there likely will continue to be regulatory proposals directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, as government healthcare programs and other third-party payors transition from FFS to value-based reimbursement models, which can include risk-sharing, bundled payment and other innovative approaches. It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement additional reductions, increases, or changes in reimbursement in the future under government programs that may adversely affect us or increase the cost of providing our services. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue or attain growth, any of which could have a material impact on our business.
​
Further, healthcare providers and industry participants are also subject to a growing number of requirements intended to promote the interoperability and exchange of patient health information. For example, on April 5, 2021, healthcare providers and certain other entities became subject to information blocking restrictions pursuant to the Cures Act that prohibit practices that are likely to interfere with the access, exchange or use of electronic health information, except as required by law or specified by the HHS as a reasonable and necessary activity. Violations may result in penalties or other disincentives. It is unclear at this time what the costs of compliance with the new rules will be, and what additional risks there may be to our business. 
​
Data Privacy and Security Laws. We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, including health information privacy and security laws, data breach notification laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act). For example, HIPAA imposes obligations on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, such as the affiliated professional entities, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, as well as their covered subcontractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA, whether as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. 
​
In addition, certain state laws, such as the CMIA, the CCPA, and the CPRA, govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
​
Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. 
​
Federal and State Insurance and Managed Care Laws. Regulation of downstream risk-sharing arrangements, including, but not limited to, at-risk and other value-based arrangements, varies significantly from state to state. Some states require downstream entities and risk-bearing entities to obtain an insurance license, a certificate of authority, or an equivalent authorization, in order to participate in downstream risk-sharing arrangements with payors. In some states, statutes, regulations and/or formal guidance explicitly address whether and in what manner the state regulates the transfer of risk by a payor to a downstream entity. However, the majority of states do not explicitly address the issue, and in such states, regulators may nonetheless interpret statutes and regulations to regulate such 

12



activity. If downstream risk-sharing arrangements are not regulated directly in a particular state, the state regulatory agency may nonetheless require oversight by the licensed payor as the party to such a downstream risk-sharing arrangement. Such oversight is accomplished via contract and may include the imposition of reserve requirements, as well as reporting obligations. Further, state regulatory stances regarding downstream risk-sharing arrangements can change rapidly and codified provisions may not keep pace with evolving risk-sharing mechanisms and other new value-based reimbursement models. Certain of the states where we currently operate or may choose to operate in the future regulate the operations and financial condition of risk bearing organizations like us and our affiliated providers.
​
Employees

We had 1,150 full- and part-time employees as of December 31, 2022, including our named executive officers. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages related to labor relation issues. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
