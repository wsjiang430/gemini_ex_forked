ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
OUR BUSINESS
ONE Gas, Inc. is incorporated under the laws of the state of Oklahoma. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol “OGS,” and is included in the S&P MidCap 400 Index. We are a 100-percent regulated natural gas distribution utility, headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and one of the largest publicly traded natural gas utilities in the United States. We are successor to the company founded in 1906 as Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, which became ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) in 1980. On January 31, 2014, ONE Gas officially separated from ONEOK.
We provide natural gas distribution services to our 2.2 million customers and are the largest natural gas distributor in Oklahoma and Kansas and the third largest in Texas, in terms of customers. We serve residential, commercial and industrial, transportation and wholesale, and public authority customers in all three states. Our largest natural gas distribution markets in terms of customers are Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Kansas City, Wichita and Topeka, Kansas; and Austin and El Paso, Texas. Our three divisions, Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service, distribute natural gas to approximately 88 percent, 72 percent and 13 percent of the natural gas distribution customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas, respectively.
OUR STRATEGY
Our mission is to deliver natural gas for a better tomorrow. Our vision is to be a premier natural gas distribution company, creating exceptional value for all stakeholders. Our business strategy is focused on operating our systems in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manner and growing our business strategically, while delivering quality customer service. We believe this will enable us to generate a competitive total return for our shareholders and maintain our financial stability, leading to our strategic goals of zero harm, a fair return and satisfied customers. 
We intend to accomplish our objectives by executing on the following strategies: 

• | Focus on Safety, Reliability and Compliance - We are committed, first and foremost, to pursuing a zero-incident safety and 100-percent compliance culture through programs, procedures, policies, guidelines and other internal controls designed to mitigate risk and incidents that may harm our employees, contractors, customers, the public or the environment. Additionally, a significant portion of our capital spending is focused on the safety, integrity, reliability and efficiency of our natural gas distribution system. We are committed to compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations. 


• | High-performing Workforce - The foundation of our company is our employees. Our success begins with our people and a commitment to attracting, selecting, retaining and developing a high-performing, ethical workforce where every employee understands that they can and do make a difference. We embrace an inclusive and diverse culture that encourages collaboration. We expect a high standard of performance from our employees and encourage our workforce to measure their productivity and be accountable for the best work possible. Each day that we do our best to safely, efficiently and ethically meet the needs of our customers is a day that leads to individual success and, ultimately, the success of the company. 


• | Increase Our Achieved ROE - We continually seek to increase our achieved ROE through improved operational performance, regulatory mechanisms and incremental revenues. The difference between our achieved and allowed ROE is related primarily to regulatory lag. We make investments that increase our rate base and we incur increases in our costs that are above the amounts reflected in the rates we charge for our service. 

We continue to leverage technology to improve our operational performance. Ongoing initiatives to expand the use of technology in key areas of operations and customer service are expected to result in increased customer satisfaction and efficiency, thereby helping reduce the rate of increasing expenses. 
Our focus on credit metrics and maintaining a balanced approach to capital management are significant objectives in providing reasonable rates to customers while also providing a fair return to shareholders.  We believe that maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is prudent for our business as we seek to access the capital markets to finance capital investments. As a 100-percent regulated utility, we intend to maintain strong credit metrics while we 
5

pursue a balanced approach to capital investment and a return of capital to shareholders via a dividend that we believe will be competitive with our peer group. 

• | Advocate Constructive Relationships with Key Stakeholders - We plan to continue our constructive, transparent relationships with our key stakeholders, which include our customers, employees, investors, legislators and regulators. Our strategy includes meeting the needs of our customers through the delivery of safe and reliable natural gas service while seeking outcomes in future rate proceedings that provide recovery of our costs and a fair return on our infrastructure investments. 


• | Identify and Pursue Growth Opportunities - Our growth opportunities are a result of capital investments related to the safety and reliability of our existing system, as identified by our system integrity program, in addition to system expansion related to the economic and population growth in our service territories. As a result of our commitment to enhance the integrity, reliability and safety of our existing infrastructure, we are making significant investments in our existing system, which we expect to further grow our rate base. In addition, as some of our service territories continue to experience economic growth, we expect to grow our rate base through capital investments in new service lines and main line extensions, predominately in the seven major metropolitan areas we serve. 

We believe the competitiveness of natural gas is increasing, creating new market opportunities for natural gas as an energy source within our existing service territories. Our emphasis on safety and a satisfying customer service experience makes our business an important part of the communities we serve. Natural gas remains positioned within the United States energy economy to support sustainable growth opportunities, energy independence and national security. 
We remain committed to maintaining our status as a 100-percent regulated natural gas utility. We will, however, follow a disciplined financial and operational approach to evaluating both strategic acquisition opportunities and continued investments in our existing rate base. 
REGULATORY OVERVIEW
We are subject to the regulations and oversight of the state and local regulatory authorities of the territories in which we operate. Rates and charges for natural gas distribution services are established by the OCC for Oklahoma Natural Gas and by the KCC for Kansas Gas Service. Texas Gas Service is subject to regulatory oversight by the various incorporated cities that it serves, which have primary jurisdiction for their respective service areas. Rates in unincorporated areas of Texas and all appellate matters are subject to regulatory oversight by the RRC. These regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that the utilities in their jurisdictions provide safe and reliable service at a reasonable cost, while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a fair and reasonable return on their investments. 
Generally, our rates and charges are established in rate case proceedings. Regulatory authorities may also approve mechanisms that allow for adjustments for specific costs or investments made between rate cases. Due to the nature of the regulatory process, there is an inherent lag between the time that we make investments or incur additional costs and the setting of new rates and/or charges to recover those investments or costs. Additionally, we are not allowed recovery of certain costs we incur. 
The following provides additional detail on the regulatory mechanisms in the jurisdictions we serve.
Oklahoma - Oklahoma Natural Gas currently operates under a PBRC mechanism, which provides for streamlined annual rate reviews between rate cases and includes adjustments for incremental capital investment and allowed expenses. Under this mechanism, we have an authorized ROE of 9.5 percent, with a 100 basis point dead-band of 9 to 10 percent. If our achieved ROE is below 9 percent, our base rates are increased upon OCC approval to an amount necessary to restore the ROE to 9.5 percent. If our achieved ROE exceeds 10 percent, the portion of the earnings that exceeds 10 percent is shared with our customers, who receive the benefit of 75 percent of those earnings. We receive the benefit of the remaining 25 percent. Oklahoma Natural Gas is required to file a rate case on or before June 30, 2021, based on a test year consisting of the twelve months ending December 31, 2020. Other regulatory mechanisms in Oklahoma include the following: 

• | Rate Design for Residential Customers - Oklahoma Natural Gas has an authorized rate structure providing customers with two rate choices. Rate Choice “A” is designed for customers whose annual normalized volume is less than 50 Dth. These customers pay a fixed monthly service charge and a per Dth delivery fee. Although a portion of the delivery charges for customers in Rate Choice “A” is dependent on usage, these customers use relatively small quantities of natural gas and therefore the delivery charge that is dependent on usage is not significant. The fixed monthly residential customer charge is $15.77, with a delivery fee of $4.1143 per Dth for these customers. Rate 

6

Choice “B” is designed for customers whose annual normalized volume is 50 Dth or greater. These customers pay a fixed monthly service charge of $32.91, with no delivery fee. At December 31, 2018, 71 percent of Oklahoma Natural Gas’ residential customers were on Rate Choice “B.” 

• | Rate Design for Commercial and Industrial Customers - Oklahoma Natural Gas is authorized to provide two different rate choices for its Small Commercial and Industrial, or SCI, customers. Rate Choice “A” is designed for SCI customers whose annual normalized volume is less than 40 Dth. These customers pay both a fixed monthly service charge of $21.65 and a delivery fee of $4.5599 per Dth. Rate Choice “B” is designed for SCI customers whose annual normalized volume is 40 Dth or greater but less than 150 Dth. These customers pay a fixed monthly service charge of $36.85, with no delivery fee. All of Oklahoma Natural Gas’ Large Commercial and Industrial, or LCI, customers, whose annual volume is 150 Dth or greater, but less than 5,000 Dth, pay a fixed monthly service charge of $88.92. At December 31, 2018, 80 percent of Oklahoma Natural Gas’ commercial and industrial customers were on either SCI Rate Choice “B” or LCI. 


• | PGA Clause - Oklahoma Natural Gas’ commodity, transportation, storage and gas purchase operations and maintenance costs are passed through to its sales customers, without profit, via the PGA. Any costs associated with natural gas that is lost, used or unaccounted for in operations and the fuel-related portion of bad debts are also recovered through the PGA. 


• | TAC - The TAC is a weather normalization mechanism designed to reduce the delivery charge component of customers’ bills for the additional volumes used when actual HDDs exceed normalized HDDs and to increase the delivery charge component of customers’ bills for volumes not used when actual HDDs are less than the normal HDDs. Normalized HDDs established through our most recent rate proceeding are based on 10-year weighted average HDDs as of December 31, 2014, for years 2005-2014, as calculated using 11 weather stations across Oklahoma and weighted on average customer count for Oklahoma. The TAC is in effect from November through April. 


• | Energy Efficiency Programs - Oklahoma Natural Gas has energy efficiency programs, available to all sales customers. The costs associated with these programs and an incentive to offer these programs are recovered through a monthly surcharge on customer bills. Oklahoma Natural Gas collects approximately $15.4 million each year from sales customers to fund the programs, which provides rebates for energy-efficient natural gas appliances. 


• | CNG Rebate Program - The CNG rebate program is designed to promote and support the CNG market in the state of Oklahoma by offering rebates to Oklahoma residents and companies who purchase dedicated and bi-fueled natural gas vehicles or install residential CNG fueling stations. The rebates are funded by a $0.25 per gasoline gallon equivalent surcharge that Oklahoma Natural Gas is authorized to collect on fuel purchased from publicly accessible CNG dispensers owned by Oklahoma Natural Gas. Collections from the surcharge to fund the program were not material in 2018. 

For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 86 percent of Oklahoma Natural Gas’ Net Margin from its sales customers was recovered from fixed charges.
Kansas - Kansas Gas Service files periodic rate cases with the KCC as needed to increase base rates to reflect Kansas Gas Service’s authorized revenue requirement. Other regulatory mechanisms in Kansas include the following: 

• | COGR and ACA - These mechanisms allow Kansas Gas Service to recover the actual cost of the natural gas it sells to its customers. The COGR includes a monthly estimate of the cost Kansas Gas Service incurs in transporting, storing and purchasing natural gas supply for its sales customers, the ACA and other charges and credits. The ACA is an annual component of the COGR that compares the cost of gas recovered through the COGR for the preceding year with the actual natural gas supply costs and the fuel-related portion of bad debts for the same period. Any over- or under-recovery is reflected in the subsequent year’s COGR. 


• | WNA Clause - In 2016, the WNA Clause required Kansas Gas Service to accrue the variation in delivery charges resulting from actual weather differing from normal weather occurring from November through March. Beginning in April 2017, the WNA mechanism requires an accrual each month of the year. The WNA is designed to reduce the delivery charge component of customers’ bills for the additional volumes used when actual HDDs exceed normalized HDDs and to increase the delivery charge component of customers’ bills for the reduction in volumes used when actual HDDs are less than normal HDDs. Normal HDDs are established through rate proceedings and are based on a 30-year average for years 1981-2010 published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as calculated using four weather stations across Kansas and weighted on HDDs by weather station and customers for Kansas. Annually, the amount of the adjustment is determined and is then applied to customers’ bills over the subsequent 12-month period. 


• | ATSR - This rider requires Kansas Gas Service to recover the difference each year between the property tax costs included in its base rates and its actual property tax costs incurred without having to file a rate case. The amount of 

7

the adjustment is determined annually and recovered over the subsequent 12 months as a change in the delivery charge component of customers’ bills. 

• | Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits Trackers - These trackers require Kansas Gas Service to track and defer for recovery in its next rate case the difference between the pension and other postemployment benefit costs included in base rates and actual expense as determined in accordance with GAAP.


• | MGP Remediation Expense Tracker - This tracker allows Kansas Gas Service to record and defer for recovery expenses incurred after January 1, 2017, related to MGP site remediation. Kansas Gas Service is allowed to seek recovery of its costs within a general rate case application. In the first such rate case application, approved MGP costs will be amortized over 15 years. 


• | GSRS - This surcharge allows Kansas Gas Service to file for a rate adjustment providing a recovery of and return on qualifying infrastructure investments incurred between rate case filings, including all investments to replace, upgrade or modernize obsolete facilities, as well as projects that enhance the integrity of pipeline system components or extend the useful life of such assets. Safety-related investments also include expenditures for physical and cyber security. The filing cannot occur more often than once every 12 months and the rate adjustment cannot increase the monthly charge by more than $0.80 per residential customer per month compared with the most recent GSRS filing. After five annual filings, Kansas Gas Service is required to file a rate case or cease collection of the surcharge. 

The fixed monthly residential customer charge for Kansas Gas Service was $16.70, and for the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 54 percent of Kansas Gas Service’s Net Margin from its sales customers was recovered from fixed charges. 
Texas - Texas Gas Service has grouped its customers into six service areas. These service areas are further divided into the incorporated cities and the unincorporated areas, referred to as the environs. The incorporated cities in the service areas have original jurisdiction, with the RRC having appellate authority, and the RRC has original jurisdiction for the environs. Periodic rate cases are filed with the cities or the RRC, as needed, to increase rates to reflect the respective service area’s authorized revenue requirement. Other regulatory mechanisms and constructs in Texas include the following: 

• | GRIP Statute - For the incorporated cities in three of the service areas and for the environs in all six service areas, comprising 81 percent of Texas Gas Service’s customers, Texas Gas Service makes an annual filing under the GRIP statute, which allows it to recover taxes and depreciation and to earn a return on the annual net increase in investment for the service area. After five annual GRIP filings, Texas Gas Service is required to file a full rate case. A full rate case may be filed at shorter intervals if desired by either Texas Gas Service or the regulator. 


• | COSA Filings - In three of the service areas, comprising 19 percent of its customers, Texas Gas Service makes an annual COSA filing for the incorporated cities. COSA tariffs permit Texas Gas Service to recover return, taxes and depreciation on the annual increases in net investment, as well as annual increases or decreases in certain expenses and revenues. The COSAs have a cap of 3.25 percent to 5 percent on the expense portion of the increase. A full rate case may be filed when desired by Texas Gas Service or the regulator, but is not required. 


• | WNA Clause - Texas Gas Service employs WNA clauses in all six service areas. The WNA clause is designed to reduce the delivery charge component of customers’ bills for the additional volumes used when actual HDDs exceed normalized HDDs and to increase the delivery charge component of customers’ bills for the reduction in volumes used when actual HDDs are less than normal HDDs. Normal HDDs are established through rate proceedings in each of our service areas and are generally based on a 10-year average of HDDs in each service area. The WNA clause is in effect from September through May. 


• | COG Clause - In all service areas, Texas Gas Service recovers 100 percent of its natural gas costs, including transportation and storage costs, interest on natural gas in storage and the natural gas cost component of bad debts, subject to a limitation of 5 percent on lost-and-unaccounted-for natural gas. Annually, natural gas costs recovered through the COG are compared with actual natural gas supply costs. Any over- or under-recovery is refunded or recovered, as applicable, in the subsequent year. 


• | Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits - Texas Gas Service is authorized by statute to defer pension and other postemployment benefit costs that exceed the amount recovered in base rates and to seek recovery of the deferred costs in a future rate case.


• | Pipeline-Integrity Testing Riders - Texas Gas Service recovers 100 percent of its non-labor related pipeline-integrity testing expenses via riders.


• | Safety-Related Plant Replacements - Texas Gas Service is authorized by RRC rule to defer interest cost, taxes and depreciation expense on safety-related plant replacements from the time the replacements are in service until the plant is reflected in base rates, and to seek recovery of those accrued amounts in a future rate proceeding.


• | Energy Conservation Programs - Texas Gas Service has energy conservation programs in the incorporated cities of our Central Texas and Rio Grande Valley service areas, comprising 46 percent of total customers. Texas Gas Service collects approximately $3.5 million per year from customers to fund the programs, which provide energy audits, weatherization and appliance rebates to promote energy conservation.

The average fixed monthly residential customer charge for Texas Gas Service was $16.85. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 68 percent of Texas Gas Service’s Net Margin from its sales customers was recovered from fixed charges. 
MARKET CONDITIONS AND SEASONALITY
Supply - We purchased 180 Bcf and 137 Bcf of natural gas supply in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our natural gas supply portfolio consists of long-term, seasonal and short-term contracts from a diverse group of suppliers. We award these contracts through competitive-bidding processes to ensure reliable and competitively priced natural gas supply. We acquire our natural gas supply from natural gas processors, marketers and producers. 
An objective of our supply-sourcing strategy is to provide value to our customers through reliable, competitively priced and flexible natural gas supply and transportation from multiple production areas and suppliers. This strategy is designed to mitigate the impact on our supply from physical interruption, financial difficulties of a single supplier, natural disasters and other unforeseen force majeure events, as well as to ensure these resources are reliable and flexible to meet the variations of customer demands. 
We do not anticipate problems with securing natural gas supply to satisfy customer demand; however, if supply shortages were to occur, we have curtailment provisions in our tariffs that allow us to reduce or discontinue natural gas service to large industrial users and to request that residential and commercial customers reduce their natural gas requirements to an amount essential for public health and safety. In addition, during times of critical supply disruptions, curtailments of deliveries to customers with firm contracts may be made in accordance with guidelines established by appropriate federal, state and local regulatory agencies. 
Natural gas supply requirements are affected by weather conditions. In addition, economic conditions impact the requirements of our commercial and industrial customers. Natural gas usage per residential customer may decline as customers change their consumption patterns in response to a variety of factors, including: 

• | more volatile and higher natural gas prices;


• | more energy-efficient construction;


• | fuel switching from natural gas to electricity; and


• | customers improving the energy efficiency of existing homes by replacing doors and windows, adding insulation and replacing appliances with more efficient appliances.

In each jurisdiction in which we operate, changes in customer-usage profiles are considered in the periodic redesign of our rates. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 48.4 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity under contract with remaining terms ranging from one to ten years and maximum allowable daily withdrawal capacity of approximately 1.3 Bcf. This storage capacity allows us to purchase natural gas during the off-peak season and store it for use in the winter periods. This storage is also needed to assure the reliability of gas deliveries during peak demands for natural gas. Approximately 26 percent of our winter natural gas supply needs for our sales customers is expected to be supplied from storage.
In managing our natural gas supply portfolios, we partially mitigate price volatility using a combination of financial derivatives and natural gas in storage. We have natural gas financial hedging programs that have been authorized by the OCC, KCC and certain jurisdictions in Texas. We do not utilize financial derivatives for speculative purposes, nor do we have trading operations associated with our business. 
Demand - See discussion below under Seasonality, Competition and CNG for factors affecting demand for our services. 
Seasonality - Natural gas sales to residential and commercial customers are seasonal, as a substantial portion of their natural gas requirements are for heating. Accordingly, the volume of natural gas sales is higher normally during the months of November through March than in other months of the year. The impact on our margins resulting from weather temperatures that are above or below normal is offset partially through our TAC and WNA mechanisms. See discussion above under Regulatory Overview.
Competition - We encounter competition based on customers’ preference for natural gas, compared with other energy alternatives and their comparative prices. We compete primarily to supply energy for space and water heating, cooking and clothes drying. Significant energy usage competition occurs between natural gas and electricity in the residential and small 
9

commercial markets. Customers and builders typically make the decision on the type of equipment, and therefore the energy source, at initial installation, generally locking in the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. Changes in the competitive position of natural gas relative to electricity and other energy alternatives have the potential to cause a decline in consumption of natural gas or in the number of natural gas customers. 
The U.S. Department of Energy issued a statement of policy that it will use full fuel-cycle measures of energy use and emissions when evaluating energy-conservation standards for appliances. In addition, the EPA has determined that source energy is the most equitable unit for evaluating energy consumption. Assessing energy efficiency in terms of a full fuel-cycle or source-energy analysis, which takes all energy use into account, including transmission, delivery and production losses, in addition to energy consumed at the site, highlights the high overall efficiency of natural gas in residential and commercial uses compared with electricity. 
The table below contains data related to the cost of delivered gas relative to electricity based on current market conditions: 

Natural Gas vs. Electricity | Oklahoma | Kansas | Texas 
Average retail price of electricity / kWh(1) | 10.34¢ | 13.23¢ | 11.40¢
ONE Gas delivered cost of natural gas / kWh(2) | 3.16¢ | 3.15¢ | 3.76¢ 
Natural gas advantage ratio(3) | 3.3x | 4.2x | 3.0x 

(1) Source: United States Energy Information Agency, www.eia.gov, for the eleven-month period ended November 30, 2018. 
(2) Represents the average delivered cost of natural gas per kWh equivalent to a residential customer, including the cost of the natural gas supplied, fixed customer charge, delivery charges and charges for riders, surcharges and other regulatory mechanisms associated with the services we provide, for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
(3) Calculated as the ratio of the ONE Gas delivered average cost of natural gas per kWh equivalent to the average retail price of electricity per kWh. 
We are subject to competition from other pipelines for our large industrial and commercial customers, and this competition has and may continue to impact margins. Under our transportation tariffs, qualifying industrial and commercial customers are able to purchase their natural gas needs from the supplier of their choice and have us transport it for a fee. A portion of the transportation services that we provide are at negotiated rates that are below the maximum approved transportation tariff rates. Reduced-rate transportation service may be negotiated when a competitive pipeline is in close proximity or another viable energy option is available to the customer.
CNG - In meeting demand for CNG for motor vehicle transportation, particularly from fleet operators, we have continued to invest in our system to support the supply of natural gas to CNG fueling stations. As of December 31, 2018, we supply 151 fueling stations, 31 of which we operate. Of the 120 remaining stations, 68 are retail and 52 are private stations. We transported 2.9 million Dth to CNG stations in 2018, which represents an increase of 9 percent compared with 2017.
We will continue to support industry efforts to continue tax incentives for CNG. Our strategy is to support third-party investment in CNG fueling stations. We deploy a minimum amount of capital to connect CNG stations and allow the free market to build and operate the stations.
