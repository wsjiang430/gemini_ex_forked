Item 1. Description of Business
Overview
 
We were originally incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in 1972 and were previously known as SE Global Equity. In September 2005, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Sun New Media Group Limited and changed the company name to Sun New Media, Inc. In February 2006, we changed our fiscal year-end date from September 30 to March 31.
 
In April 2007, we began to operate primarily as an outsourced brand management and production center for foreign apparel brands mainly in the women’s apparel industry through William Brand Administer Co. Ltd., (“William Brand”) our core operating subsidiary.
 
In May 2007, we reincorporated into the State of Delaware and changed our name to NextMart, Inc. On October 10, 2007, we changed our fiscal year end from March 31 to September 30.
 
During fiscal year 2008, we had planned to develop an integrated online-offline direct sales platform for the ladies' apparel sector in China. However, during this time, our business and business strategy were adversely impacted in a material manner due to the appreciation of the Chinese currency (Yuan) against the US dollar (which resulted in US consumers paying higher prices for products manufactured in China), coupled with the economic malaise that affected the United States, our principal market. Accordingly, we were unable to meet our projected operating results and milestones for the various periods. The lack of operating results in turn keyed a price decline of our common stock. Due to the depressed price of our common stock together with the overall world-wide financial market turmoil, we were unable to raise the necessary funds to support our expansion strategy. Consequently in May 2008, as we have previously reported, we determined to change our business focus initially attempting to focus on the financial advisory/direct investments and we have since redirected this focus towards to the art-related industry in China.
 
In September 2008, consistent with our re-direction, we determined to divest ourselves of the William Brand’s women apparel business and other non-material businesses. In keeping that intent, on August 1, 2009, we entered into a subscription and asset sale agreement with Beijing Hua Hui Hengye Investment Lt. (“Hua Hui”), an unaffiliated PRC company. Under the terms of the agreement, we received from Hua Hui the commercial income rights to 10,000 square meters the Huadun Changde International Hotel located in the city of Changde in China’s Hunan Province (“Project”), which was under construction. Hua Hui was responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in constructing the Project. Commercial income rights included the right to receive any and all income and proceeds derived from the commercial use of the Project in any capacity. As consideration, we agreed to issue to Hua Hui 250,000,000 shares of our common stock. As additional consideration, we also transferred to Hua Hui certain non-performing or discontinued assets, none of which were our core business or material assets. However, on March 3, 2010, the Company entered into a transaction termination agreement with Hua Hui wherein both companies agreed to terminate and rescind the subscription and asset sale agreement previously entered into by the parties on August 1, 2009. All considerations received by each party under the Original agreement were returned to the issuing party.
 
On March 31, 2010, we entered into an Asset Exchange and Subscription Agreement with Ms. Wang Yihan and Beijing Chinese Art Exposition's Media Co., Ltd. (“CIGE”), a leading Chinese art services, events and media company located in Beijing, China. Ms. Wang is the sole shareholder of CIGE. The agreement was effective on March 31, 2010 and was amended on May 10. Under the amended agreement NextMart agreed to sell directly to Ms. Wang the following assets (“Transferred Assets”) (See Note 13): 1) 100% of the shares of William Brand Administer Ltd, a BVI registered company and a wholly owned subsidiary of NextMart; 100% of the shares of Credit Network 114 Limited, a BVI registered company and a wholly owned subsidiary of NextMart; 2) 100% of NextMart’s 60% shareholdings in Wuxi Sun Network Technology Ltd., a PRC registered company; 3) 100% of NextMart’s 80% shareholdings in Naixiu Exhibition Ltd., a PRC registered company; 4) the net assets of NextMart’s 100% owned subsidiary Cancer Institute of China Ltd (a BVI registered company) and its 100% owned subsidiary China Cancer Institute Beijing Ltd. (a PRC registered company). The net assets being sold do not include the subsidiaries cash, office furniture and equipment, and third party creditor’s rights and third party debts, which shall remain the subsidiaries’ property and 5) any other net assets and liabilities belonging to NextMart, with the exception of its 3,000 shares of China Grand Resorts Inc. common stock and its remaining liability under the convertible bond settlement agreement. On that same date, Ms. Wang was appointed our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

As consideration for the transfer of the above described assets, Ms. Wang agreed to transfer to NextMart certain land use rights for commercial real estate property within 24 months from date of the amended agreement. The value of the land use rights will be determined by an appraisal conducted by a licensed third party appraiser acceptable to both parties. In the PRC, there is no private land ownership. Rather, land in the PRC is owned by the government and cannot be sold to any individual or entity. The government grants or allocates landholders a “land use right,” which is sometimes referred to informally as land ownership. Land use rights are granted for specific purposes and for limited periods. Each period may be renewed at the expiration of the initial and any subsequent terms. Granted land use rights are transferable and may be used as security for borrowings and other obligations.
 
In the event Ms. Wang fails to provide land use rights for adequate real estate property within the 24 month period, she is obligated to provide NextMart with common stock of a publicly traded company acceptable to NextMart.
 
On June 22, 2010, the Company entered into an asset acquisition agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with CIGE and Ms. Wang Yihan. Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, NextMart is going to acquire from CIGE the below described assets for an agreed price of $750,000 (the “Consideration”). NextMart agreed to pay the Consideration by issuing to Ms. Wang 75,000,000 shares of its common stock. As a result of this transaction, Ms. Wang will become NextMart’s second largest shareholder with a 27.96% ownership of the company. Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, CIGE sold to NextMart the following assets (the “Assets”): 1) ownership of CIGE’s 10,000 member consumer database, 2) exclusive ownership of all advertising space for every art exhibition event held by CIGE in greater China (including Hong Kong and Macao, and Taiwan) for the next 30 years, and 3) exclusive ownership of the "Gallery Guide" brand name and all gross revenues generated by the magazine publication for the next 30 years, including but not limited to advertising revenue and sponsorship revenue. The agreement further provides that if for any reason or under any circumstance during the next 30 years CIGE ceases holding any of its exhibitions or ceases publishing the Gallery Guide, NXMR shall have the right to buy those exhibitions and “Gallery Guide” brand name for the price of $1 each from CIGE.
 
As a result, NextMart’s planned business operations for 2011 consisted of 1) art event and art media direct marketing, and 2) the design and marketing of art-themed products lines for existing luxury and high-end goods and services, and art themed real estate developments.
 
On June 22, 2010, NextMart also entered into a strategic cooperative agreement (“Strategic Agreement”) with its shareholder Sun Media Investment Holdings Ltd. (“SMIH”) and with Redrock Land Investment Ltd. (“Redrock Land”), an affiliate of the Company’s major shareholder Redrock Capital Venture Ltd. (“Redrock”). Under the Redrock Land Strategic Agreement, Redrock Land will provide NextMart a $1,000,000 interest free, unsecured loan in 12 months. The loan is due on demand any time after the first anniversary of this agreement. As of September 30, 2010, the loan has not been provided to the Company. Redrock Land also has agreed that within the next 24 months, it will partner with NextMart on three of its real estate development projects that will be art related. For each such project, NextMart will act as the project’s concept, marketing, and sales consultant. Redrock Land is a BVI registered company engaged in land investment and development in China and it typically co-invests with real estate developers to acquire land and launch development projects. As part of its cooperation with NextMart, Redrock Land will secure land and developing partners for three art related developments for which NextMart will provide consulting service to the developers. Under the Strategic Agreements, SMIH has agreed to provide NextMart with approximately $6,000,000 worth of advertising space over the next five years in various media outlets owned by it or its affiliates. The $6,000,000 worth of advertising space will be allocated to NextMart such that every year for 5 succeeding years. NextMart will have access to $1,200,000 in advertising space in various print magazines and online websites and e-magazines owned by SMIH or its affiliates each year. Such advertising space will be subject to availability and market prices, and the Company intends to limit the use of the advertising space to market its Artslux products.

Going forward, our business operations will include: 1) art event and art media direct marketing; and 2) design and marketing of art-themed products lines created for existing luxury and high-end goods and brands and art themed real estate developments.

Competition and Market Data
 
In our proposed art business strategy, we will face competition from other companies located in China that are more established with more financial resources. However, we believe that we can compete in the market due to the uniqueness of our product marketing method and activities. Although many of the products are offered elsewhere by individual providers, there is no centralized channel to offer all of the products proposed by our company.
Proprietary Rights
 
As of the date of this Report, we do not have our own intellectual property rights.
 
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2018, the Company has no employees.
