Item 1. Business 

Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K Lone Star Gold, Inc. is referred to as we, our, us, the Company, or Lone Star.

The Company was formed as a Nevada corporation on November 26, 2007 as Keyser Resources, Inc.  On June 14, 2011, the Company changed its name to Lone Star Gold, Inc. The Company has been inactive since September 30, 2013. As of December 31, 2013 all of the Companys projects regarding La Candelaria and Chihuahua, Mexico (the Tailings Project) were abandoned and all contracts incident to those projects expired and or were terminated.

The Company was involved in exploration and development of mining properties until September 30, 2013 when it discontinued operations. In June of 2017 the Companys creditors filed a petition in the District Court of Harris County, Texas for the appointment of a receiver. In August of 2017, Angela Collette was appointed receiver pursuant to the petition. In connection with the receivership, Ms. Collette was appointed President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director of the Company. In February 2018 Ms. Collette appointed William Alessi as a director of the Company and then resigned as a director and officer of the Company.

Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, commonly referred to as the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
 
As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to:
 
·
 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (we also will not be subject to the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) as long as we are a smaller reporting company, which includes issuers that had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of their most recently completed second fiscal quarter);
 
·
 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and
 
·
 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under this provision, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise 
 
apply to private companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of such accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies until the first to occur of the date the subject company (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B). The Company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period and, as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. Accordingly, until the date that we are no longer an emerging growth company or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B), upon the issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to your financial statements and has a different effective date for public and private companies, clarify that we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for non-emerging growth companies and the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard.
