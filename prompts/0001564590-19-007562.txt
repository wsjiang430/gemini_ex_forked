Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are a pioneering clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on harnessing the power of the innate immune system by using the natural killer cell to treat cancer and viral infectious diseases. A critical aspect of our strategy is to invest significantly in innovating new therapeutic candidates, based upon our activated natural killer, or aNK, cell platform, as well as clinical testing and scale manufacturing of our leading product candidates. Natural killer, or NK, cells are the body’s first line of defense due to their innate ability to rapidly seek and destroy abnormal cells, such as cancer or virally infected cells, without prior exposure or activation by other support molecules, typically required to activate adaptive immune cells such as T‑cells.
 We hold the exclusive right to commercialize aNK cells, a commercially viable natural killer cell line, and a variety of genetically modified derivatives capable of killing cancer and virally infected cells. We own corresponding United States (U.S.) and foreign composition and methods-of-use patents and applications covering the cells, improvements, methods of expansion and manufacture and use of aNK cells as a therapeutic to treat a spectrum of clinical conditions.
 We also license exclusive commercial rights to a CD16 receptor expressing improvement of our aNK cell line, covered in a portfolio of U.S. and foreign composition and methods-of-use patents and applications covering both the non-clinical use in laboratory testing of monoclonal antibodies, as well as clinical use as a therapeutic to treat cancers in combination with antibody products.

We believe that our proprietary NK cell line, coupled with our integrated discovery ecosystem, positions us to implement precision cancer medicine by leveraging the advances that have evolved during the past decade and addressing newly discovered challenges of cancer. Cancer is only recently understood to be a complex of rare diseases, with hundreds of cancer specific proteins. We believe proteins, selectively expressed on the cancer cells and not on the essential normal tissue, represent large untapped targeting opportunities for immune effector cells such as our activated NK cells.
 Our Approach
 Multiple Modes of Tumor Cell Killing.  Our NK platform has demonstrated the ability to induce cell death in cancers and virally infected cells through a variety of concurrent mechanisms including (1) Innate Killing, whereby all of our NK platforms recognize the abnormal proteins typically found on stressed cells, which upon binding, release toxic granules to immediately kill their targets; (2) Antibody Mediated Killing with our haNK and t-haNK platforms, which are NK cells engineered to express antibody receptors that can bind to therapeutically administered antibody products or to antibodies naturally produced in the body, thereby enhancing the cancer cell killing effects of those antibodies through Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity, or ADCC; and (3) Chimeric Antigen Receptor, or CAR, Directed Killing with our taNK and t-haNK platforms, which are NK cells engineered to express CARs that target tumor-specific proteins commonly found on the surface of cancer cells and, upon binding, induce cell death through the release of toxic granules directly into its targets and by the release of cytokines and chemokines, which recruit additional innate and adaptive immune responses, including the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells.
 All three modes of killing; Innate Killing, Antibody Mediated Killing, and CAR Directed Killing, are employed by our t‑haNK platform, which combines all the enhanced NK killing functions of aNK, haNK and taNK into a single product platform.
 Our primary target therapeutic area is cancer, focusing on solid tumors and hematological malignancies. We eventually plan to advance therapies for virally induced infectious diseases.
 Innate Killing - the aNK Platform.  We have developed a unique NK cell platform, which we believe is capable of being manufactured as a cell-based “off-the-shelf” therapy that can be molecularly engineered in a variety of ways to boost its killing capabilities against cancers and virally infected cells. Unlike normal NK cells, our NK cells do not express the key inhibitory receptors that diseased cells often exploit to turn off the killing function of NK cells and escape elimination. We have developed a unique aNK cell, which omits many inhibitory receptors, while preserving critical activation receptors that enable selective innate targeting and killing of distressed and diseased cells. They do so through the recognition and binding of ‘stress-proteins’ that are overexpressed on the surfaces of (a) rapidly growing cancer cells due to oxidative and metabolic stress, nutrient deprivation and waste accumulation typical when cell growth outpaces the capacity of local circulation, and (b) virally infected cells where the cellular machinery is hijacked to produce an abundance of viral proteins and virons. Our aNK cells can also deliver a more lethal blow to its target by delivering a larger payload of lytic enzymes and cytokines responsible for both direct and indirect killing when compared to other NK cells isolated from healthy donors. We believe our aNK cells can be produced at commercial scale as a ‘living drug’ using our proprietary manufacturing and distribution processes to adequately address select global cancer markets.
 Several phase I safety studies with aNK cells have been conducted in a variety of bulky hematological cancers and solid tumors, enrolling 46 patients in a range of dose levels and schedules with encouraging evidence of single-agent activity and a durable remission, including complete responses in liquid tumors. Based on these clinical trials, we have further modified this aNK platform through virus-free molecular engineering designed to leverage additional modes of killing available to aNKs, including antibody mediated killing, the haNK platform, and both antibody mediated and CAR mediated antigen targeted killing, the t-haNK platform.
 Antibody Mediated Killing - the haNK Platform.  We have genetically engineered our aNK cells to overexpress high-affinity CD16 receptors, which bind to antibodies. These antibody targeted haNK cells are designed to directly bind to IgG1-type antibodies, such as avelumab, trastuzumab, cetuximab and rituximab with the intention of enhancing the cancer killing efficacy of these antibodies by boosting the population of competent NK cells that can kill cancer cells through ADCC. Antibody products are abundantly utilized to treat cancer and it is estimated that they generate over $100 billion in reported annual sales. A growing number of studies suggest that clinically meaningful responses to these antibody therapies correlate directly with the overall health of a patient’s NK cell population and whether they express the high-affinity variant of the CD16 receptor. Currently available literature estimates that only approximately 10% to 15% of the addressable patient population eligible for antibody therapies carry high-affinity CD16 receptors. This implies that our haNK product candidate may have significant market potential as a combination therapy to potentially address a large number of patients who do not carry high-affinity CD16 receptors and, as a result, exhibit a poorer response to antibody therapies. We therefore intend to develop our haNK product candidate as a combination therapy with widely-used U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved antibody products such as avelumab, trastuzumab, cetuximab and rituximab. Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, master and working cell banks of our haNK product candidate have been successfully established and will serve as our source for product for our clinical trials and commercialization going forward.

We have optimized our haNK product manufacturing process partly through the successful development of a product that does not require IL-2 cytokine supplementation to the growth media every few days, thereby enabling us to overcome a technically challenging and costly limitation that many other NK cell-based therapies face. We have also successfully established processes for large-scale production, cryopreservation and long-term storage of final dose forms, thereby optimizing production efficiencies and allowing for on-demand availability with minimal handling at the infusion sites. Our cryopreserved haNK product has been approved for use in several phase Ib/II clinical trials.
 CAR Mediated Killing - the taNK Platform.  We have genetically engineered our aNK platform to express CARs that target tumor-specific antigens found on the surfaces of cancers and virally infected cells. Our taNK cells are designed to bind directly to these surface antigens and induce cell death through the release of toxic granules directly into the tumor cells and release cytokines and chemokines to recruit additional innate and adaptive immune responses, including the recruitment of cytotoxic T‑cells. These tumor antigens encompass four categories of proteins, all of which can be targeted individually by our engineered taNK products: (1) checkpoint ligands, such as PD-L1 and B7‑H4; (2) widely-established tumor proteins such as HER2 and CD19; (3) novel surface antigens associated with cancer stem cells such as CD123 and IGF‑R1; and (4) newly discovered proteins from individual patient tumor samples, known as neoepitopes. Preclinical evidence has been mounting which demonstrates that taNK cell activation through the binding of its CAR receptors to these cancer specific proteins is potent enough to override many of the pre-existing inhibitory signals and immunosuppressive factors present in the tumor microenvironment that may be responsible for tumor resistance.
 CAR Mediated and Antibody Mediated Killing - the t‑haNK Platform.  Our newest platform for the development of therapeutic product candidates is an innovative, bioengineered combination of our haNK and taNK platforms that incorporates all the features of our haNK platform together with a CAR. The resulting line of products under this platform avails itself to all three modes of killing: innate, antibody mediated and CAR mediated killing. These products also include one or more additional expression elements such as functional cytokines, chemokines and trafficking factors, making them amongst the most versatile in our portfolio. These products are intended to be combined with commercially available therapeutic antibodies to effectively target either two different epitopes of the same cancer specific protein or two entirely different cancer specific proteins. In addition to our two lead t‑haNK product candidates, PD‑L1.t‑haNK and CD19.t‑haNK, both currently at the IND filing stage, a pipeline of prominent CARs for t‑haNK are advancing through human enabling studies, including BCMA, HER2 and EGFR, to address an even broader range of cancers as part of a chemotherapy-free combination regimen.
 The Nant Cancer Vaccine.  The Nant Cancer Vaccine, or NCV, program is a personalized therapy regimen, which utilizes our “off-the-shelf” NK cells as the backbone of the therapy. NCV consists of an initial tumor-conditioning regimen followed by a molecularly-informed immunologic conditioning therapy. More specifically, NCV combines tumor and peripheral blood genomic and transcriptomic data derived from our affiliates NantOmics’ and NantHealth Labs’ sequencing and analytical services with the novel delivery of metronomic, albumin-bound low-dose chemotherapy in conjunction with certain other agents, followed by a sequenced administration of tumor-associated antigen vaccines and IL‑15, all of which potentiate our NK cell therapy to potentially drive immunogenic cell death while avoiding the ravages of toxic high-dose chemotherapy. By inducing immunogenic cell death and enhancing a patient’s innate and adaptive immune system, NCV is designed to attain a long-term, durable response in multiple cancer types with a potential for lower toxicity and improved efficacy in comparison with current standards of care. We believe ultimately that employing our NK cell therapy in the context of NCV would be a highly effective combination for long term clinical success over available standards of care that employ maximum tolerated dose, tolerogenic cell death and immune system compromise.
 Our Integrated Discovery Ecosystem for Precision Medicine.  In order to effectively target newly discovered neoepitopes, we plan to eventually integrate the following ecosystem to help drive the utility of our NK cell therapies against these unique cancer markers, including the use of our haNK platform in conjunction with cancer vaccines that induce in vivo antibody formation directed against these mutated proteins as well as the development of t‑haNK cells that directly target these mutated proteins: (1) a high-speed supercomputing infrastructure to help identify both known antigens on the surface of tumor cells and neoepitopes in clinical patients suffering from cancer, in a timely manner and at large scale; (2) a next-generation genomic and transcriptomic sequencing infrastructure to verify the expression of the neoepitopes in the tumor cell, developed by our affiliate entity NantOmics; (3) delivering the neoepitope via an adenoviral or yeast platform developed by an affiliate entity to induce production of IgG1-type antibodies in the body, which would in turn combine with our haNK cells to accelerate ADCC tumor killing; (4) a diverse library of human antibodies from which to interrogate and extract an antibody to construct a CAR for genetic incorporation into our t‑haNK platform; and (5) CAR‑targeted t‑haNK cells potentially capable of being produced as a scalable cell-based “off-the-shelf” therapy, without the need for patient compatibility matching. We expect to regularly add newly discovered neoepitopes and novel antibody/CAR targets from our discovery engine, and we believe the thousands of newly discovered antigens selectively expressed on the cancer cells and not on the essential normal tissue will provide us with the ability to create new libraries of cancer-specific antibodies and their corresponding CARs to be potentially delivered as living drugs for selective targeting of metastatic cancer cells and cancer stem cells.

Potential Advantages of our aNK Platform over T‑Cell and Other Current Immunotherapies
 The immune system has two components: innate immune cells, such as NK cells, which are always primed and ready to attack diseased cells, and adaptive immune cells, such as T‑cells, which are recruited and educated through a series of antigen presentation and clonal expansion, eventually mounting a delayed response. Our proprietary aNK platform is specifically designed to potentially address many of the limitations associated with current adaptive autologous cellular immunotherapies. We believe key limitations of adaptive autologous immunotherapy are the need to isolate adequate amounts of native T‑cells from a cancer patient in a lengthy procedure called leukapheresis and the requirement for a complex individualized genetic transfection and expansion campaign to manufacture each patient’s therapy. As a consequence, current autologous CAR‑T cell therapies, in large part, are limited to patients from highly selected hematological cancers and leave many patients ineligible for treatment. Additionally, patients must undergo lympho-depleting chemotherapy prior to receiving CAR‑T therapy and rely on engraftment, thereby exposing themselves to life-threatening serious adverse events for extended periods. For instance, recipients of CD19 CAR‑T therapy develop life-long B‑cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia, requiring immunoglobulin infusion therapy. Acutely, patients may develop cytokine release syndrome or acute or chronic neurotoxicities. Due to these and other events, treatment with CAR‑T requires intensive inpatient and long term monitoring. In contrast, our allogeneic, “off-the-shelf” NK cells can be infused in the outpatient setting and do not rely on the patient as the source of suitable immune cells for processing, thereby availing every cancer patient as a potential candidate for on-demand treatment. In addition, our NK cell therapy is intended to be combined with immune potentiating agents, rather than immuno-depleting agents with the interest of driving a more natural and long-lasting adaptive immune response.
 For these reasons, we believe that our approach includes the following advantages:
  
• | Innate immune response. aNK platform products are always activated and can naturally detect and rapidly destroy a wide variety of diseased cells without prior exposure to antigens or activation by stimulatory molecules. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Promotion of adaptive immune response. aNK platform products stimulate the adaptive component of the immune system by producing chemokines and other molecules that recruit and activate T‑cells directly and through dendritic cells to attack cancers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhancement of ADCC effect with CD16 expressing haNK cells. Our haNK product candidates may have significant market potential as a combination therapy with approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting tumor associated antigens as well as neoepitope induced antibodies, potentially addressing a large number of patients who have poor responses to antibody products. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wide therapeutic potential across multiple tumor types and even late-stage disease. In preclinical studies and phase I safety clinical trials to date, aNK cells have demonstrated activity in a spectrum of cancers, including bulky hematological cancers and solid tumors, as well as late-stage cancer patients who have failed multiple rounds of chemotherapy, radiation and stem cell transplantation. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to attack cancer stem cells. aNK cells have been shown in preclinical studies to preferentially attack cancer stem cells, which have demonstrated resistance to conventional chemotherapy. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Applications in diseases beyond cancer. We believe aNK platform products have the potential to treat diseases beyond cancer, such as viral infectious diseases because of the inherent ability of NK cells to kill virally infected cells. Preclinical studies in HIV, HCV, EBV and Ebola viruses demonstrate this capability. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well tolerated. aNK cells are hypo-immunogenic and have shown no dose limiting toxicities in over 46 patients who have received therapy to date, even when some patients received as many as 18 infusions of aNK cells over a six month period. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of administration. aNK platform products may be administrable in outpatient facilities, offering physicians the flexibility to re-dose therapy in the ambulatory setting for extended periods and in large practices. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Virtually universal patient compatibility. aNK platform products do not require patient-donor matching or a minimum level of patient immuno-competence. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low-cost, efficient and scalable manufacturing. aNK, haNK, taNK and t‑haNK cells have the potential to be expanded on a large scale and readily supplied on demand from what we believe is the world’s only GMP compliant aNK cell bank, a proprietary asset of our Company.

Experienced Management Team
 Since the founding of our company in 2002, we have assembled a team of proven, experienced and visionary leaders in biotechnology. Our team is led by Patrick Soon-Shiong, M.D., FRCS (C), FACS, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, or CEO. Dr. Soon-Shiong was first introduced to us in 2007 when our technology was at a very early stage of development and he provided us with advice and scientific development strategies, including demonstration of activity in the clinical setting following irradiation of the cells and demonstration of safety and activity following multiple infusions in patients with both end-stage solid and liquid tumors. Dr. Soon-Shiong made an equity investment in our company in December 2014, joined as our Chief Medical Officer in January 2015, and became our Chairman and CEO in March 2015. Dr. Soon-Shiong, a renowned surgeon and scientist, has pioneered novel therapies for both diabetes and cancer, published over 100 scientific papers in the U.S., and has been issued over 230 worldwide patents on groundbreaking advancements spanning a myriad of fields. He performed the first encapsulated islet stem cell transplant in a diabetic patient in the U.S. He invented, developed and launched the first nanoparticle delivery system of human albumin, Abraxane. Dr. Soon-Shiong was founder, Chairman and CEO of American Pharmaceutical Partners (sold to Fresenius SE for approximately $4.6 billion in 2008), Abraxis BioScience (sold to Celgene Corporation for approximately $3.8 billion in 2010), and NantWorks, an ecosystem of companies to create a transformative global health information and next generation pharmaceutical development network.
 Barry Simon, M.D., our President and Chief Administrative Officer, who was our CEO from May 2007 until March 2015 and our President and Chief Operating Officer from March 2015 to December 2016, brings decades of drug development and executive leadership experience from Roche Labs, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Connetics Corp. and Immunomedics, having successfully contributed to Biologics License Applications, or BLAs, and drug launches for Xeloda, Pegasys, Kytril, Fortovase, Valcyte, Fuzeon and Tamiflu.
 Since 2015, the company recruited seasoned executives to lead manufacturing, clinical development, regulatory affairs, medical affairs, quality and other critical staff and continues to build the management and manufacturing infrastructure.
 Company Vision
 Our vision is to be the premier immunotherapy company, harnessing the power of the innate immune system with the NK cell at the core, to pioneer precision medicine in the treatment of cancers and viral infectious diseases.
Our Core Strategies
 Our goal of becoming the world leader in immunotherapy for cancers and other diseases can be realized through a major reframing of how we apply the collective knowledge amassed in this field to date. This starts with precisely determining the ‘molecular address’ of the target disease and leveraging this knowledge in the selection and staging of both tumor and immune conditioning agents in accordance with our understanding of biological mechanisms of action and the natural order of immune biology. Metronomic, low-doses of certain agents would be utilized to potentiate cellular stress and boost tumor immunogenicity, while an array of other agents would be applied selectively and sequentially to propagate a meaningful and lasting adaptive immune response. We believe that by utilizing the NK cell as the backbone and central coordinator as we engage and sequentially orchestrate the entire ecosystem of immune cells, we can effectively empower the patient’s own immune system to regain control by becoming its own ‘drug factory’ that can establish and once again maintain a cancer-free environment in the body. The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Pursuit of both accelerated regulatory pathways and large market opportunities. We are pursuing a comprehensive clinical development plan designed to maximize the commercial potential of our haNK and t‑haNK platforms as the backbone in the treatment of cancers in a simple combination with a PD‑L1 checkpoint inhibitor and IL‑15 cytokine immunotherapy. We intend to pursue accelerated regulatory approval pathways and seek indications that can lead to orphan drug status and breakthrough therapy designation, as well as pursue large market opportunities in select solid tumors in the shortest feasible timeframe. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Progress our lead haNK product through phase II and registration trials. We are leveraging the combined human safety and activity data accumulated to date on haNK therapy to conduct our multi-center phase II trial in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma who have relapsed on checkpoint therapy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Advance our next-generation t‑haNK products into first-in-human clinical trials. We are making preparations to initiate phase I safety studies for the first two t‑haNK products to ever reach clinical testing. A CD19.t‑haNK IND has been submitted to the FDA and PD‑L1.t‑haNK is IND ready with a planned submission during the second quarter of 2019. We anticipate dosing patients in the second half of 2019. We intend to progress these programs to phase Ib/II trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, and in PD‑L1‑high non-small cell lung cancers, respectively. We believe a pipeline of IND-ready t‑haNK product candidates will emerge in the second half of 2019 and may include HER2, EGFR and BCMA.t‑haNK products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue partnering opportunities with pharmaceutical companies for commercially approved antibodies and select late-stage antibodies in development. Numerous biopharmaceutical companies have previously licensed our research-grade haNK cells through an affiliated entity for non-therapeutic applications that facilitate the discovery, selection and validation of their antibody candidates for development. A growing number of these biopharmaceutical companies have also licensed our cells for use in their antibody manufacturing and testing procedures in order to satisfy requirements by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies. There may be multiple opportunities to leverage these biopharmaceutical business relationships to forge therapeutic collaborations to conduct clinical studies with our haNK and t‑haNK product candidates in combination with their late-stage and commercial antibody products to demonstrate enhanced activity when used in combination. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accelerate clinical development of our t-haNK products by implementing phase Ib/II basket trials. A growing number of antibody and other anti-cancer products are being marketed for multiple cancer types that share the same molecular abnormality. We plan to accelerate clinical development of our CD19.t‑haNK and PD‑L1.t‑haNK product candidates by designing trials that permit the enrollment of patients whose cancers demonstrate high levels of CD19 and PD‑L1, respectively, from a number of select cancer types. We believe this approach will enhance the development potential of our t‑haNK product pipeline. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish low-cost, scalable manufacturing capabilities to support late-stage clinical trials and global commercialization. We believe our aNK platform products offer unique advantages of a simplified, on-demand manufacturing process that is relatively easy to scale and requires minimal handling at the site of infusion. We opened our state-of-the-art commercial production facility in El Segundo, California, at the beginning of 2019 and transferred all of our manufacturing operations from our pilot facility in Culver City, California. We believe this new facility is capable of producing clinical product for all our clinical trials for multiple product lines and well into commercialization. We have developed novel manufacturing methods, including the use of proprietary equipment that employs state-of-the-art optics as well as proprietary media, designed to maximize the attributes of our NK product lines. We have eliminated the need for IL‑2 media supplementation in all of our bioreactors and product lines, thereby simplifying the expansion process and shortening the culturing times while significantly reducing production costs. We also implemented proprietary cryopreservation methods that enable large-scale production yields that can be easily processed into final frozen dose forms for long-term storage and simple, on-demand shipping. Cryopreservation allows for significant cost efficiencies and the establishment of a substantial commercial pipeline supply, much like shelf-stable pharmaceutical drugs. We have effectively eliminated reliance on third party contract manufacturers, with the associated risks to cost, time and reliability. We plan to continue to improve our costs as we scale up production and establish efficiencies across our pipeline products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue opportunities with vaccine and cytokine combination partnerships that drive in vivo production of anti-cancer antibodies for ADCC killing with haNK and t‑haNK cells. We ultimately plan to enroll patients into a wide range of combination therapy studies that employ adenoviral and yeast vaccine platforms together with a novel IL‑15 cytokine agonist to deliver tumor associated antigens that induce the natural production of IgG1-type antibodies in patients, and when combined with our haNK and t‑haNK cells, maximize both ADCC killing and adaptive immune responses. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extend our NK platform to address diseases beyond cancer. We believe our aNK platform has the potential to address diseases beyond cancer such as viral infectious diseases because of the inherent ability of NK cells to kill virally infected cells. Preclinical studies in HIV, HCV, EBV and Ebola viruses demonstrate this capability. Preliminary efforts are underway to evaluate the role of a unique CAR taNK product in clearing HIV reservoirs as part of a novel immunotherapy combination regimen.

Our Therapeutic Platforms
 Leveraging Our Assets
 In 2018, we developed a pre-clinical portfolio of t‑haNK products based on the combined attributes of our existing haNK and taNK platforms. We also advanced our haNK product into several clinical trials, which incorporated a comprehensively orchestrated tumor and immune-conditioning regimen known as the NCV, and generated compelling safety and activity data. We now plan to advance our lead clinical candidates from the haNK and t‑haNK platforms into checkpoint inhibitor and IL‑15 combination trials in select cancer indications.
 Our aNK Platform is the Foundation for our haNK, taNK and t‑haNK Product Candidates.  Based on the unique characteristics of our aNK cells, we continue to expand the potential therapeutic applications of this platform through molecular engineering designed to leverage the multiple modes of killing available to aNK cells, including (1) innate plus antibody mediated killing, the haNK platform; (2) innate plus antigen targeted killing, the taNK platform; and (3) a combination of all three, the t‑haNK platform, as illustrated below.
 

8

Antibody Mediated Killing - the haNK Platform.  We have genetically engineered our aNK cells to both overexpress high-affinity CD16 receptors and the IL‑2 cytokine. These haNK cells are well suited to directly bind to concurrently administered therapeutic antibodies such as avelumab, trastuzumab, cetuximab and rituximab to potentially enhance their targeted cancer killing effects through ADCC, as illustrated below.
 

9

CAR Mediated Killing - the taNK Platform.  We have genetically modified our aNK cells to incorporate CARs that target cancer specific proteins typically found on the surface of cancer cells. These taNK cells are designed to directly bind to these surface proteins in a variety of solid and hematological cancers and induce cell death through the release of toxic granules directly into the tumor cell and the release of cytokines and chemokines, which recruit additional innate and adaptive immune responses, including the recruitment of cytotoxic T‑cells. CARs are complex molecules that are designed to traverse the cell membrane and are comprised of four elements: (1) the antibody-derived Fv fragment, or scFv, which appears on the external membrane surface of the taNK cell, where it is exposed and available to bind to cancer specific antigens; (2) a transmembrane hinge region; (3) an optional CD28 co-stimulatory domain; and (4) one of several signaling domain segments which resides on the internal surface of the membrane where, upon external Fv binding, it is available to signal the activation cascade to release cytotoxic compounds to destroy the targeted cancer cell. Unlike CAR‑T and T‑cell receptor therapies, taNK killing is human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, independent for “off-the-shelf” applications and does not depend on additional (second generation) co-stimulatory domains, such as 4‑1BB or OX40, which are often necessary in CAR‑T cells for immune cell activation and survival.
 

10

CAR Mediated and Antibody Mediated Killing - the t‑haNK Platform.  We have genetically engineered our aNK cells to exhibit all three mechanisms of killing, thereby imparting CAR targeted killing via cancer specific antigens, ADCC based killing as mediated by antibody products, innate killing inherent to NK cells, as well as independence from IL‑2 supplementation for expansion and viability and a functional enhancer such as an activating cytokine or intensified trafficking ability. Based on this unique arrangement, t‑haNK cells can target two distinct cancer antigens at once: one via its CD16 receptor and an antibody such as rituximab (CD20), and the other through its CAR receptor (i.e. CD19), as illustrated below.
 

In the taNK and t‑haNK cell lines, the activation signaling that results from the binding of the CARs to the tumor-specific antigens can be strong enough to overcome both cancer escape mechanisms and suppressive factors present in the tumor microenvironment. These tumor antigens encompass four categories of proteins, all of which can be targeted individually by our engineered taNK products: (1) checkpoint ligands, such as PD‑L1 and B7‑H4; (2) widely-established tumor proteins such as HER2 and CD19; (3) novel surface antigens associated with cancer stem cells such as CD123 and IGF‑R1; and (4) newly discovered proteins from individual patient tumor samples, known as neoepitopes.
 11

The table below highlights some of our CAR taNK products and their intended targets using our aNK platform, as reported in the scientific and medical journals listed below.
 

Non-Clinical Validation of HER2.taNK, a Compelling Case for t‑haNK-based Therapies.  We are preparing a novel lineup of virus-free t‑haNK product candidates that are IL‑2 growth independent, cryopreserved, CAR expressing cell lines based on our haNK cell therapeutic, several of which are progressing towards phase I clinical trials. We previously licensed from Chemotherapeutisches Forschungsinstitut Georg-Speyer-Haus and DRK-Blutspendedienst Baden-Wurttenberg-Hessen GmbH a lentiviral based HER2 CAR expressing cell line that is based on our original aNK cell product, which lacks CD16 receptors for antibody mediated killing and is IL‑2 growth dependent. Due to the rapid advancement and clinical readiness of our virus-free tri- and quad-cistronic t‑haNK platforms, we have decided to discontinue development of this licensed lentiviral-based product in favor of advancing an internally developed HER2 CAR expressing t‑haNK product. Such next-generation products avoid the safety concerns associated with the use of retro and lentiviral sequences, incorporate the high-affinity CD16 receptor for enhanced antibody mediated killing, as well as IL‑2 and other functional components, which can potentially enhance clinical efficacy and reduce production costs. Additionally, data generated from the previously licensed HER2 CAR expressing cell line has provided significant non-clinical validation to continue to pursue our internally developed therapeutic targeting HER2.
 Clinical Experience with our aNK Cell Therapy Candidate
 Our clinical experience with single and multiple intravenous infusions of aNK monotherapy across a range of relapsed and refractory solid and hematological malignancies has been consistently encouraging from both an activity and safety standpoint. We have demonstrated single-agent safety with dose escalations in both single and repeat dosing schedules to doses as high as 1 x 1010 cells/m2 and as many as 18 infusions over a six-month period, corresponding to a cumulative dose of as much as 15 x 1010 cells. Infusion-related toxicities remained generally mild across all studies, with the exception of one grade 3 fever and one grade 4 hypoglycemic episode, neither of which resulted in dose reduction or study discontinuation. Some subjects that proceeded with additional testing were found to have developed anti-HLA antibodies, but none were required to withdraw from study and some continued to receive additional infusions uneventfully.
 While many cell-based adaptive immunotherapy trials impose heavy pre-screening protocols, our subjects were not pre-selected based on the likelihood of response, but rather accepted all-comers including patients who had very advanced disease, having failed multiple rounds of standard chemotherapy, radiation, surgery and even stem cell transplantation. Additionally, none of these patients received lympho-depleting or pre-conditioning agents in order to enhance therapeutic effects.

Although aNK is not intended as a monotherapy, clinical activity was recorded in all studies conducted to date. Among the three Merkel cell cancer patients receiving aNK cells, one subject achieved a long-lasting partial response followed by a radiologic complete response at the time of occurrence of a new lesion, and one subject achieved a mixed response. Among the four lung cancer patients treated, three subjects had clinically significant responses including lymph node and mediastinal mass resolution and disease stabilization, respectively. Among 12 patients with advanced melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, one patient went on to have a mixed response, with some lesions resolving, while five other patients achieved disease stabilization after having breakthrough progression on their prior therapies. Among 12 subjects with advanced hematological malignancies, two subjects with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple myeloma, achieved a complete response, one subject achieved a partial response, another with a clinical-transient response, and one subject achieved a mixed-transient response. And lastly, among six patients with acute myeloid leukemia, one subject achieved a significant reduction in percentage of blasts and two subjects achieved a stable percentage of blasts present in their peripheral blood. Additional detail on each of these studies follows:
 Merkel Cell Carcinoma: QUILT 3.009 (NantKwest Sponsored)
 This completed multi-center, nonrandomized, open-label phase II study was in patients 18 years and older with histologically confirmed stage IIIB or stage IV inoperable Merkel cell carcinoma. The primary endpoint was a four‑month progression-free survival rate, and the secondary endpoints were overall response rate, time to disease progression, median overall survival, safety, and quality-of-life assessment. The study used a Simon’s two-stage optimal design where up to 12 patients would be enrolled in the first stage for treatment with aNK monotherapy, and if one or more patients from the initial group experienced progression-free survival for 16 weeks or more, then the second stage would initiate where the balance of the study could proceed to full enrollment. Shortly after achieving this progression-free survival rate metric, the protocol was amended so that patients enrolled in the second stage would receive aNK in combination with N‑803, an IL‑15 superagonist, developed by NantCell, Inc., an affiliated entity. Patients who were already receiving aNK as monotherapy received aNK in combination with N‑803 in subsequent cycles. The aNK dose of 2 × 109 cells/m2 was administered intravenously on two consecutive days every two weeks (one cycle). N‑803 was administered subcutaneous at 10 µg/kg on the first day of every aNK infusion (prior to aNK infusion) every two weeks. Patients were withdrawn from the trial if there was evidence of disease progression at any time point after the fourth cycle.
 A total of three subjects received treatment with aNK monotherapy and a total of four subjects were treated with aNK plus N‑803, all having previously received and failed treatment with multiple lines of therapy that included checkpoint inhibitors. There were no serious adverse events of grade 3 or higher that were considered to be related to treatment with the study drugs. All adverse events that may have been related to study drug administration were grade 2 or milder and included chest tightness, chills, fatigue, upper respiratory infection, strep throat, redness at the injection site, hypokalemia, hypotension, anorexia, mucosal infection, and hyponatremia.
 The overall response rate in this initial group of patients was 29%, with two of seven patients experiencing a partial response or complete response. One patient receiving aNK monotherapy experienced an initial partial response for 62 days, followed by a complete response for 52 days, after which progressive disease was confirmed by biopsy. A second patient receiving aNK in combination with N‑803 experienced a partial response for 58 days, followed by progressive disease. A third patient receiving aNK in combination with N‑803 experienced stable disease for 184 days followed by progressive disease. Three of the remaining four patients showed progressive disease at the first imaging assessment. The final patient was discontinued from treatment due to clinical disease progression prior to the first imaging assessment.
 Results from this study show that treatment with aNK and N‑803 is well-tolerated, as no treatment-related serious adverse events were associated with aNK monotherapy or with aNK plus N‑803 combination therapy. Moreover, treatment with both aNK monotherapy and aNK plus N‑803 combination therapy were associated with anticancer activity. These results suggest treatment with aNK and N‑803 at doses sufficient to elicit tumor regression is associated with manageable and relatively modest adverse events and provides a foundation upon which to investigate the use of our “off-the-shelf” haNK product in a chemotherapy-free combination.
 Advanced Solid Tumors (Investigator Sponsored)
 This phase I, single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation study conducted at the University Hospital in Frankfurt, evaluated the safety and efficacy of aNK cell therapy in 15 pediatric and adult patients with advanced cancer resistant to standard therapies. The objectives of the study were to evaluate safety and clinical outcomes. The three aNK dose levels were 1 × 109 cells/m2, 3 × 109 cells/m2, and 1 × 1010 cells/m2 (1 × 1010 cells/m2 was administered in adults only). Two infusions of aNK were administered intravenously on days one and three.
 13

All infusions were well tolerated by all patients, even at the highest dose level, with the exception of one patient whose second transfusion was discontinued after he reported lower back pain. No effect on bone marrow function was observed in any patient with stable blood cell counts over the first four weeks after aNK treatment. Likewise, no changes in renal and hepatic functions were noted. One of seven tested patients had an antibody response to HLA antigens expressed by aNK at the time of testing, one- and four-weeks after aNK infusions; this patient had received blood transfusions after aNK infusion with potential transmission of antibodies.
 Three patients with advanced lung cancer had clinically significant responses after two doses of aNK. One patient had a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer with a supraclavicular lymph node metastasis. After treatment with two infusions of 3 × 109 cells/m2, the patient’s lymph node metastasis could no longer be detected.
 A second patient had small cell lung cancer with multiple metastases in the liver and a single metastasis in the lung just behind the sternum. After two infusions of 3 × 109 cells/m2, there was significant regression in the lung metastasis. This was verified by x-ray analysis taken before and 14 days after aNK treatment. There was no remission of the liver metastasis.
 A third patient had a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer with multiple lung metastases resistant to conventional chemotherapy. After treatment with two infusions of 1 × 1010 cells/m2, the disease stabilized. Four months after receiving two initial infusions, the third patient received four additional infusions of aNK cells (5 × 109 to 1 × 1010 cells/m2) over a period of six months, with no adverse events from either the initial or subsequent treatments.
 Advanced Melanoma or Renal Cell Carcinoma (Investigator Sponsored)
 This phase I, open-label, single-arm, single-center, dose-escalation study, conducted at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, evaluated the feasibility and safety of multiple administrations of aNK in 12 patients 18 years and older with measureable refractory or relapsed advanced melanoma. The primary endpoints were the feasibility and safety of administration of multiple infusions of aNK. The four aNK dose levels were 1 × 108 cells/m2, 3 × 108 cells/m2, 1 × 109 cells/m2, and 3 × 109 cells/m2 administered intravenously on days one, three, and five.
 Three patients developed grade 1 fever and one patient developed grade 3 fever, all possibly related to aNK infusions. One patient developed grade 4 hypoglycemia, considered related to aNK. Four adverse events were considered not related to aNK and included three exacerbations of tumor pain (grade 2 neck pain, grade 2 chest pain, and grade 3 back pain) and one grade 2 rheumatoid arthritis pain. There were no serious infections reported for patients at the one-year follow-up. Six patients had elevations in lactate dehydrogenase enzymes, and four patients had elevated cytokines, potentially due to tumor lysis reaction.
 One patient had a mixed response, five patients had stable disease, and six patients had progressive disease. All responses were transient in this heavily pretreated population. A single patient with renal cell carcinoma had a mixed response (progression in the mediastinum and reduction in lung masses) at four weeks post infusion. One patient with melanoma had a response of stable disease but had a minor response in a target lesion in the upper neck that was documented at two weeks post infusion.
 Hematologic Malignancies (Investigator Sponsored)
 This phase I, open-label, single-arm, single-center, dose-escalation study conducted at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto, evaluated the safety of aNK in patients 18 years and older with histologically confirmed, refractory hematologic malignancies who relapsed after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. The primary endpoint was safety and the secondary endpoints were efficacy, immune responses to aNK, and kinetics of infused aNK. The three aNK dose levels were 1 × 109 cells/m2, 3 × 109 cells/m2, and 5 × 109 cells/m2 administered intravenously on days one, three, and five of each cycle of treatment. Patients could receive up to six cycles, administered monthly.
 A total of 12 patients were enrolled in the study. Some patients experienced grade 1 fever, chills, fatigue, blurry vision, and nausea. There was a single grade 2 adverse event of fever and chills that occurred during an aNK infusion. No grade 3 or 4 adverse events were observed. There were no clinically significant alterations in hemoglobin, platelets, white cell counts, creatinine, or liver function tests. Six patients developed anti-HLA antibodies, typically after the second cycle of aNK. Cytokine release was not observed in any of the patients, although there was a transient rise in IL‑10 and IL‑6 in two patients.
 14

Five of 12 patients had responses to aNK cell therapy: two complete responses, one partial response, one clinical-transient response, and one mixed-transient response. One complete response was observed in a patient with relapsed, refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and this patient remains in remission more than ten years after aNK cell therapy. The second complete response was observed in a patient with IgA kappa myeloma who received concomitant lenalidomide-dexamethasone therapy during and after aNK cell infusions, and this patient remains on maintenance therapy with an ongoing complete response two years after aNK cell therapy. An additional three patients experienced partial or transient responses. One patient diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma had a partial response after one cycle of aNK cell infusion. This patient elected to undergo allotransplantation and subsequently died of allotransplant-related complications. A patient diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia showed clinical improvement and subsequently progressed after completing six monthly cycles of aNK infusion. A patient with DLBCL also showed a transient clinical improvement that was followed by progressive disease.
 Acute Myeloid Leukemia: QUILT 3.018 (NantKwest Sponsored)
 This phase I, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation/de-escalation study evaluated the safety in patients 18 years and older with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. The primary endpoints were the maximum tolerated dose and safety of aNK and the secondary endpoints were therapeutic efficacy and aNK cell phenotype, cytotoxic activity, presence in bone marrow, and effects on patient immune systems. Two dose levels of aNK were used: 1 × 109 cells/m2 and 3 × 109 cells/m2. One course of aNK treatment comprised a total of two intravenous infusions of the same cell dose with each intravenous infusion administered 24 hours apart (i.e., days one and two). Patients underwent bone marrow biopsy 21 days after each course of therapy. Patients who had stable disease or reduction of leukemia blasts were eligible to receive additional aNK infusions.
 Seven patients were enrolled in the study and received treatment with aNK. None of the seven patients who received aNK cells experienced a dose-limiting toxicity during administration of the aNK cell infusions or during the 21-day observation period post infusion. There were no grade 3 or grade 4 toxicities related to aNK cell infusions. One patient developed grade 2 fever and chills following each aNK infusion that required hospitalization. These known aNK-related effects were reversible with supportive care. Hospitalizations that occurred during the observation period that were not related to aNK cell infusions were for line-related bacteremia, neutropenic fever, red blood cell and platelet transfusion, and pneumonia.
 Six patients were evaluable for response. None of the patients achieved complete remission or partial response. One patient had reduction of the percentage of blasts after a course of therapy, and two patients had stable percentage of blasts.
 Our Clinical Pipeline
 haNK Product Candidate
 Overview
 Our haNK cell therapeutic is our molecularly engineered aNK cell platform which incorporates both the expression of (1) a natural, high-affinity antibody engager, FcγRIIIa/CD16 receptor, that binds to therapeutically administered cancer-targeting antibodies, resulting in destruction of the cancer targets through a mechanism widely referred to as ADCC, and (2) the IL‑2 support cytokine, whose expression is retained within the cell where it can exert its maximum effects of supporting growth and killing function while sparing leakage into the extracellular surroundings, where it could result in cytokine-related symptoms. Our internal research efforts have demonstrated that our high affinity CD16 receptors are cleaved during ADCC-mediated killing of target cancer cells, thereby enabling our haNK cells to engage in serial killing of multiple cancer targets, rather than remaining bound to the first target cell it encounters, a key drawback of non-cleavable CD16 receptors. Additionally, CD16 receptor expression rebounds and recovers rapidly in haNK cells after attacking its target when compared to other types of NK cells. This unique feature distinguishes our haNK cell product as the true serial killer.
 Our haNK cells also retain their innate killing mechanisms such as NKG2D receptors, making it a highly versatile killer product suitable for clinical testing. In preclinical studies, the combination of haNK cells with a number of different therapeutic antibodies led to significantly enhanced tumor cell killing when compared to the use of the antibody as a single agent, thereby providing strong scientific support for this novel combination approach.
 15

haNK as the Current ‘Gold-Standard’ in Non-Clinical Characterization of Commercial Antibody Products.  Our haNK cells have been widely utilized by numerous biopharmaceutical companies, including many well-known large-pharma companies, under non-exclusive licenses for in vitro ADCC testing of their antibodies in development and in certain instances, to release-test their commercially available antibody products. For example, our haNK cells have been adapted for use in commercial assays such as BioTek’s automated Delfia ADCC assay system and Agilent’s xCELLigence system. In the Delfia ADCC assay system it was determined that the concentration of Herceptin that gives half-maximum response (EC50) is 48% higher in the absence of haNK cells, thereby demonstrating how haNK assists Herceptin in achieving its peak killing capacity.
 

16

Irradiated haNK Cells Have a Higher Innate Killing Frequency than Healthy Donor NK Cells.  The following graph compares innate killing of target breast cancer cells by healthy donor NK cells versus irradiated haNK cells. Irradiated haNK cells have a three-fold higher killing frequency (on a per cell basis) than the average killing frequency of healthy donor NK cells, thereby demonstrating substantially greater levels of lysis from irradiated haNK cells across a range of effector-to-target cell ratios (A). Quantitative analysis of the killing frequency demonstrated that, on average, it took three healthy donor NK cells to kill the same amount of tumor target as one irradiated haNK cell, thereby implying serial killing activity (B).
 

Irradiated haNK Cells are Efficient Killers of a Wide Range of Cancer Types Through their Innate Killing Mechanism without Reliance on their ADCC Killing Mechanisms.  In the graphs that follow, irradiated haNK cells exhibit an ability to efficiently kill 13 human tumor cell lines via innate mechanisms such as NKG2D‑NKG2DL receptors, without the addition of antibodies. This was demonstrated in innate killing assays against lung, colon, breast, cervical, ovarian, pancreatic and chordoma cancer lines. With the exception of ASPC‑1, target killing was consistently observed in an effector-to-target, or E:T, dependent manner.

Addition of Antibody Products to haNK Cells Adds an ADCC Mechanism for Killing Tumors that would Otherwise Be Resistant to Innate Killing, and Does so in a Dose-Dependent Manner.  The graphs that follow depict the increasing ADCC killing activity of haNK cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of either Herceptin or Rituxan observed in in vitro studies. The comparative killing activity of aNK alone, low-affinity CD16 receptor expressing aNK cells, or laNK, cells, and haNK with a non-relevant antibody as a negative control, are included for direct comparison purposes.
 
Source: J Immunol. 2008 May 1;180(9):6392-401.
 
In the first graph above, aNK, laNK, and haNK cells were tested separately in killing assays against SKOV‑3 ovarian cancer cells in the presence of logarithmically increasing concentrations of Herceptin. The assay was performed by loading the tumor cells with radioactive chromium‑51 and measuring the release by cytotoxicity in a four‑hour assay. haNK cells responded to a lower dose of Herceptin (0.001 ug/mL) and exhibited stronger maximal killing response as compared to cells expressing the low affinity 158F variant. Parental aNK cells, which lack CD16 expression, and haNK cells in combination with non-relevant antibody did not exhibit any ADCC response toward the SKOV‑3 cells.
 In the second graph, haNK cells responded to a lower dose of Rituxan (0.001 ug/mL) and exhibited stronger maximal killing response, as compared to laNK cells. Parental aNK cells, lacking CD16 expression, did not exhibit any ADCC response toward the 721.221 B‑cell lymphoma cells and haNK cells together with non-relevant antibody did not trigger any ADCC response.
 19

Synergy Demonstrated When Combining Two Antibody Products together with haNK Cells.  The graph below depicts the synergistic activity of the combination of Herceptin and Perjeta (HER2/HER3) to mediate ADCC killing observed in in vitro studies. Through the application of haNK cells to kill HER2 positive gastric carcinoma cells, the activity observed in the combination of Herceptin and Perjeta was significantly greater than either agent was alone.
 

20

haNK Enhances the Killing Capacity of the PD‑L1 Checkpoint Inhibitor, Avelumab.  Irradiated haNK cells and MDA‑MB‑231 (human breast carcinoma) cells were used as a target at an E:T ratio of 7.5:1. haNK innate killing (black bars) and innate + ADCC killing mediated by avelumab (grey bars) are shown in the graphs below. While avelumab alone and control Ab alone show no killing and haNK alone demonstrates some killing via innate mechanisms, the combination of haNK and avelumab yields the highest degree of killing, attributable to targeting the PD‑L1 checkpoint protein as a target (a). Separately, it was demonstrated that irradiated haNK cells do not exhibit cytotoxic activity against other haNK cells (fratricide) (b).
 

21

haNK and Avelumab Combination Exhibits Potent Killing Across a Variety of Cancer Types.  As illustrated in the graphs below, avelumab-mediated ADCC by haNK cells demonstrated enhanced killing against a variety of cancer types in four‑hour assays, which was even more pronounced in 18‑hour assays. Both haNK with isotype control (black squares) and haNK with avelumab (blue circles) mediated lysis of H460 human lung carcinoma cells in an E:T dose dependent manner (a). Similar results were also seen with several other human cell lines including cervical cancer CaSki cell (b); HCC4006: lung carcinoma (c); H441: lung carcinoma (d); SKOV3: ovarian carcinoma (e); MDA‑MB‑231: breast carcinoma (f); and HTB‑4: bladder carcinoma (g).
 

22

Rationale for Developing our haNK in Combination with Approved and Late-Stage Antibody Products That Utilize the ADCC Killing Pathway.  In multiple clinical trials conducted by third parties, patients who were homozygous for high-affinity CD16 (158V/V) generally experienced better responses to exogenous antibody therapy than patients who were carriers of a low affinity CD16 allele (158F/F or V/F). The illustration from one study below shows the difference in progression-free survival between HER2 positive breast cancer patients treated with Herceptin who have the homozygous high-affinity form of CD16 and those who are carriers for the low affinity form to be far in excess of 20% at 48 months.
 

23

Data from three clinical trials demonstrating this point are shown below. The rationale therefore is for combining haNK with Rituxan, Herceptin and Erbitux in patients with low affinity CD16 alleles (158F carriers or 158F/F or 158V/F) that it should enhance the killing effect of these antibodies and achieve the results for patients with 158V/V alleles.
 

Antibodies are prevalently used and it is estimated that they generate over $100 billion in reported global annual sales. It has been reported that only approximately 10% to 15% of the addressable patient population for antibody therapies carry high-affinity CD16 receptors. This implies that our haNK product candidates may have significant market potential for these and possibly all IgG1-type antibody products that kill via the ADCC pathway as a combination therapy to address a large number of patients who would otherwise have poor responses to their antibody treatments.

haNK Single Agent Study
 In 2018, we conducted a large part of our phase I first-in-human, open-label study to evaluate safety and preliminary activity and determine the maximum tolerated or feasible dose and the highest dose with acceptable toxicity for infusion in up to 16 subjects with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors, QUILT 3.028. The study was conducted in two parts, the first being a standard dose escalation protocol using a 3 + 3 design, and the second an expansion of the highest dose level with acceptable toxicity to further characterize safety and efficacy. Formal assessment of the safety of haNK is in process by our Safety Review Committee. A preliminary look at the first five patients to receive repeat haNK infusions reported no grade 3 or higher toxicities related to haNK and no dose limiting toxicities. Grade 1 or 2 fever, fatigue, nausea, infusion-related reactions and pain have been reported for most patients. One patient experienced grade 3/4 hyponatremia and another reported grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia, but neither was considered to be related to the administration of the study drug. As of the date of this filing, efficacy data is pending.
 QUantum Immuno-oncology Lifelong Trial, or QUILT, is a master clinical trial protocol designed under cooperative research and development agreements between pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies and the National Cancer Institute, in accordance with published FDA guidance. QUILT studies are designed to harness and orchestrate all of the elements of the immune system, including dendritic cell, T‑cell, and NK cell therapies, by testing novel combinations of vaccines, cell-based immunotherapy, metronomic chemotherapy, low dose radiotherapy and immunomodulators, including checkpoint inhibitors, in patients who have undergone next generation whole genome, transcriptome and quantitative proteomic analysis, with the goal of achieving durable, long-lasting remission for patients with cancer.
 Transition to Cryopreserved haNK Product Candidate
 During the QUILT 3.028 study, our haNK product for infusion was changed from fresh irradiated haNK to frozen irradiated, “off-the-shelf” haNK product. The administration of both products was found to be equally safe and tolerable. The early favorable safety profile established from this first-in-human study paved the way for several successful IND submissions to the FDA for our phase Ib/II haNK combination trials, which we designated as NCV trials.
Building Towards Our First NCV Combination Trial
 After demonstrating phase I safety and activity of aNK monotherapy in both single and repeat dosing, we evaluated haNK monotherapy in a similar fashion in our QUILT 3.028 study, where we studied haNK for infusion in subjects with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors. We next demonstrated safety of the combination of aNK and NCV in pancreatic cancer patients in our QUILT 3.039 study. This was followed by the introduction of haNK to the NCV combination in our QUILT 3.060 study for patients with pancreatic cancer who have progressed on or after standard-of-care therapy. Lastly, we introduced our cryopreserved haNK formulation together with the addition of low-dose Aldoxorubicin and a design change to extend the length of each treatment cycle to three‑weeks, in our QUILT 3.070 study. Should the data be supportive, upon completion of our QUILT 3.070 safety and activity study, we may have an opportunity to transition to a registration trial that would include a standard-of-care comparator arm.
 Additionally, four phase Ib trials investigating haNK in combination with metronomic chemotherapy, an IL‑15 superagonist, a checkpoint inhibitor, cancer vaccines, and stereotactic body radiation therapy in various solid tumor models including QUILT 3.067, QUILT 3.071, QUILT 3.080 and QUILT 3.090 have patients currently in active follow-up. Collectively referred to as the NCV studies, the primary endpoint is to determine safety of the combination treatment and, if safe, a phase II extension with a primary endpoint to determine objective response rate, is planned. By year-end 2018, over 250 doses of haNK (2 × 109 cells per dose) have been administered to subjects with squamous cell carcinomas, pancreatic cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer. No immune-related adverse effects or cytokine release syndrome attributable to haNK have been observed. Transient low-grade fevers have been reported in these haNK recipients when administered in this NCV combination therapy.
 Throughout 2018, we initiated a total of seven NCV studies and have since safely dosed patients. Eligible patients generally include those who have recurrent or metastatic disease and have failed standard-of-care therapy. Cancer types addressed in studies opened in 2018 include triple negative breast, colorectal, pancreatic, and squamous cell carcinoma.
 The following is a list of the phase Ib studies referenced above, that have patients in active follow-up:
 The QUILT 3.067 Study.  Nant Triple Negative Breast Cancer Vaccine: Molecularly informed integrated immunotherapy combining haNK cell therapy with adaptive T‑cell therapy in subjects with triple negative breast cancer who have progressed on or after standard-of-care therapy.
 The QUILT 3.071 Study.  Phase Ib/II trial of the Nant Colorectal Cancer Vaccine vs Regorafenib in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer who have been previously treated with standard-of-care therapy.
 25

The QUILT 3.080 Study.  Phase Ib/II trial of the Nant Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine as treatment for subjects with pancreatic cancer who have progressed on or after standard-of-care therapy.
 The QUILT 3.090 Study.  Nant Squamous Cell Carcinoma Vaccine: Molecularly informed integrated immunotherapy combining innate haNK cell therapy with adaptive T‑cell therapy in subjects with squamous cell carcinoma who have progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and PD‑1/PD‑L1 therapy.
 While this first generation of NCV studies demonstrated the initial safety of our approach and core strategies, we have now fully enrolled all intended patients for these phase Ib studies in early 2019. We expect to conclude treatment of these patients, analyze data and plan pivotal studies based on these results in select indications.
 Quilt 3.063: Phase II Merkel Cell Carcinoma Trial Deploying Novel Triple Combination of “off-the-shelf” haNK Cell Therapy with Superagonist IL‑15 Cytokine Therapy and PD‑L1 Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy
 In addition to the aforementioned NCV studies, we have opened a chemotherapy-free, pivotally-designed immunotherapy trial which builds upon our earlier phase II study that utilized our proprietary, “off-the-shelf” aNK cell therapy and N‑803, which resulted in an objective response in three of seven patients. This new trial will evaluate a combination therapy using our “off-the-shelf” haNK cells as the backbone of the regimen, to which we will add N‑803 and avelumab in subjects with Merkel cell carcinoma that have progressed on or after treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. The combination of these three agents has been safely studied in our NCV trials for other solid cancer indications. The goal of combining these therapies is to synergistically maximize the killing of cancer cells while attempting to spare patients from chemotherapy and its associated adverse side effects. In both in vitro and in vivo studies we conducted, the combination of haNK cells with a number of different therapeutic antibodies, including avelumab, led to enhanced tumor cell killing when compared to the use of the antibody alone. Avelumab, is a checkpoint inhibitor which targets the programmed death-ligand 1 protein, or PD‑L1, commonly expressed on a wide range of cancers. N‑803 has been shown to synergistically activate NK and T‑cells and enhance cancer cell killing in both single agent and combination therapy. When N‑803 is combined with haNK cells, a synergistic response is likewise observed in both in vivo and in vitro models.
 We will determine the safety and efficacy of the triple combination treatment and objective response rate using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 based on blinded independent central review. We will also be obtaining progression-free survival, overall survival, disease-specific survival, duration of response, disease control rate, and quality of life by patient-reported outcomes. Exploratory objectives include the assessment of the pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity profiles, assessment of tumor molecular profiles and therapy-induced changes in immune responses, and molecular changes in cell-free circulating DNA and RNA, and their correlations with subject outcomes.
 Merkel Cell Carcinoma.  Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare and aggressive skin cancer that arises from uncontrolled growth of cells in the skin. Increasing in incidence, approximately 2,500 new cases are reported in the U.S. each year. Patients with metastatic or locally advanced Merkel cell carcinoma have an extremely poor prognosis, with less than 20% of patients surviving longer than five years. Typically, these patients are treated with a range of drugs, including chemotherapy, which can result in significant side effects. Although new immune therapies have the potential to improve survival, Merkel cell carcinoma is still fatal for a majority of patients who have progressed on or after treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor and represents an unmet medical need.
 QUILT 3.063 will be one of our leading clinical development efforts in 2019, as we are currently engaged in study start-up activities at several clinical trial sites and plan to initially expand enrollment to approximately ten centers throughout the U.S. We believe that, if we are able to demonstrate a statistically measurable efficacy for Merkel cell carcinoma, we will be able to apply for marketing approval with the FDA.
 Longer term, we plan to conduct a wide range of additional immunotherapy studies comprising haNK cell therapy in combination with commercially approved antibodies. Based on the preclinical and, eventually, clinical data generated through these studies, we believe we will be able to select additional promising pairings of our haNK product candidate with commercial antibody products for use as the core components in each targeted therapy regimen we develop.

t‑haNK Programs
 Novel, First-in-Class PD‑L1.t‑haNK Product Candidate.
 Introduction.  PD‑L1.t‑haNK is a human, allogeneic, stable clonal NK cell line generated from our parental clinical-grade aNK master cell bank. By combining the potent cell killing mechanism mediated through PD‑L1 CAR targeting with the well-known and potent FcgRIIIa/CD16 mediated ADCC killing mechanism, when used in conjunction with therapeutic IgG1 monoclonal antibodies, we believe that such dual expression would not only be stable, but that each component would also contribute synergistically to constitute a highly potent and selectively active antitumor agent. Our PD‑L1.t‑haNK product stably expresses three primary proteins: (1) a human PD‑L1–targeted CAR; (2) the high-affinity variant of the human IgG1 Fc receptor, FcγRIIIa/CD16 for enhanced ADCC; and (3) a variant of the human IL‑2 cytokine for enhanced function, IL‑2 growth independence and limited extracellular leakage of IL‑2 for improved safety.
 Our PD‑L1.t‑haNK master cell bank is a uniform cell population that can be easily and stably expanded in continuous culture. It has demonstrated exceptionally potent and specific in vitro and in vivo activity against PD‑L1–expressing tumors via CAR-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, since PD‑L1.t‑haNK also expresses the high-affinity CD16 allele, the engineered enhancement of haNK cells, it can also mediate antitumor activity via ADCC when administered in combination with a monoclonal antibody. As such, a dual-targeting approach may be more effective at potentiating antitumor activity in all PD‑L1–expressing solid malignancies, particularly when the appropriate IgG1-type antibody is added to the therapeutic regimen.
 Pre-Clinical Experience.  Nonclinical testing was performed to determine the pharmacologic and toxicologic effects of PD‑L1.t‑haNK, which may be predictive of its clinical safety and efficacy in humans. The nonclinical in vivo studies employed immunocompromised mouse models in order to mitigate rejection of PD‑L1.t‑haNK cells by the xenogenic host species. Nonclinical pharmacology data demonstrated that PD‑L1.t‑haNK cells possess potent in vivo antitumor efficacy as demonstrated in PD‑L1–positive xenograft models. PD‑L1.t‑haNK administration was able to markedly decrease metastatic disease burden and inhibit tumor growth in these tumor-bearing animals.
 A repeat-dose biodistribution study evaluated the dispersion and persistence of a related CAR-expressing t‑haNK cell line, CD19.t‑haNK, following repeated administration in the presence of CD19‑expressing tumors. CD19.t‑haNK cells were detected at very low frequency in the liver and lungs of CD19 tumor-bearing mice six-hours after dosing and were completely undetectable 48-hours after dosing. This study also indicated that the presence of the CD19-targeted CAR construct does not affect the biodistribution pattern of the CD19.t‑haNK cells. Likewise, the presence of a PD‑L1–targeted CAR is not expected to affect the biodistribution of the cells, and the cells are expected to circulate through the blood with accumulation likely occurring in the liver and lungs, and with limited persistence.
 A pivotal toxicity study showed that repeat-dose administration of irradiated PD‑L1.t‑haNK cells in an immunocompromised mouse model was well tolerated and did not result in any significant toxicities, pathological changes, or tumor formation. Additionally, no weight loss, distress, or other treatment-related adverse reactions were observed in any animals. Importantly, the tolerability of repeat-dose administration of PD‑L1.t‑haNK cells was comparable to treatment with other aNK-derived cell lines. In summary, the nonclinical data demonstrated a favorable risk-benefit ratio for PD‑L1.t‑haNK.
 27

As illustrated in the tables that follow, our clinical grade PD‑L1.t‑haNK cell product retains its CD16 expression and the innate killing, CAR mediated killing, and ADCC mediated killing mechanisms all remain fully intact after irradiation and thaw of our final dose form.

Development Plan.  In 2019, we intend to open our first clinical trial for our PD‑L1.t‑haNK product candidate. We anticipate that this study will be an open label phase I study of PD‑L1.t‑haNK in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic relapsed/refractory solid cancers. After evaluation of safety and initial activity, we plan to conduct a wide range of additional immunotherapy studies with this agent in simple combinations to address the PD‑L1 molecular marker across select tumor types leading with non-small cell lung cancer.
 Our initial phase I, first-in-human, open-label study will evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy and determine the maximum tolerated or feasible dose and the highest dose with acceptable toxicity for infusion in subjects in subsequent trials. The study will be conducted in two parts: the first being a standard dose escalation protocol using a 3 + 3 design, and the second, an expansion of the highest dose level with acceptable toxicity to further characterize safety and efficacy.
 By the conclusion of the study, we believe we will have characterized the pharmacologic profile for PD‑L1.t‑haNK, obtained preliminary estimates of efficacy in terms of objective response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival, assessed tumor molecular profiles as well as therapy-induced changes in immune responses and their correlations with subject outcomes.
 CD19.t‑haNK Product Candidate.
 Introduction.  CD19.t‑haNK is a human, allogeneic, stable clonal NK cell line generated from our parental clinical-grade aNK master cell bank. By combining the potent cell killing mechanism mediated through CD19 CAR targeting the B-cell marker CD19 with the well-known and potent FcγRIIIa/CD16 mediated ADCC killing mechanism, when used in conjunction with therapeutic IgG1-type monoclonal antibodies, we believe that such a dual expression would not only be stable, but that each component would also contribute synergistically to constitute a highly potent and selectively active antitumor agent. Our CD19.t-haNK product stably expresses three primary proteins: (1) a CD19–targeted CAR; (2) the high-affinity variant of the human IgG1 Fc receptor, FcγRIIIa/CD16 for enhanced ADCC; and (3) a variant of the human IL‑2 cytokine for enhanced function, IL‑2 growth independence and limited extracellular leakage of IL‑2 for improved safety.
 29

Our CD19.t‑haNK master cell bank is a uniform cell population that can be easily and stably expanded in continuous culture. It has demonstrated potent and specific in vitro and in vivo activity against CD19–expressing tumors via CAR-mediated cytotoxicity. Likewise, it exhibited potent killing through innate mechanisms, including NKG2D and NKp30 receptors. Moreover, since CD19.t‑haNK also expresses the high-affinity CD16 allele, the engineered enhancement of haNK cells, it can also mediate antitumor activity via ADCC when administered in combination with a monoclonal antibody. As such, a tri-targeting approach may be more effective at potentiating antitumor activity in all CD19 expressing liquid tumors, particularly when the appropriate IgG1-type antibody is added to the therapeutic regimen. The in vitro killing plots of our t‑haNK cells against cancer cell lines utilizing CAR, innate and ADCC mechanisms are illustrated in the following slides.

Pre-Clinical Experience.  An array of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology proof-of-concept studies have been performed with CD19.t‑haNK. The in vivo antitumor activity was investigated using a CD19-positive lymphoma cancer line in immunocompromised mouse models. Irradiated CD19.t‑haNK cells were administered intravenously twice per week over a period of three weeks and resulted in statistically significant tumor growth inhibition on and after the first week compared to a control group. In addition, it was observed during necropsy that treatment with CD19.t‑haNK cell treatments reduced liver metastasis, which was further corroborated by histological evaluation. Furthermore, treatment with CD19.t‑haNK was able to reduce the number of animal death events, with 100% of the study subjects alive at the end of the study compared to only 50% of the subjects in the control group. Results from this study are indicative of the potential pharmacological effects of CD19.t‑haNK for infusion in human lymphoma patients.
 To investigate the in vivo biodistribution and persistence of CD19.t‑haNK cells intravenously administered in CD19‑positive Raji tumor-bearing mice, tissues were analyzed at six- and 48-hours after the final dose. CD19.t‑haNK cells were detected at very low frequency in the liver and lungs at six-hours post-dosing, and none were detected at 48-hours post‑dosing. The results of this study are consistent with previous biodistribution studies performed with haNK cells, indicating that the addition of the CD19 CAR does not affect the biodistribution pattern of the cells and that like haNK cells, CD19.t‑haNK cells do not persist in vivo.
 In investigating in vivo toxicity and tumorigenicity of CD19.t‑haNK cells after 28 days of repeat dosing in immunocompromised mice, results showed that all mice receiving product were overall as healthy as the control group throughout the study. There were no mortalities in either of the treatment groups and likewise, no adverse events were observed. Blood and serum samples collected at the end of the study revealed no significant differences between animals receiving drug product and those in the control group. In addition, gross necropsy and macroscopic morphologic examination revealed no tumor masses or organ abnormalities. Subsequent pathological evaluation of harvested tissues confirmed that there was no gross or microscopic evidence of toxicity or tumorigenicity associated with administration of irradiated CD19.t‑haNK cells. We believe the results from this study provide strong support for the safety of cryopreserved, irradiated CD19.t‑haNK cell therapy in human clinical trials.

Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, the most common subtype of non‑Hodgkin’s lymphoma, is a heterogeneous disease. The current standard for first-line therapy is a traditional chemotherapy regimen consisting of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. While approximately 50% to 60% of patients respond well to first-line therapy, approximately 15% to 25% of patients suffer from primary refractory disease, approximately 20% to 30% relapse after achieving a complete response, and 5% achieve only a partial response. Patients that relapse or are refractory to first-line therapy can be treated with one of an array of salvage chemotherapy regimens and if responsive, may subsequently proceed to undertake potentially curative stem cell transplantation. However, patients that are refractory or relapse after two or more lines of therapy, especially those that are not eligible for stem cell transplant or CAR‑T cell therapy, have a very poor prognosis. New therapeutic options are critically needed to address this growing patient population.
 We believe that the combined potential for our CD19.t‑haNK cells to exhibit a robust CAR mediated and ADCC mediated anti-cancer effect against B‑cell malignancies when combined with rituximab or avelumab, given the strong support from our preclinical programs, merits further evaluation in clinical trials to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of CD19.t‑haNK in subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.
 Development Plan.  In 2019, we intend to open our first clinical trial for our CD19.t‑haNK product candidate. We anticipate that this study will be an open-label phase I study of CD19.t‑haNK in subjects with DLBCL who have received two or more lines of therapy and are ineligible for transplant or CAR‑T cell therapy. We will evaluate safety, preliminary efficacy and determine the maximum tolerated or feasible dose and the highest dose with acceptable toxicity for infusion in subjects in subsequent trials. The study will be conducted in two parts: the first being a standard dose escalation protocol using a 3 + 3 design, and the second, an expansion of the highest dose level with acceptable toxicity, to further characterize safety and efficacy.
 Assuming the successful completion of the clinical trial, we believe we will have characterized the pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic profiles for CD19.t‑haNK, obtained preliminary estimates of efficacy in terms of objective response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival, assessed tumor molecular profiles as well as therapy-induced changes in immune responses and their correlations with subject outcomes.
 Additional Potential t‑haNK Product Candidates.
 Depending on the results obtained from our current clinical trial strategy, additional t‑haNK product candidates currently advancing through pre-clinical development, including our HER2, EGFR and BCMA t‑haNK programs, may be rapidly moved into first-in-human trials followed by disease and molecular marker specific studies.
Achievements in Process Development, Scale-Up Manufacturing and Clinical Supply
 Manufacturing has continued to be one of our fastest growing functions in 2018. We made significant strides throughout the year in all of our core manufacturing and ancillary operational areas, including process development, scale-up manufacturing, materials sourcing, completion and certification of production facilities, pipeline buildup of cryopreserved and ready to infuse clinical product, all the way through and including clinical trial supply. An extensive patent portfolio of manufacturing methods applications has been filed to protect this body of pioneering work, which will serve as an added layer of protection to our existing patent estate.
 32

We have been qualifying and releasing frozen haNK since the fourth quarter of 2017. Shelf-life stability for frozen haNK continues to be extended, enabling the accumulation of product inventories for potential immediate on-demand availability. As a result, clinical trial sites will no longer be required to conduct final product formulation and release testing procedures in a special clean room prior to administration. Instead, clinical sites simply need to thaw the frozen product in a warming bath and infuse. These simplified clinical site requirements for product administration potentially expands patient accessibility well beyond select certified hospital centers and deep into the community at outpatient group practices and physician’s offices. Developing the capability to freeze and thaw our cell therapy product while preserving optimal viability and potency was a key goal that we both achieved and continue to refine as we further scale our operations. Our therapeutic platform is flexible and thus our investments in developing manufacturing capabilities have been designed with the ability to introduce new variants of our cell therapies quickly. In 2018, we developed key capabilities for the successful cryopreservation and recovery of our cells, that we believe enables simpler and more cost effective storage and shipment of our cell therapies to patients in clinics that are located at a distance from our manufacturing site.
 

We believe we have unique processing and production capabilities that will enable us to leverage our investments in in-house operations to produce our cell therapy products at scale. These capabilities will help us to reduce our cost of goods sold and realize significant economies of scale. Further, the flexibility of these capabilities to apply to a wide range of new variants of our aNK cells will allow for more rapid scaling of our newly emerging products from our pipeline and the initiation of a new series of clinical programs.
 
33

The Production Process
 Our aNK platform production process largely resembles the widely used monoclonal antibody manufacturing process, without the laborious extraction and purification steps at the end, and bears the least resemblance to that of autologous CAR‑T cell manufacturing. The figure below illustrates the key steps involved with master cell bank establishment, starting with a Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, cell line, in the case of antibody products and with an aNK cell line in the case of haNK, taNK and t‑haNK products. Both utilize genetic engineering to achieve the desired clones, which after selection, are expanded to create master cell banks. From this point, a culture can be initiated from a single vial from the bank that will eventually be able to fill a bioreactor. In both cases, such a bioreactor can run for months with intermittent harvesting over the course of the culture. In the case of antibody products, it is the antibody-rich supernatant that must be separated from the cell culture and then purified before making the bulk product. In the case of haNK, taNK and t‑haNK products, the cell culture is itself the product that simply requires centrifugation and washing before making the final dose forms. A single bioreactor can produce a significant number of doses that can be used to treat many patients.
 

34

The panel below compares the key steps in the manufacture of autologous CAR‑T therapy with that of haNK, taNK and t‑haNK. CAR‑Ts have a high per-unit manufacturing cost due to a series of complex processes, including harvesting T‑cells from patients in an invasive procedure called leukapheresis. Once the T‑cells have been adequately collected, they are sent to the manufacturing facility for individualized processing that starts with genetic engineering and expansion in a dedicated cGMP clean room. Then, through an elaborate series of procedures, the cells are selected using bead removal before a single dose form is prepared and returned to the hospital for infusion back into the original patient. By contrast, the manufacture of our allogeneic “off-the-shelf” haNK, taNK and t‑haNK cells involves a rapid, scalable and cost efficient process where cells from a master cell bank vial are grown in a bioreactor and, once ready to harvest, the cells are centrifuged and washed before placement into final dose forms. One vial from the master cell bank can potentially produce thousands of cryopreserved dose forms that would be available on-demand, without the typical two- to three‑week delay in orchestrating the logistics and preparation involved when using the CAR‑T method.
 

Building Out Our Manufacturing Capabilities
 Over the past year our process and manufacturing teams have worked diligently to scale our operations to meet the anticipated commercial demand for our therapeutic products upon achieving regulatory approvals. The development of this capability has been key to ensure not just sufficient supply for our current and planned clinical trials operations, but also to ensure that we will be able to build an ample inventory of product to meet commercial demand as well as to realize economies of scale for our pipeline of products being readied for the clinic.
 While we initially relied upon external manufacturers, we found that to create a scalable product with a reliable and cost effective clinical supply capability, we needed to build a state of the art GMP facility for the manufacture of all our cell therapeutics. In order to ensure uninterrupted clinical supply, we implemented a dual-stage strategy. In the initial stage, we established a pilot GMP manufacturing facility at our Culver City, California, site and for the second stage we simultaneously built out an approximately 24,250 square foot commercial GMP facility in El Segundo, California. We completed the El Segundo, California, facility buildout in May 2018 and subsequently outfitted and prepared the facility for commercial scale manufacturing, and we expect to initiate clinical production at this facility in early 2019.
 35

Our initial production capabilities involved limited production of the cells in flasks and gas-permeable chambers. By 2016, our company possessed limited laboratory capabilities, as we were still dependent upon university partners and contract manufacturers for all of our cell production capabilities. While these did not yet involve bioreactors, they were sufficient to meet the limited clinical demands for our studies at the time. This foundational work was in part performed using the early production capabilities at Baylor University’s Cell and Gene Therapy Center, in addition to Northwestern University, and a global contract manufacturing vendor. We recognized the serious limitations and inherent risks in relying on external manufacturing sources, including competition for timely slots for external production runs, exorbitant rising costs, reliance on untrained operators, the need to establish contract manufacturing redundancy in the event of a vendor failure and serious limitations in our ability to achieve consistent scale production. We therefore committed to a strategy of in-sourcing this core capability and have since achieved this goal.
 We commenced production operations at our pilot facility in Culver City, California in 2017. It was there that we initialized our in-house GMP bioreactor program for our haNK product, as we progressed production from smaller bioreactor batches to larger ones. In tandem with this improvement in manufacturing capacity, we also established and refined a process to cryopreserve our cell product in ready-to-infuse bags and then integrated it with our main process into a single production line.
 

36

In 2018, we further increased the scale of our operations twice more by utilizing intermediate-sized bioreactor technologies and were able to outpace demand for clinical drug product while building an inventory of frozen product for future use. In anticipation of increased clinical trial enrollment for 2019, in the final months of 2018 we transferred clinical production operations from our pilot facility in Culver City to our new commercial facility in El Segundo. At present, we are operating fully independent of external manufacturing contractors and partners and have since realized significant improvements in quality, cost and time.
 

37

Looking forward, we are preparing to implement our latest third-generation bioreactor technology in 2019, which was developed at our San Diego, California, process development facility in 2018. This will once again improve our economies of scale, as demand for clinical drug product increases. We believe large capacity bioreactors will allow us to scale beyond regulatory approval from a central location while meeting commercial drug product demands nationwide as well as ultimately on a global scale.
 

38

Manufacturing of our t-haNK Product Candidates
 In 2018, we developed manufacturing processes for our two lead products from our t‑haNK platform, PD‑L1.t‑haNK and CD19.t‑haNK, at our approximately 44,700 square foot San Diego process development facility. Adding to our already robust patent portfolio, we filed numerous patents protecting innovative methods and modifications to our bioreactor production procedures, media formulations, additives, special cryopreservation procedures and many other components that address the inherent production challenges unique to large scale NK cell production. This places NantKwest at a unique competitive advantage as a leader in commercial scale manufacturing of NK cell products.
 

Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that our base proprietary aNK platform, differentiated haNK, taNK and t‑haNK product candidates, strategic collaborations and cell-based immunotherapy expertise may provide us with competitive advantages. However, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. The key competitive factors affecting the success of any approved product will include its efficacy, safety profile, pricing, and method of administration as well as the level of promotional activity invested in it.
 Our haNK, taNK and t‑haNK product candidates will compete with other cell and molecule-based immunotherapy approaches using and/or targeting NK, T‑, and dendritic cells. Competitors focused on CAR‑T related treatment approaches include AbbVie Inc., Intrexon Corporation, Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., JW Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Amgen, Inc., Leucid Bio Ltd., Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Medisix Therapeutics Pte Ltd., Bluebird Bio, Inc., Mesoblast Ltd., Calibr/Scripps Research, Mustang Bio, Inc., CARsgen Therapeutics, Nanjing Legend Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Cartherics Pty Ltd, Novartis AG, Celgene Corporation, Pfizer, Inc., Cellectis SA, Poseida Therapeutics, Inc., Celularity, Inc., Servier Laboratories, Celyad SA, Takeda/Shire, Fortress Biotech, Inc., TC BioPharm Ltd., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Transposagen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Humanigen, Inc., Unum Therapeutics, Inc., Immune Therapeutics, Inc., and Xyphos, Inc. Competitor companies focused on other T‑cell based approaches include Cell Medica Limited, GlaxoSmithKline plc., Green Cross LabCell Corp., Immunocore Limited, Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc., Kiadis Pharma Netherlands B.V., Lion TCR Pte., Ltd., MolMed, S.p.A., Precision Biosciences, Inc., and Takara Bio, Inc. Competitor companies focused on dendritic cell based approaches include Argos Therapeutics, Inc., Biovest International, Inc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., Immune Design, Inc., Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Intrexon Corporation, Medigene AG, and Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc. Competitor companies focused on NK cell based approaches include CytoSen Therapeutics, Inc., Dragonfly Therapeutics, Inc., Fate Therapeutics, Inc., Gamida Cell, Ltd., Nkarta Therapeutics, Inc., and Ziopharm Oncology, Inc. Large molecule focused immunotherapy competitors include Cytomx Therapeutics, Inc., Innate Pharma SA, and Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. Other potential immunotherapy competitors include Glycostem Therapeutics BV and GT Biopharma, Inc. There are currently two approved T‑cell based treatments which are marketed by Novartis AG and Gilead Sciences/Kite Pharma. There is currently one approved dendritic cell-based cancer vaccine which is marketed by Dendron Pharmaceuticals, LLC for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.
 39

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do as well as significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any treatment we may commercialize, and they may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments.
 Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, and establishing clinical study sites and subject registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new therapies enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have a better safety profile, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that our therapeutic products, if approved, will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We seek to consistently file follow-on patent applications on further improvements and features of our NK cell-based products, thereby adding additional layers of protection and reducing reliance on our original patents that would be the earliest to expire and may be subject to challenge. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of NK cell-based immunotherapy. We expect to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, patent term adjustments and patent term extensions when available, as well as on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 We have developed and in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and we possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of NK cell-based immunotherapy product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology. As of December 31, 2018, our owned and licensed patent portfolio consists of patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. disclosing subject matter directed to certain of our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements and our most advanced product candidates, as well as licensed and owned patents and pending applications in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., that, in many cases, are counterparts to the foregoing U.S. patents and patent applications. For example, these patents and patent applications include claims directed to:

 As for the NK cell-based immunotherapy products and processes we develop and commercialize, in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue, when possible, composition, method of use, dosing and formulation patent protection. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technology. The patents and patent applications outside of the U.S. in our portfolio are held primarily in Europe, Canada, Australia, China, Japan and Korea.
 Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the U.S. are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The patent term may be adjusted to compensate for delayed patent issuance, when such delays are caused by the patent office or successful appeals against patent office actions. There is no limit on this patent term adjustment. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the U.S. varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. Our issued patents will expire at various dates through 2025. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire at various dates through 2038. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immunotherapy has emerged in the U.S. The patent situation outside of the U.S. is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the U.S. and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products and the methods used to manufacture those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. However, the area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.

As of December 31, 2018, our registered trademark portfolio contained 15 registered trademarks in the U.S., 32 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions (seven of which are Madrid Protocol trademarks), and ten pending trademark applications in foreign jurisdictions. We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Intellectual Property” and “Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report.
 Collaboration Agreements
 Altor BioScience, LLC.  In August 2016, we entered into an exclusive Co-Development Agreement, or the Co-Development Agreement, with Altor BioScience, LLC, or Altor, formerly known as Altor BioScience Corporation. Altor is a related party, as it is a wholly owned subsidiary of NantCell, which is an affiliate of NantWorks. Under the Co-Development Agreement, we agreed with Altor to exclusively collaborate on the development of therapeutic applications combining our proprietary natural killer cells with Altor's N‑801 and/or N‑803 products with respect to certain technologies and intellectual property rights as may be agreed between the parties for the purpose of jointly developing therapeutic applications of certain effector cell lines.

 Licenses
 Viracta.  In May 2017, we entered into an agreement with Viracta Therapeutics, Inc., or Viracta, to grant us exclusive worldwide rights to Viracta’s phase II drug candidate, VRx‑3996, for use in combination with our platform of natural killer cell therapies. Our Chairman and CEO is also the Vice Chairman of Viracta. In consideration for the license, we are obligated to pay to Viracta (i) mid-single digit percentage royalties of net sales of licensed products for therapeutic use, and (ii) milestone payments ranging from $10.0 million to $25.0 million for various regulatory approvals and cumulative net sales levels. We may terminate the agreement, in our sole discretion, in whole or on a product-by-product and/or country by country basis, at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach or for bankruptcy of the other party.

Hans G. Klingemann, M.D., Ph.D.  We hold the worldwide rights, title and interest to the NK‑92 cell line and we believe that we control commercial use of our NK‑92 cells in key territories. We also maintain and exclusively control the only clinical grade master cell bank for NK‑92. The original NK‑92 cell line was isolated by Hans G. Klingemann, M.D., Ph.D., our founder and Vice President of Research and Development, and all patents and patent applications pertaining to this cell line are now in the name of NantKwest, Inc. or ZelleRx Corporation, our former name. In February 2003, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license from Dr. Klingemann to the NK‑92 cell line, and related NK‑92 patents and know-how, that had been assigned to him by the British Columbia Cancer Agency, to manufacture, use and sell products covered by the scope of any valid claim in any of the licensed patents. Dr. Klingemann subsequently assigned the cell line and those patents to us, but we are still obligated to pay a single-digit royalty on sales of licensed products to Dr. Klingemann, as well as to pay the British Columbia Cancer Agency a small percentage of our profits from the sale of the NK‑92 cell line that Dr. Klingemann obtained from them.
 Fox Chase Cancer Center.  In July 2004, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Fox Chase Cancer Center, or Fox Chase, pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patents and know-how pertaining to CD16 receptors-bearing NK‑92 cell lines. We agreed to pay Fox Chase low single-digit royalties on sales of licensed products. We are also obligated to pay Fox Chase a percentage of the royalties and other compensation we receive from sublicensees of our rights from Fox Chase. Fox Chase is obligated to assign the licensed patents to us if we commence a phase III clinical trial of a licensed product and, if this does not occur, our license expires when the last of the licensed patents expires.
 Rush University Medical Center.  In March 2004, we entered into a license agreement with Rush University Medical Center, or Rush, pursuant to which Rush granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain intellectual property related to clinical use of NK‑92 to develop and commercialize products and processes for the treatment of melanoma renal cancer, or for the diagnosis or treatment of non-melanoma and non-renal cancer. In consideration for the license, we are obligated to pay to Rush single-digit royalties on sales of licensed products with a minimum royalty payment of $25,000 per year, as well as non-material milestone payments upon completion of certain clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones. We also agreed to pay to Rush a portion of certain payments that we receive under sublicensing arrangements. The license has a term of 12 years from 2006, the year in which royalty payments were first made, and includes customary termination rights for both parties. Beginning in 2019, this license converted to a perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid royalty-free, exclusive license.
 University Health Network.  In May 2005, we entered into a license agreement with University Health Network, or UHN, pursuant to which we obtained from UHN an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain intellectual property relating to NK‑92 clinical trials data from UHN to develop and commercialize products and processes for the diagnosis and treatment of certain hematological malignancies. Our license from UHN will automatically expire if we have not filed for regulatory approval or launched a licensed product within specified periods of time, and also includes other customary termination rights for both parties.
Joint Development and License Agreements
 Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.  In December 2014, we entered into a Joint Development and License Agreement with Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., or Sorrento. The agreement expired in December 2017. Since no joint product candidates were identified during the exclusive term, Sorrento has no rights to use the Company’s NK cells or other technologies or intellectual property rights or to begin related research, development or commercialization activities and the Company is free to pursue, and is actively pursuing, research, development and commercialization activities with antibodies that may bind to various targets.
 Intrexon Corporation.  In February 2010, we entered into a 17‑year agreement with Intrexon Corporation, or Intrexon, pursuant to which we granted to Intrexon a worldwide, sublicensable license which may be exclusive with respect to certain indications designated by Intrexon, under certain patents relating to NK‑92 cells to develop and commercialize modified NK‑92 cells that express Intrexon’s proprietary gene sequences for use as therapeutic and prophylactic agents in humans in specified therapeutic areas. Intrexon paid us a one-time license fee and is also obligated to pay non-material milestone payments with respect to specific indications, a royalty on net sales of the licensed products and a portion of the revenue Intrexon receives from third party sublicensees of its rights from us. Intrexon has the right to terminate the agreement upon 180 days’ notice and both parties have the right to terminate the agreement for the other’s uncured breach of the agreement.

Chemotherapeutisches Forschungsinstitut Georg-Speyer-Haus, or GSH, and DRK-Blutspendedienst Baden-Wurttemberg-Hessen gGmbH, or BSD, License Agreement.  In August 2015, we entered into a license agreement with GSH and BSD under which we were granted an exclusive license to certain GSH‑BSD patents, materials and know-how that specifically targets ErbB2 expressing cancers. In addition, GSH granted us an exclusive license to certain GSH only technology and materials. In consideration for the licenses, we agreed to pay initial and annual licensing fees, regulatory and commercial milestones, and low single-digit percentage royalties on net sales of licensed products. In October 2018, we terminated this agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement largely due to the rapid advancement and clinical readiness of our virus-free tri- and quad-cistronic t‑haNK platforms. These next-generation products avoid the safety concerns associated with the use of retro and lentiviral sequences, include high-affinity CD16 for enhanced antibody mediated killing, as well as IL‑2 and other functional components which can potentially enhance clinical efficacy and reduce production costs. IND-enabling studies for our internally developed HER2NEU.t‑haNK product is currently in preparation and will follow the regulatory development path previously forged by our CD19 and PD‑L1.t‑haNK programs.
 We have licensed or sub-licensed our cell lines and intellectual property to numerous other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for non-clinical uses such as laboratory testing. Such licenses generally require the licensee to pay an upfront fee and annual research and commercial fees for products sold using our intellectual property and cell lines.
 Supply Agreements
 In 2018, we entered into various supply agreements with third parties to provide investigational agents to be used in our clinical trials.
 Anticipated Agreements and Considerations
 In addition to the collaboration and license agreements discussed above, we may enter into a commercial agreement relating to an IL‑15 superagonist product developed by an affiliate, and we are also pursuing certain strategic research and/or license agreements with third parties to develop our candidate pipeline. These types of collaboration agreements do not typically specify how sales will be apportioned between the parties upon successful commercialization of the product. As a result, we cannot guarantee that we will receive a percentage of the revenue that is at least proportional to the costs that we will incur in commercializing the product candidate. Furthermore, if Dr. Soon-Shiong was to cease his affiliation with us or with NantWorks, any affiliated entities may be unwilling to continue their relationships with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which in turn may impede our ability to control the supply chain for our combination therapies.
Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or cGLP, regulation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee for each clinical site before the clinical trial is begun;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, after completion of all required clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 44

 
• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the U.S., which must be updated annually and when significant changes are made.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30‑day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 When a clinical trial using genetically engineered cells is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving National Institutes of Health, or NIH, funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, and many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, a federal advisory committee that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety, or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public. If the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
  
• | Phase I. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 45

 
• | Phase III. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase IV. In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called phase IV studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Phase I, phase II and phase III testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees typically increase annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been filed, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 46

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter, a complete response letter, or a not approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter may request additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or other restrictions to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more phase IV post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A fast track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a breakthrough therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-phase II meeting with the FDA. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller or more efficient clinical trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis. We may seek designation as a breakthrough therapy for some or all of our product candidates.
 Fast track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 47

Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the U.S. will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us, and any third party manufacturers, that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA.
 Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 48

 
• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, and exclusion from participation in governmental health programs, like Medicare and Medicaid. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Our sales, promotion, medical education, clinical research and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional federal and state laws similar to the foregoing.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the knowing and willing, direct or indirect offer, receipt, solicitation or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients, including the purchase, order or lease of any good, facility, item or service that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. The government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors.
 Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, or FCA, imposes liability on persons or entities that, among other things, knowingly present or cause to be presented claims that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed for payment or approval by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons or entities that “cause” the submission of claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, submitting claims for services not provided as claimed, or submitting claims for services that were provided but not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General, or as a qui tam action by a private individual, in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other illegal sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, certain companies that were found to be in violation of the FCA have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, restricting the manner in which they conduct their business.

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors; knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; and willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. In addition, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our products, once commercialized, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Covered manufacturers are required to collect and report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data to the government each year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Additionally, entities that do not comply with mandatory reporting requirements may be subject to a corporate integrity agreement. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on covered manufacturers’ marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements on certain health care providers, plans and clearinghouses (collectively, “covered entities”) and their “business associates,” relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain states have their own laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and/or HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and future earnings, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 In addition to the foregoing health care laws, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We adopted an anti-corruption policy in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock in July 2015. The anti-corruption policy mandates compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws applicable to our business throughout the world. However, we cannot assure you that such a policy or procedures implemented to enforce such a policy will protect us from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.

Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement are provided by third-party payors. Third-party payors include state and federal government health care programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, we cannot be certain of this. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the cost-effectiveness, and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective and thus may not be covered or sufficiently reimbursed. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, as each payor will make its own determination as to whether to cover a product and at what level of reimbursement. Thus, one payor’s decision to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that another payor will provide coverage or that the reimbursement levels will be adequate. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
Healthcare Reform
 The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our potential drug candidates are:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include, among others, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which mandates aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
 We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs. Furthermore, the current presidential administration and Congress may continue to attempt broad sweeping changes to the current health care laws. We face uncertainties that might result from modifications or repeal of any of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those changes on us and potential effect on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as a whole is currently unknown. However, any changes to the Affordable Care Act are likely to have an impact on our results of operations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operation. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. may have on our business.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the U.S. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 161 employees. Personnel of related companies who provide corporate, general and administrative, manufacturing strategy, research and development, regulatory and clinical trial strategy and other administrative support services under our shared services agreement with NantWorks are not included in this number. For additional information, see Note 9 – Related Party Agreements of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our management systems, recruit and train new employees and select qualified independent contractors. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Corporate Information
 We were incorporated on October 7, 2002 in the state of Illinois under the name ZelleRx Corporation. On January 22, 2010, we changed our name to Conkwest, Inc. In March 2014, we formed Conkwest, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary in the state of Delaware, or Conkwest Delaware, for the purposes of changing the state of our incorporation to the state of Delaware. In March 2014, we merged with and into Conkwest Delaware, with Conkwest Delaware surviving the merger. On July 10, 2015, we changed our name to NantKwest, Inc. Our website address is www.nantkwest.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10‑K. We provide free of charge through a link on our website access to our Annual Reports on Form 10‑K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10‑Q and Current Reports on Form 8‑K, as well as amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practical after the reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
