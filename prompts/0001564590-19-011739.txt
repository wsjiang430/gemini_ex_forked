Company Background and Corporate Structure 
 American Electric Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”, “AETI”, “our”, “us” or “we”) was incorporated on October 21, 1996 as a Florida corporation. On May 15, 2007, we completed a business combination (the “M&I Merger”) with M&I Electric Industries, Inc.

 Our corporate structure currently consists of American Electric Technologies, Inc., which owns 100% of M&I Electric Industries, Inc., including its wholly-owned subsidiary, South Coast Electric Systems, LLC (“SCES”) and M&I Electric Brazil Sistemas e Servicios em Energia LTDA (“M&I Brazil”). On August 12, 2018, all of the U.S. business operations of M&I Electric Industries, Inc. based in the United States (“U.S.”) were sold to an affiliate of Myers Power Products, Inc.

Foreign Joint Venture 
 We use a foreign joint venture to accommodate business in China. We believe our foreign joint venture provides a prudent way to diversify and reduce the risk of international expansion, capitalize on the strengths and the relationships of our foreign joint venture partners with potential customers, and achieve competitive advantages. Our ownership interests in our foreign joint venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and results reported in equity income.
 China. In March 2006, M&I Electric entered into a joint venture agreement with Baoji Oilfield Machinery Co., Ltd., (“BOMCO”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Corporation, and AA Energies, Inc. of Houston, Texas, which markets oilfield equipment, to form BOMAY Electric Industries Co., Ltd. (“BOMAY”), as an equity joint venture limited liability company organized in China. M&I is a 40% interest owner in BOMAY with 51% being owned by BOMCO and the remaining 9% owned by AA Energies, Inc. BOMAY manufactures power and control systems for land drilling rigs. M&I has invested 16 million Yuan (approximately $2 million USD) in this joint venture in which M&I provides technology and services to BOMAY. Each of the BOMAY investors may be required to guarantee the bank loans of BOMAY in proportion to their investment. No guarantees have been provided by The Company at this time. The joint venture had an initial 12-year term which expired in 2018. In March 2018, BOMAY’s Board of Directors approved a ten-year extension of the joint venture agreement.

Marketing  
 Our business is generally obtained through a competitive bid process where the lowest bid from pre-qualified suppliers is awarded the project. Depending on the market segment, we either sell directly to the end user or owner, a shipyard or rig user, or, sell to an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) firm representing the end project owner or an offshore vessel company.
Competition 
 Our products and services are sold in highly competitive South American markets. We compete in all of our markets and regions with a number of companies, some of which have financial and other resources comparable to or greater than us. Due to the demanding operating conditions in the energy sector and the high costs associated with project delays and equipment failure, we believe customers in this industry prefer suppliers with a track record of proven, reliable performance in their specific energy related project type. We seek to build strong long-term relationships with our customers by providing high-quality, efficient and reliable products and services, developing new products and services and responding promptly to our customers’ needs. 
 The principal competitive factors in our markets are product and service quality, reliability, lead time, price, technical expertise and reputation. 
 We believe our principal competitive strengths include the following: 
 Our power delivery, control and drive systems can be custom-designed and are built to meet our customers’ specific requirements. 
 Our commitment to providing quality products and services, fair pricing, innovation and customer service is the foundation to the long-standing customer relationships that we enjoy with an attractive customer base. 
 Our operations in Brazil are led by an experienced management team with a proven track record. We believe the experience of our management team provides us with an in-depth understanding of our customers’ needs and enhances our ability to deliver customer-driven solutions. We believe our management has fostered a culture of loyalty, resulting in high employee retention rates for our professional and technical employees. 
 The Company has multiple competitive advantages for our products and services:
  
• | Technically trained service personnel;
--+---------------------------------------


• | ISO 9000 and Ex certified motor repair facility;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Established, close working foreign relationships;
