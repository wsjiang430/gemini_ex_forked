Company Information 
 
Mineral Mountain Mining & Milling Company (hereinafter “Mineral Mountain”, the “Company” or “We”) was incorporated in Idaho on August 4, 1932. The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 13 Bow Circle, Suite 170, Hilton Head, South Carolina 29928, and our telephone number is (917) 587-8153. Any information on, or that may be accessed through, any websites (other than government websites) is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report and should not be considered a part of this Annual Report. The Company is a publicly traded company listed on the OTCQB exchange. Our common stock is traded under the symbol “MMMM.” On December 31, 2018, the closing sale price of the common stock on the OTCQB was $.19 per share.
 
Mineral Mountain is a “smaller reporting company,” as defined by applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC pursuant to § 229.10(f)(1), in the Securities Act of 1933. As such, we are eligible for exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. We will remain a smaller reporting company until we have a public offering, or value attributable to stock held by non-affiliates, of at least $250 million, as measured on the prior March 31st.
 
The Company’s Recent History and Business
 
Mineral Mountain is in the business of mineral exploration and development. The Company presently owns or leases two mining project properties, the Iditarod Project located in Flat, Alaska, and the Wyoming Project located in Lewiston, Wyoming.
 
Beginning in the late 1980’s or early 1990’s, Mineral Mountain was headed by Don Hess for roughly twenty years until his death around 2009, at which time his daughter Delaine (Hess) Gruber took management control over the Company. At that time, the Company held four mining claims located in the Silver Valley near the famous Sunshine Mine. New management was brought in by Delaine Gruber in 2010 with an eye toward moving the Company forward. Between 2010 and 2015, the Company did not generate significant revenues and its assets apparently did not exceed $1 million in any given year. The Company went through name changes in furtherance of business development opportunities. The Company’s name changed from Mineral Mountain to Score Technologies Inc. on October 6, 2014. At this time, the Company was looking to expand into the technology software business because it acquired the rights to and was further developing certain mobile phone video streaming application technology. As a result of a potential conflict with the Score name, the Company changed its name to Multiplexed Encryption Technologies on March 9, 2015. The Company was unable to get a working prototype of the video streaming app approved for application on Apple’s mobile devices. Therefore, on February 1, 2016, the Company changed its name back to the original Mineral Mountain Mining & Milling Co. so that the Company’s management could focus on its core mineral property exploration and development business. This resulted in Mineral Mountain’s involvement in its current projects in Alaska and Wyoming.

The Wyoming Project (known as the “Gyorvary Property”) is located in the Orogenic Gold District approximately 29.5 miles south-southeast of Lander, Fremont County, Wyoming in the southern end of the Wind River Mountain Range in west central Wyoming. The Gyorvary Property is located in the Lewiston Mining District. The Lewiston Mining District is centered on high grade gold bearing veins in the South Pass Greenstone belt. See Figure 1. The Gyorvary property consists of 16 unpatented and 6 patented mining claims. The Project is a near term producer; nearby the mining claims is an existing permitted mill which is available for a processing charge on a per ton basis. The Project has 423 acres with numerous historical mines and near term mining potential.
 
The Iditarod Project is in an area with promising geochemistry, rocks and soil. It is a large property consisting of 16.5 square miles, located 7 miles from Alaska’s third largest placer district near Flat where historically there have been 1,453,000 ounces of gold produced from 1908 until 1966 along with byproducts of silver, tungsten and mercury. It has an excellent infrastructure with a well maintained airstrip. It has the same rocks as the Iditarod-Nixon Fork Fault and has Tomestone Granites intruding sediments on the major structure.
 
We believe there are no contamination issues of soil, and surface and groundwater resulting from historical activities at the Company’s properties.
 
Our Strategy and Opportunity
 
The Company’s strategy is to identify and invest in mining properties in established precious metal mining zones. We do this in an effort to identify mining assets that provide potentially substantial returns on equity. We intend to use the revenue we generate to fund the exploration and exploitation of present and future mining operations in a cost effective manner. We also intend in the near future to take advantage of additional capital investment opportunities to further our development of existing and future acquired mining properties and pursuing other revenue generating business opportunities. The net proceeds of the revolving credit line which is discussed in this Annual Report will be used for, among other things, general corporate purposes, which may include: (i) acquisitions; (ii) refinancing or repayment of indebtedness; (iii) capital expenditures and working capital; (iv) investing in equipment and property development (which may include funding associated with exploration); and (v) pursuing other business opportunities, both related and unrelated to our existing mining activities. In the event that we seek to pursue new business opportunities unrelated to our existing activities using proceeds from the Equity Purchase Agreement, or from other sources, whether through debt or equity, of which there can be no assurance, we may be required to engage the services of third-parties to assist us in pursuing any potential new opportunities. Any such efforts will be with the view of hopefully generating cash flow from operations, which our existing mining activities have not accomplished. 
Our Capital Structure
 
We have one class of voting common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to vote on matters submitted to our stockholders. We have 100,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, of which 65,619,733 (a/o December 31, 2018) are presently outstanding. Additionally we have 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized of which no preferred shares are presently outstanding.
 
As a result of the common stock that they hold and their placement on the Board of Directors, Sheldon Karasik, our CEO, Chairman and a Director, along with the three independent directors and former executive officers and directors who are affiliates as of December 31, 2018, exercise voting rights with respect to an aggregate of 18,400,000 shares of common stock, which will represent approximately 28.04% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of the date of this Annual Report. Together with the holders of the other closely held shares of common stock, they control more than 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, Mr. Karasik has the ability to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders or Board of Directors for approval, including the election, removal, and replacement of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. If Mr. Karasik’s employment with us is terminated, he will continue to have the ability to exercise the same significant voting power and potentially control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.
 
This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support. Conversely, this concentrated control could allow our Directors to consummate a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. In addition, our directors may make long-term strategic investment decisions and take risks that may not be successful and may seriously harm our business.
 
Employees
 
Mineral Mountain has one full-time employee, its CEO, Sheldon Karasik. From time to time, Mineral Mountain uses several contractors and contract services for exploration as well as administrative functions such as legal, clerical, and bookkeeping. Mr. Karasik expects to devote 160 to 240 hours per month on the Company on a year round basis. Mr. Karasik is responsible for the legal, management, accounting and administrative functions of the Company as well as capital raising and investor relationships.

Government Compliance 
 
Our activities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations. These statutes regulate the mining of and exploration for mineral properties, and also the possible effects of such activities upon the environment. Future legislation and regulations could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in the development of the Company’s properties, the extent of which cannot be predicted. Also, permits from a variety of regulatory authorities are required for many aspects of mine operation and reclamation. In the context of environmental permitting, including the approval of reclamation plans, we must comply with known standards, existing laws and regulations that may entail greater or lesser costs and delays, depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and how stringently the regulations are implemented by the permitting authority. We are not presently aware of any specific material environmental constraints affecting our properties that would preclude the economic development or operation of any specific property. 
 
If our properties merit additional exploration or extraction work, it is reasonable to expect that compliance with environmental regulations will increase our costs. Such compliance may include feasibility studies on the surface impact of our proposed operations, costs associated with minimizing surface impact, water treatment and protection, reclamation activities, including rehabilitation of various sites, on-going efforts at alleviating the mining impact on wildlife and permits or bonds as may be required to ensure our compliance with applicable regulations. It is possible that the costs and delays associated with such compliance could become prohibitive in relation to our properties. 
 
The Company’s primary, near term cost of compliance with applicable environmental laws during exploration may rise in connection with the reclamation of drill holes and access roads. Drill holes typically can be reclaimed for nominal costs. For example, the Bureau of Land Management, an agency of the U.S. Department of Interior has promulgated surface management regulations which govern drill hole and access road reclamation on Bureau of Land Management lands. Similar regulations can be expected to be complied with on the Company’s lands which are on U.S. Forest Service lands, or state property for which we have been issued mineral licenses. 
 
As the Company has yet to conduct any road construction or drilling programs, neither drill hole nor access road reclamation costs have been incurred. Drill hole reclamation costs would only be incurred if drilling were completed. These costs could vary from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars per drill hole site. Whereas roads will not be built until the Company’s exploration programs are more advanced, drill road reclamation costs will vary according to the amount of road construction, which the Company cannot estimate at this time. Once a plan of exploration has been submitted and where drill holes or access roads will be undertaken, the Company will be required to post reclamation bonds. It is difficult to estimate what the cost of such bonds will be, since the bonding requirements are unique to the proposed exploration plan. However, it is a reasonable assumption that in some circumstances these bonds may be a significant percentage of the exploration costs.
 
Competition
 
We compete with other exploration and mining companies to acquire and maintain favorable land positions. We protect the properties we own by complying with regulations and staying current on all fee requirements relating to our properties.
