     Item 1. Business.
     GENERAL
 Overview
     We are a multi-strategy real estate finance company that originates, acquires, finances, and services SBC loans, SBA loans, residential mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent, MBS collateralized primarily by SBC loans, or other real estate-related investments. Our loans range in original principal amounts up to $35 million and are used by businesses to purchase real estate used in their operations or by investors seeking to acquire small multi-family, office, retail, mixed use or warehouse properties. Our origination and acquisition platforms consist of the following four operating segments:
· | SBC Originations. We originate SBC loans secured by stabilized or transitional investor properties using multiple loan origination channels through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ReadyCap Commercial, LLC (“ReadyCap Commercial”). These originated loans are generally held-for-investment or placed into securitization structures. Additionally, as part of this segment, we originate and service multi-family loan products under Freddie Mac’s small balance loan program (the “Freddie Mac program”). These originated loans are sold.

· | SBA Originations, Acquisitions and Servicing. We acquire, originate and service owner-occupied loans guaranteed by the SBA under the SBA Section 7(a) loan program through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ReadyCap Lending, LLC (“ReadyCap Lending”). We hold an SBA license as one of only 14 non-bank Small Business Lending Companies (“SBLCs”) and have been granted preferred lender status by the SBA. In the future, we may originate SBC loans for real estate under the SBA 504 loan program, under which the SBA guarantees subordinated, long-term financing. These originated loans are either held-for-investment, placed into securitization structures, or sold.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Loan Acquisitions. We acquire performing and non-performing SBC loans and intend to continue to acquire these loans as part of our business strategy. We hold performing SBC loans to term, and we seek to maximize the value of the non-performing SBC loans acquired by us through proprietary loan modification programs. We typically acquire non-performing loans at a discount to their unpaid principal balance (“UPB”) when we believe that resolution of the loans will provide attractive risk-adjusted returns.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Residential Mortgage Banking. In connection with our merger with ZAIS Financial Corp. on October 31, 2016, we added a residential mortgage loan origination segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary, GMFS, LLC ("GMFS"). GMFS originates residential mortgage loans eligible to be purchased, guaranteed or insured by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, USDA and VA through retail, correspondent and broker channels. These originated loans are then sold to third parties. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. In order to achieve this objective, we intend to continue to grow our investment portfolio and we believe that the breadth of our full service real estate finance platform will allow us to adapt to market conditions and deploy capital in our asset classes and segments with the most attractive risk-adjusted returns.
     We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). So long as we qualify as a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders. We are organized in a traditional umbrella partnership REIT (“UpREIT”) format pursuant to which we serve as the general partner of, and conduct substantially all of our business through Sutherland Partners, LP, or our operating partnership, which serves as our operating partnership subsidiary. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to be excluded from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act.

 Our Path to Becoming a Public Company 
     Our history of acquiring SBC loans traces back to August 2007 when the Victoria series of funds (“Victoria Funds”) made their initial acquisition of an equity tranche of an SBC loan securitization. The Victoria Funds were formed and managed by our Manager to invest in a range of loan products requiring active management to generate returns. Our business was operated as part of the Victoria Funds until November of 2011 at which time the Victoria Funds contributed substantially all of their SBC loans to our operating partnership in exchange for substantially all of the operating partnership’s units, representing $371.5 million in assets and $262.2 million of equity capital. In November of 2013, we completed the private placement of shares of common stock and operating partnership units (“OP units”), pursuant to which we raised approximately $226 million of equity capital (the “2013 private placement”). Concurrently with the closing of the 2013 private placement, we engaged in a series of transactions, referred to as the REIT formation transactions, in order to allow us to conduct our business as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As part of these transactions, we became a Maryland corporation.
     On October 31, 2016, we completed our path to becoming a publicly traded company through our merger with and into a subsidiary of ZAIS Financial, with ZAIS Financial surviving the merger and changing its name to Sutherland Asset Management Corporation. Prior to and as a condition to the merger, ZAIS Financial disposed of its seasoned re-performing mortgage loan portfolio, such that upon the completion of the merger, ZAIS Financial’s assets largely consisted of its GMFS origination subsidiary, cash, conduit loans, and residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”).  Additionally, prior to the closing of the merger, ZAIS Financial completed a tender offer, purchasing 4,185,478 shares of common stock from existing ZAIS Financial stockholders at a purchase price of $15.37 per share. In connection with the merger, 25,870,420 shares of common stock were issued to our pre-merger common stockholders and 2,288,663 units in the operating partnership subsidiary (“OP units”) were issued to our pre-merger OP unit holders. Our pre-merger stockholders held approximately 86% of our stockholders’ equity as a result of the merger, with continuing ZAIS Financial stockholders holding approximately 14% of our stockholders’ equity, on a fully diluted basis. We were designated as the accounting acquirer because of our larger pre-merger size relative to ZAIS Financial, the relative voting interests of our stockholders after consummation of the merger, and our senior management and board of directors continuing on after the consummation of the merger.  Because we were designated as the accounting acquirer, our historical financial statements (and not those of ZAIS Financial) are the historical financial statements following the consummation of the merger and are included in this annual report on Form 10-K.  On November 1, 2016, we began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under ticker symbol “SLD”. 
     On September 26, 2018, we filed Articles of Amendment to our charter (the “Articles of Amendment”) with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, to change our name to Ready Capital Corporation. In addition, we amended and restated our bylaws and the second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership, effective September 26, 2018, each solely the reflect the name change.
     In connection with the name change, our trading symbol on the NYSE changed from “SLD” to “RC” for shares of our common stock. 
     On November 7, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) with Owens Realty Mortgage, Inc. (“ORM”), a specialty finance company that focuses on the origination, investment, and management of commercial real estate loans, primarily in the Western U.S. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will acquire ORM in a stock-for-stock transaction, whereby each outstanding share of ORM common stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.441 shares of Company common stock, based on a fixed exchange ratio. The estimated total consideration transferred of $182.6 million represents the current value of the Company’s common stock, adjusted for the exchange ratio, based on a November 7, 2018 closing price. Upon the closing of the transaction, which is conditioned on shareholder approval, Ready Capital stockholders will own approximately 72.4% of the combined company’s stock, while Owens Realty Mortgage stockholders will own approximately 27.6% of the combined company’s stock. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2019 and is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The stockholder base resulting from the acquisition of ORM is expected to enhance the trading volume and liquidity for our stockholders and support a greater level of institutional investor interest in our businesses.

 Our Manager
     We are externally managed and advised by Waterfall, an SEC registered investment adviser. Formed in 2005, Waterfall specializes in acquiring, managing, servicing and financing SBC and residential mortgage loans, as well as asset backed securities (“ABS”) and MBS. Waterfall has extensive experience in performing and non-performing loan acquisition, resolution and financing strategies. Waterfall’s investment committee is chaired by Thomas Capasse and Jack Ross, who serve as our Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively. Messrs. Capasse and Ross, who are co-founders of Waterfall, each have over 25 years of experience in managing and financing a range of financial assets, including having executed the first public securitization of SBC loans in 1993, through a variety of credit and interest rate environments. Messrs. Capasse and Ross have worked together in the same organization for more than 20 years. They are supported by a team of approximately 100 investment and other professionals with extensive experience in commercial mortgage credit underwriting, distressed asset acquisition and financing, SBC loan originations, commercial property valuation, capital deployment, financing strategies and legal and financial matters impacting our business. 
     We rely on Waterfall’s expertise in identifying loan acquisitions and origination opportunities. Waterfall uses the data and analytics developed through its experience as an owner of SBC loans and in implementing loss mitigation actions to support its origination activities and to develop its loan underwriting standards. Waterfall makes decisions based on a variety of factors, including expected risk-adjusted returns, credit fundamentals, liquidity, availability of financing, borrowing costs and macroeconomic conditions, as well as maintaining our REIT qualification and our exclusion from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act. 
     Our Investment Strategy and Market Opportunities Across Our Operating Segments
     Our investment strategy is to opportunistically expand our market presence in our acquisition and origination segments and further grow our SBC securitization capabilities which serve as a source of attractively priced, match-term financing.  Following the 2013 private placement transaction, we capitalized on the dislocation of the credit markets and depressed levels of available capital by acquiring SBC loans from distressed sellers at historically high risk-adjusted returns.  Alongside the growth in our acquired loan portfolio and using our experience in underwriting and managing such loans, we built out our SBC and SBA origination capabilities and most recently added a residential agency mortgage origination component.  As such, we have become a full-service real estate finance platform and we believe that the breadth of our business allows us to adapt to market conditions and deploy capital in our asset classes with the most attractive risk-adjusted returns.
     Our acquisition strategy complements our origination strategy by increasing our market intelligence in potential origination geographies, providing additional data to support our underwriting criteria and offering securitization market insight for various product offerings. The proprietary database on the causes of borrower default, loss severity, and market information that we developed from our SBC loan acquisition experience has served as the basis for the development of our SBC and SBA loan origination programs. Additionally, our origination strategy complements our acquisition strategy by providing additional captive refinancing options for our borrowers and further data to support our investment analysis while increasing our market presence with potential sellers of SBC assets.
     The following table illustrates certain information with respect to our four business segments as of December 31, 2018.

     According to the Federal Reserve, the U.S. commercial mortgage market including multi-family residences, and nonfarm, nonresidential mortgages totaled approximately $4.2 trillion as of December 2018.  The commercial mortgage market is largely bifurcated by loan size between “large balance” loans and “small balance” loans.  Large balance commercial loans typically include those loans with original principal balances of at least $20 million and are primarily financed by insurance companies and commercial mortgage backed securities (“CMBS”) conduits.  SBC loans typically include those loans with original principal amounts of between $500,000 and $35 million and are primarily financed by community and regional banks, specialty finance companies and loans guaranteed under the SBA loan programs.
     SBC loans are used by small businesses to purchase real estate used in their operations or by investors seeking to acquire small multi-family, office, retail, mixed use or warehouse properties. SBC loans represent a special category of commercial mortgage loans, sharing both commercial and residential mortgage loan characteristics. SBC loans are typically secured by first mortgages on commercial properties or other business assets, but because SBC loans are also often accompanied by personal guarantees, aspects of residential mortgage credit analysis are utilized in the underwriting process. Most SBC loans are fully amortizing on a schedule of up to 30 years.
 The table presented below illustrates a summary of how our Manager categorizes SBC loans compared to other real estate loan asset classes.

Asset Class | Average Initial Principal Balance | Loan-to-value | Yield 
Residential housing | ~ $225,000 | ~ 80% | ~ 4.0%
Large balance commercial loans | >= $20.0 million | ~ 65% | ~ 4.0%
Small balance commercial loans | ~ $2.0 million | ~ 60% | ~ 7.0%

      We rely on our Manager’s expertise in identifying SBC loans for us to acquire. Our Manager will make decisions based on a variety of factors, including expected risk-adjusted returns, credit fundamentals, liquidity, availability of financing, borrowing costs and macroeconomic conditions, as well as maintaining our REIT qualification and our exclusion from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Our investment decisions will depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different economic and capital market environments. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage of its equity that will be invested in any particular asset or strategy at any given time.

             Our SBC Loan Acquisition Platform
     Our SBC loan acquisition segment represents our investments in acquired SBC loans. We hold performing SBC loans to term, and we seek to maximize the value of the non-performing SBC loans acquired by us through proprietary loan modification programs. Where this is not possible, such as in the case of many non-performing loans, we seek to effect property resolution through the use of resolution alternatives to foreclosure.
     Our Manager specializes in acquiring SBC loans that are sold by banks, including as part of bank recapitalizations or mergers, and from other financial institutions such as thrifts and non-bank lenders. Other sources of SBC loans include special servicers of large balance SBC ABS and CMBS trusts, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as receiver for failed banks, servicers of non-performing SBA Section 7(a) Program loans, and Community Development Companies originating loans under the SBA 504 program, GSEs, and state economic development authorities. Over the last several years, our Manager has developed relationships with many of these entities, primarily banks and their advisors. In many cases, we are able to acquire SBC loans through negotiated transactions, at times partnering with acquiring banks or private equity firms in bank acquisitions and recapitalizations. We believe that our Manager’s experience, reputation and ability to underwrite SBC loans make it an attractive buyer for this asset class, and that its network of relationships will continue to produce opportunities for it to acquire SBC loans on attractive terms.
     Competition for SBC loan asset acquisitions has been limited due to the special servicing expertise required to manage SBC loan assets due to the small size of each loan, the uniqueness of the real properties that collateralize the loans, licensing requirements, the high volume of loans needed to build portfolios, and the need to utilize residential mortgage credit analysis in the underwriting process. These factors have limited institutional investor participation in SBC loan acquisitions, which has allowed us to acquire SBC loans with attractive risk-adjusted return profiles.

              Our Loan Origination Platforms 
      We originate SBC loans generally ranging in initial principal amount of between $500,000 and $35 million, and typically with a duration of six years at origination. Our origination platform, which focuses on first mortgage loans, provides conventional SBC mortgage financing for SBC properties nationwide through the following programs:
· | First mortgage loans. Loans for the acquisition or refinancing of stabilized properties secured by traditional commercial properties such as multi-family, office, retail, mixed use or warehouse properties, which are often guaranteed by the property owners. The loans are typically amortizing and have maturities of five to twenty years.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transitional loans. Loans for the acquisition of properties requiring more substantial expenditures for stabilization, secured by traditional commercial properties such as multi-family, office, retail, mixed use or warehouse properties which may be guaranteed by the property owners. The loans are typically interest-only and have maturities of two to four years.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Freddie Mac loans. Origination of loans ranging from $1 million to $5 million secured by multi-family properties through the recently launched Freddie Mac program. Loans are 90% guaranteed through the program. We sell qualifying loans to Freddie Mac, which, in turn, sells such loans to securitization structures. We are obligated to purchase the B-pieces secured by its underlying loans.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | SBA loans. Loans secured by real estate, machinery, equipment and inventory that are guaranteed, typically 75% under the SBA Section 7(a) Programs. SBA loans include personal guarantees of the borrower and are typically amortizing and have maturities of seven to twenty-five years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Additionally, as a large regional mortgage lender, we are approved to originate and service Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae eligible loans through the residential mortgage loan programs. These include prime, subprime and alternative-A and alternative-B mortgage loans, which may be adjustable-rate, hybrid and/or fixed-rate residential mortgage loans and pay option adjustable rate mortgage loans (“ARMs”). 
     Our origination platforms include the following segments: (i) SBC Originations (ii) SBA Originations and (iii) Residential Mortgage Originations.

     Through December 31, 2018, we have originated more than $3.5 billion in SBC loans in 38 states since ReadyCap Commercial’s inception in September 2012. The following chart summarizes our SBC conventional loan originations since ReadyCap Commercial’s formation: 

 As of December 31, 2018, our originated SBC loans held in our portfolio had a UPB of $1,479.3 million and a carrying value of approximately $1,488.1 million. Our originated SBC loans, substantially all of which are currently classified as performing loans, represented approximately 57.2% of the UPB and 58.6% of the carrying value of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018.

     Additionally, ReadyCap Commercial has been approved by Freddie Mac as one of 11 originators and servicers for multi-family loan products under the Freddie Mac program. As of December 31, 2018, ReadyCap Commercial employs 80 people focused on originating and supporting the SBC loan origination business.
     The SBC loan origination market is highly fragmented, with few dedicated lenders. Furthermore, we believe that as economic conditions continue to stabilize or strengthen, the volume of short-term loan extensions and restructurings of existing SBC loans will be reduced, resulting in increased opportunities for us to originate new SBC loans. 
     We believe that we have significant opportunity to originate SBC loans at attractive risk-adjusted returns. We believe that many banks have restrictive credit guidelines for our target assets. In addition, large banks are not focused on the SBC market and smaller banks only lend in specific geographies. We see an opportunity to earn an attractive risk spread premium by lending to borrowers that do not fit the credit guidelines of many banks. We believe that increased demand, coupled with the fragmentation of the SBC lending market, provides us with attractive opportunities to originate loans to borrowers with strong credit profiles and real estate collateral that supports ultimate repayment of the loans. 
     We expect to continue to source SBC loan originations through the following loan origination channels: 
    
· | Direct and indirect lending relationships. We will generate origination loan leads directly through our extensive relationships with commercial real estate brokers, bank loan officers and mortgage brokers that refer leads to our loan officers. To a lesser extent, we will also source loan leads through commercial real estate realtors, trusted advisors such as financial planners, lawyers, and certified public accountants (“CPAs”) and through direct-to-the-borrower transactions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other direct origination sources for SBC loans. From time to time, we may enter into strategic alliances and other referral programs with servicers, sub-servicers, strategic partners and vendors targeted at the refinancing of SBC loans.

      SBA Origination, Acquisition and Servicing Platform
     We operate our SBA loan origination, acquisition, and servicing segment through ReadyCap Lending. We acquire, originate and service owner-occupied loans guaranteed by the SBA under the SBA Section 7(a) Program through  ReadyCap Lending’s license, one of only 14 licensed non-bank SBLCs. In the future, we may also originate SBC loans for real estate under the SBA 504 loan program, pursuant to which the SBA guarantees subordinated, long-term financing. We believe investor demand for pass-through securities backed by the guaranteed portions of SBA Section 7(a) Program loans has been strong because the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. For this reason, we believe that SBA participating lenders that have sold the guaranteed portions of SBA Section 7(a) Program loans in recent years have been able to recognize attractive gains.
     The SBA was created out of the Small Business Act in 1953. The SBA’s function is to protect the interests of small businesses. The SBA classifies a small business as a business that is organized for profit and is independently owned and operating primarily within the United States with less than $15 million in tangible net worth and not more than $5 million in average after-tax net income. The SBA supports small businesses by administering several programs that provide loan guarantees against default on qualified loans made to eligible small businesses.
     The SBA Section 7(a) Program is the SBA’s primary program for providing financing for start-up and existing small businesses. The SBA typically guarantees 75% of qualified loans over $150,000. While the eligibility requirements of the SBA Section 7(a) Program vary depending on the industry of the borrower and other factors, the general eligibility requirements include the following: (i) gross sales of the borrower cannot exceed size standards set by the SBA (e.g., $30.0 million for limited service hospitality properties) or, alternatively, average net income cannot exceed $5.0 million for the most recent two fiscal years, (ii) liquid assets of the borrower and affiliates cannot exceed specified limits, (iii) tangible net worth of the borrower must be less than $15.0 million, (iv) the borrower must be a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident and (v) the maximum aggregate SBA loan guarantees to a borrower cannot exceed $3.75 million. The table below provides information on the SBA Section 7(a) Program’s key features, including its eligible uses, maximum loan amount, loan maturity, interest rate, guarantee fee, yearly fee and personal guarantee.

Use of Proceeds | Fixed assets, working capital, financing of start-up or to purchase an existing business. Some debt payment allowed but lender’s loan exposure may not be reduced with the proceeds. 
--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maximum Loan Amount | $5,000,000 
Maturity | Five to seven years for working capital and up to 25 years for equipment and real estate. All other loan purposes have a maximum term of ten years. 
Interest Rate | Negotiated between applicant and lender and is subject to maximums. The current maximums are Prime Rate plus 2.25% for maturities fewer than seven years and Prime Rate plus 2.75% for maturities of seven years or longer. Spreads on loans with an initial UPB below $50,000 have higher maximums. 
Guaranty Fee | Based on the loan’s maturity and the dollar amount guaranteed. The lender initially pays the guaranty fee and has the option to pass the expense on to the borrower at closing. A fee of 0.25% of the guaranteed portion of the loan is charged for loans with maturities of 12 months or less. For loans with maturities over 12 months, the fees are 2% for loans of $150,000 or less; 3% for loans of $150,001 to $700,000; 3.5% for loans over $700,000; and 3.75% for guaranteed portion over $1 million.
Yearly Fee | The ongoing yearly fee due from lenders to SBA is 0.52% of the guaranteed portion of the outstanding balance on the 7(a) loan. 
Personal Guarantee | Required from all owners of 20% or more of the equity of the business. Lenders can require personal guarantees of owners with less than 20% ownership.

          Residential Mortgage Origination Platform
 GMFS currently originates loans that are eligible to be purchased, guaranteed or insured by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, VA and USDA through retail, correspondent and broker channels. GMFS is licensed in 18 states and provides a wide range of residential mortgage services, including home purchase financing, mortgage refinancing, reverse mortgages, new construction loans and condo financing. GMFS operates through 13 retail branches located in Louisiana, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas. GMFS employs both a servicing retained and servicing released execution strategy, while retaining approximately 85-90% of current production. Our residential mortgage loan portfolio represented approximately 2.7% of the carrying value and 2.6% of the UPB of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018. Our residential mortgage origination platform employed a total of 235 people as of December 31, 2018.

 GMFS provides a residential origination platform to our sourcing capabilities, allowing access to new credit investment opportunities while controlling the origination process.  We believe we can enhance and grow the GMFS origination platform through better access to capital and an expanded product offering. In addition, using this platform we intend to continue to invest in MSRs through retention and secondary market transactions and to selectively pursue new residential product offerings.
 Highlights of the historical GMFS origination activity by purpose for the year ended December 31, 2018 are as follows: 

         The following table sets forth certain historical information related to the GMFS servicing of residential mortgage loans:

 Highlights of the GMFS operating activity (which is included in our residential mortgage banking segment) for the year ended December 31, 2018 are as follows: 
    
         Our management team has extensive experience and an established track record of operating through multiple market cycles.  We primarily originate, sell and service conventional, conforming agency and government insured residential mortgage loans originated or acquired through our three channels: retail, correspondent and wholesale. Our mortgage lending operation generates origination and processing fees, net of origination costs, at the time of origination as well as gains or unexpected losses when the loans are sold to third party investors, including the GSEs and Ginnie Mae. We retain servicing rights from the mortgage originations and earn servicing fees, net of sub-servicer costs, from our mortgage servicing portfolio. 
     We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand our footprint within the mortgage banking industry through:
    
· | Enhancement of our technology systems to drive further efficiency and customer satisfaction.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increased penetration of existing clients and through the addition of new branches and independent originators in our correspondent and wholesale channels.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Opportunistic geographic expansion in our retail channel.
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | Expansion of our Texas operation (launched in the Fall of 2015), which originates loans through our retail, correspondent, and wholesale channels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our Loan Pipeline        We have a large and active pipeline of potential acquisition and origination opportunities that are in various stages of our investment process. We refer to assets as being part of our acquisition pipeline or our origination pipeline if: 
    
· | an asset or portfolio opportunity has been presented to us and we have determined, after a preliminary analysis, that the assets fit within our investment strategy and exhibit the appropriate risk/reward characteristics and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in the case of acquired loans, we have executed a non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”) or an exclusivity agreement and commenced the due diligence process or we have executed more definitive documentation, such as a letter of intent (“LOI”), and in the case of originated loans, we have issued an LOI, and the borrower has paid a deposit.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      As of December 31, 2018, our Manager has identified approximately $1,004.2 million in potential assets as measured by the fully committed amounts of the loans, comprised of: 
    
· | $230.0 million in potential acquisitions of SBC loans,
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  17

 

    
· | $482.5 million in SBC loan originations,
--+-----------------------------------------


· | $167.7 million in SBA loan originations, and
--+---------------------------------------------


· | $124.0 million in commitments to originate residential agency loans.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

      We operate in a competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to originate or acquire the potential investments in the pipeline. The consummation of any of the potential loans in the pipeline depends upon, among other things, one or more of the following: available capital and liquidity, our Manager’s allocation policy, satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation and investment process, approval of our Manager’s Investment Committee, market conditions, our agreement with the seller on the terms and structure of such potential loan, and the execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation. Historically, we have acquired less than a majority of the assets in our Manager’s pipeline at any one time and there can be no assurance the assets currently in its pipeline will be acquired or originated by our Manager in the future.
         FINANCING STRATEGY
     We use prudent leverage to increase potential returns to our stockholders. We finance the loans we originate primarily through securitization transactions, as well through other borrowings. We also plan to sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA loan originations in the secondary market. 
     Our Manager’s extensive experience in non-performing and performing loan acquisition, origination, servicing and securitization strategies has enabled us to complete several securitizations of SBC loan and SBA 7(a) loan assets since January 2011. SBC securitization structures are non-recourse and typically provide debt equal to 50% to 90% of the cost basis of the SBC assets. Non-performing SBC ABS involve liquidating trusts with liquidation proceeds used to repay senior debt. Performing SBC ABS involve longer-duration trusts with principal and interest collections allocated to senior debt and losses on liquidated loans to equity and subordinate tranches. Our strategy is to continue to finance our assets through the securitization market, which will allow us to continue to match fund the SBC loans pledged as collateral to secure these securitizations on a long-term non-recourse basis. 
     We anticipate using other borrowings as part of our financing strategy, including re-securitizations, repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), and public and private equity and debt issuances.
     As of December 31, 2018, our committed and outstanding financing arrangements included: 
    
· | Seven committed credit facilities and three master repurchase agreements to finance our SBC and residential mortgage loans with $729.7 million of borrowings outstanding;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | $905.3 million of securitized debt obligations outstanding from $3.4 billion ABS that financed our whole loan acquisitions and SBC originations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | master repurchase agreements with four counterparties to fund our acquisition of MBS, short term investments, and SBC loans with $635.2 million of borrowings outstanding;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | $50.0 million in principal amount of 6.50% senior notes due 2021, our “Corporate Debt,” to originate or acquire our target assets and for general corporate purposes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | $180.0 million in principal amount of 7.50% senior secured notes due 2022, or “Senior Secured Notes,” to originate or acquire our target assets and for general corporate purposes; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | $115.0 million in principal amount of 7.00% convertible senior notes due 2023, our “Convertible Notes (and together with our Corporate Debt and Senior Secured Notes, the “Notes”), to originate or acquire our target assets and for general corporate purposes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our financing agreements require the company to maintain a debt-to-equity leverage ratio at certain levels. The amount of leverage we may employ for particular assets will depend upon the availability of particular types of financing and our Manager's assessment of the credit, liquidity, price volatility and other risks of those assets and financing counterparties. We currently target a total debt-to-equity leverage ratio between 3:1 to 4:1 and a recourse debt-to-equity leverage ratio between 1.5:1 to 2.5:1. We believe that these target leverage ratios are conservative for these asset classes and exemplify the conservative levels of borrowings we intend to use over time. We intend to use leverage for the primary purpose of financing our portfolio and not for the purpose of speculating on changes in interest rates. We may, however, be limited or restricted in the amount of leverage we may employ by the terms and provisions of any financing or other agreements that we may enter into in the future, and we may be subject to margin calls as a result of its financing activity. At December 31, 2018, we had a leverage ratio of 2.1x on a recourse debt-to-equity ratio.
     HEDGING STRATEGY
     Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we may use derivative financial instruments (or hedging instruments), including interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements, options on interest rate swaps, or swaptions, financial futures, structured credit indices, and options in an effort to hedge the interest rate and credit spread risk associated with the financing of our portfolio. Specifically, we attempt to hedge our exposure to potential interest rate mismatches between the interest we earn on our assets and our borrowing costs caused by fluctuations in short-term interest rates, and we intend to hedge our SBC loan originations from the date the interest rate is locked until the loan is included in a securitization. We also use hedging instruments in connection with our residential mortgage loan origination platform in an attempt to offset some of the impact of prepayments on our loans. In particular, we use MBS forward sales contracts to manage the interest rate price risk associated with the interest rate lock commitments we make with potential borrowers.  In utilizing leverage and interest rate hedges, our objectives include, where desirable, locking in, on a long-term basis, a spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our financing in an effort to improve returns to our stockholders. We will undertake to hedge our originated loan inventory pending securitization with respect to changes in securitization liability cost resulting from both changes in benchmark treasuries and credit spreads. Hedges are periodically re-balanced to match expected duration of the securitization and are closed at securitization issuance with the resulting gain or loss allocated to the retained basis in the securitization with the objective of protecting the yield for the aforementioned changes in securitization liabilities.     CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
     We strive to maintain an ethical workplace in which the highest standards of professional conduct are practiced.
    
· | Our board of directors is composed of a majority of independent directors. The Audit, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees of our board of directors are composed exclusively of independent directors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In order to foster the highest standards of ethics and conduct in all business relationships, we have adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics policy, which covers a wide range of business practices and procedures, that applies to our officers, directors, employees, if any, and independent contractors, to our Manager and our Manager’s officers and employees, and to any of our affiliates or affiliates of the Manager, and such affiliates’ officers and employees, who provide services to us or the Manager in respect of our Company. In addition, we have implemented Whistleblowing Procedures for Accounting and Auditing Matters and Code of Conduct and Ethics Violations (the “Whistleblower Policy”) that set forth procedures by which any Covered Persons (as defined in the Whistleblower Policy) may raise, on a confidential basis, concerns regarding, among other things, any questionable or unethical accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and any potential violations of the Code of Conduct and Ethics with our Audit Committee or the Chief Compliance Officer.

· | We have adopted an Insider Trading Policy for Trading in the Securities of our Company (the “Insider Trading Policy”), that governs the purchase or sale of our securities by any of our directors, officers, and associates (as defined in the Insider Trading Policy), if any, and independent contractors, as well as officers and employees of the Manager and our officers, employees and affiliates, and that prohibits any such persons from buying or selling our securities on the basis of material non-public information.

 COMPETITION
     We compete with numerous regional and community banks, specialty-finance companies, savings and loan associations and other entities, and we expect that others may be organized in the future. The effect of the existence of additional REITs and other institutions may be increased competition for the available supply of SBC and SBA assets suitable for purchase, which may cause the price for such assets to rise. Additionally, origination of SBC loans, SBA loans and residential agency loans by our competitors may increase the availability of these loans, which may result in a reduction of interest rates on these loans. 
     In the face of this competition, we expect to have access to our Manager’s professionals and their industry expertise, which may provide us with a competitive advantage in sourcing transactions and help it assess acquisition and origination risks and determine appropriate pricing for potential assets. Additionally, we believe that we are currently one of only a handful of active market participants in the secondary SBC loan market. Due to the special servicing expertise needed to effectively manage these assets, the small size of each loan, the uniqueness of the real properties that collateralize the loans and the need to bring residential mortgage credit analysis into the underwriting process, we expect a competitive demand for these assets to remain constrained. We seek to manage credit risk through our loan-level pre-origination or pre-acquisition due diligence and underwriting processes, which as of December 31, 2018 has limited the amount of realized losses. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face. For additional information concerning these competitive risks, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – New entrants in the market for SBC loan acquisitions and originations could adversely impact our ability to acquire SBC loans at attractive prices and originate SBC loans at attractive risk-adjusted returns.”
