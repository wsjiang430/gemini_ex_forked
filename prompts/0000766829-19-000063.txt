Item 1. | Business

General Development of Business
SJW Group was initially incorporated as SJW Corp. in the state of California on February 8, 1985. SJW Group is a holding company with four wholly-owned subsidiaries:

• | San Jose Water Company with its headquarters located at 110 West Taylor Street in San Jose, California 95110, was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1866. As part of a reorganization on February 8, 1985, San Jose Water Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Group. San Jose Water Company is a public utility in the business of providing water service to approximately 231,000 connections that serve a population of approximately one million people in an area comprising approximately 139 square miles in the metropolitan San Jose, California area. 


• | SJWTX, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Texas in 2005. SJWTX, Inc. is doing business as Canyon Lake Water Service Company (“CLWSC”). CLWSC is a public utility in the business of providing water service to approximately 16,000 connections that serve approximately 49,000 people. CLWSC’s service area comprises more than 246 square miles in the southern region of the Texas Hill Country in Blanco, Comal, Hays and Travis counties, the growing region between San Antonio and Austin, Texas. SJWTX, Inc. has a 25% interest in Acequia Water Supply Corporation (“Acequia”). The water supply corporation has been determined to be a variable interest entity within the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810, “Consolidation” with SJWTX, Inc. as the primary beneficiary. As a result, Acequia has been consolidated with SJWTX, Inc. 


• | SJW Land Company was incorporated in 1985. SJW Land Company owns undeveloped land and operates commercial buildings in Tennessee. SJW Land also has a 70% limited partnership interest in 444 West Santa Clara Street, L.P. The partnership owned a commercial building in California which was sold by the partnership on April 6, 2017. See Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of the sales transaction. 


• | Hydro Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SJW Group, is a Connecticut corporation that was formed on March 9, 2018, for the sole purpose of effecting the proposed merger of SJW Group and Connecticut Water Service, Inc. (“CTWS”). See below for discussion of the SJW Group and CTWS Merger Agreement.

Texas Water Alliance Limited (“TWA”), was previously a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Group undertaking activities to develop a water supply project in Texas. On November 16, 2017, SJW Group sold all of its equity interest in TWA to Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority (“GBRA”) for $31.0 million. See Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the sales transaction.
Together, San Jose Water Company, CLWSC and TWA, up to the date of sale in 2017, are referred to as “Water Utility Services.”

SJW Land Company and its consolidated variable interest entity, 444 West Santa Clara Street, L.P. which operated a commercial building rental, are collectively referred to as “Real Estate Services.”
SJW Group and CTWS Merger (the “Merger”)
On March 14, 2018, SJW Group, Hydro Sub, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with CTWS to effect a merger with CTWS in an all-stock transaction. On August 5, 2018, SJW Group, Hydro Sub, Inc. and CTWS entered into a Second Amended and Restated Agreement & Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), which provided, among other things, that SJW Group will acquire CTWS in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each issued and then outstanding share of common stock of CTWS will be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $70.00 per share. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of both companies and on November 16, 2018 by CTWS shareholders and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and approval by certain regulators. Under certain circumstances, SJW Group will be obligated to pay a termination fee of $42.5 million to CTWS if the Merger Agreement is terminated by SJW Group, including without limitation in the event that SJW Group materially breaches its non-solicitation obligations or SJW Group enters into an alternative acquisition agreement, in each case subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, as amended. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, SJW Group may be required to reimburse CTWS up to $5 million of certain fees and expenses (any termination fee payable by SJW Group under the Merger Agreement would be reduced by such amount) if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances. Recent updates related to the proposed merger include the following:

• | On December 3, 2018, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (“PURA”) issued a proposed final decision denying the application by SJW Group and CTWS for approval of the proposed merger (“Proposed Final Decision”). On December 5, 2018, PURA conditionally granted SJW Group’s and CTWS’s motion to suspend the schedule permitting SJW Group and CTWS to file new evidence that was unavailable before the close of the record in the proceeding for PURA’s consideration. On December 14, 2018, SJW Group and CTWS filed a motion to reopen the record and extend the procedural schedule to admit new evidence that was submitted concurrent with the motion (“Motion to Reopen”). On January 4, 2019, PURA denied the Motion to Reopen concluding that the concessions and offers of commitments did not constitute new evidence and to the extent that some of the filed material contains “new” evidence, the material was insufficient to warrant reopening. On January 9, 2019, SJW Group and CTWS withdrew their application before PURA and issued a joint press release announcing that they are continuing to evaluate their regulatory approach in connection with the proposed merger, including the possibility of submitting a new application to PURA. PURA closed the docket without issuing a final decision on January 11, 2019. After a thorough review conducted by the management and boards of both companies with the support of their respective local Connecticut regulatory counsel SJW Group and CTWS announced on February 20, 2019 that they intend to file a new merger approval application with PURA. The new application is expected to be filed during the second quarter of 2019. 


• | On December 20, 2018, the Maine Public Utilities Commission (“MPUC”) staff issued a stay in the reorganization proceeding pending resolution of the regulatory filing with PURA. On January 10, 2019, following the withdrawal of the PURA application, the Maine Water Company notified the MPUC of such withdrawal in a status report. On January 23, 2019, the Maine Water Company filed notice of its intent to voluntarily withdraw its application without prejudice, reserving the right to refile at a later date. Later that day, the MPUC acknowledged receipt of the Maine Water Company’s notice and issued notice closing the docket. After a thorough review conducted by the management and boards of both companies with the support of their respective local Maine regulatory counsel SJW Group and CTWS announced on February 20, 2019 that they intend to file a new merger approval application with MPUC. The new application is expected to be filed during the second quarter of 2019. 


• | While SJW Group believes that no prior authorization of the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) is required for the Merger, the CPUC previously issued an order to investigate the proposed merger, such as whether it is subject to CPUC approval and its likely impacts within California. The assigned commissioner’s Scoping Memo issued September 7, 2018 adopted a schedule providing for the CPUC to vote on a proposed decision in December 2018. However, as a result of unexpected delays in the CPUC’s scheduling of a planned public participation hearing, which was held January 31, 2019, the CPUC is now expected to complete its investigation in the second quarter of 2019. 

There is no guarantee that the proposed merger will be completed, and the failure to complete the proposed merger may adversely affect the financial conditions and results of operations of the company. For a description of certain risk factors relating to the proposed merger, please see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Regulation and Rates
California Regulatory Affairs
San Jose Water Company’s rates, service and other matters affecting its business are subject to regulation by the CPUC.
 4

Generally, there are three types of rate adjustments that affect San Jose Water Company’s revenue collection: general rate adjustments, cost of capital adjustments, and offset rate adjustments. General rate adjustments are authorized in general rate case decisions, which usually authorize an initial rate adjustment followed by two annual escalation adjustments. General rate applications are normally filed and processed during the last year covered by the most recent general rate case as required by the CPUC in order to avoid any gaps in regulatory decisions on general rate adjustments.
Cost of capital adjustments are rate adjustments resulting from the CPUC’s usual tri-annual establishment of a reasonable rate of return for San Jose Water Company’s capital investments.
The purpose of an offset rate adjustment is to compensate utilities for changes in specific pre-authorized offsettable capital investments or expenses, primarily for purchased water, groundwater extraction, purchased power and pensions. Pursuant to Section 792.5 of the California Public Utilities Code, a balancing account must be maintained for each expense item for which such revenue offsets have been authorized. Memorandum accounts track revenue impacts due to catastrophic events, certain unforeseen water quality expenses related to new federal and state water quality standards, energy efficiency, water conservation, water tariffs and other approved activities or as directed by the CPUC such as the memorandum account for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (the “Tax Act”). The purpose of balancing and memorandum accounts is to track the under-collection or over-collection associated with such expense changes.
On November 15, 2017, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 513/513A with the CPUC requesting a revenue increase of $15.7 million, or 4.22%, for the 2018 escalation year included in the 2015 General Rate Case. This request was approved and the new rates became effective on January 1, 2018.
On November 29, 2017, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 514 with the CPUC requesting to adjust the Utilities Reimbursement Account User Fees as directed by CPUC Resolution M-4832. The reimbursement fee was reduced from 1.44% to 1.4%. This request was approved and the new fee became effective on January 1, 2018.
San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 515 on December 28, 2017, with the CPUC requesting authorization to establish the 2018 Tax Accounting Memorandum Account. This memorandum account captured any changes to the revenue requirement resulting from the impact of the Tax Act signed into law December 22, 2017. This request became effective on January 1, 2018.
As required by the CPUC, on April 3, 2017, San Jose Water Company filed an application requesting authority to establish its authorized Cost of Capital for the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. On March 22, 2018, the CPUC approved a new cost of capital for San Jose Water Company in Decision 18-03-035 that lowered the rate of return from 8.09% to 7.64% thereby reducing the 2018 revenue requirement by $5.8 million or 1.57% effective January 1, 2018. On March 22, 2018, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 518 with the CPUC requesting authorization to adjust water rates to reflect the decision effective March 22, 2018.
On January 4, 2018, San Jose Water Company filed General Rate Case Application No. 18-01-004 (“GRC”) with the CPUC requesting authority for an increase of revenue of $34.3 million, or 9.76%, in 2019, $14.2 million, or 3.70%, in 2020 and $20.6 million, or 5.17%, in 2021. Among other things, the application also included requests to recover $20.7 million from balancing and memorandum accounts, the establishment of a Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism and Sales Reconciliation Mechanism (“WRAM/SRM”), and a shift to greater revenue collection in the service charge. On June 28, 2018, the CPUC issued an order in the case identifying the issues to be considered, including whether the proposed merger between SJW Group and CTWS will have any ratemaking impact on the customers of San Jose Water Company (see discussion on the proposed merger at Note 12 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” ). This consideration was subsequently removed from the GRC to be considered in an Order Instituting Investigation (“OII”) on the proposed merger issued on July 20, 2018, see below for further discussion. On August 10, 2018, San Jose Water Company and the Office of Ratepayer Advocates filed a joint motion for partial settlement (“Settlement”) of the GRC with the CPUC, resolving all issues in the GRC with the exception of authorization of a WRAM/SRM and the recovery of the balance in the Hydro Generation Research, Development and Demonstration Memorandum Account, such issues being subsequently contested in legal briefs. On October 16, 2018 the CPUC issued a Proposed Decision adopting the Settlement in part, without any impact on the proposed revenue requirement outlined in the Settlement, and delaying ruling on the contested issues in order to allow the Settlement rates to become effective January 1, 2019. On December 4, 2018, the CPUC issued Decision 18-11-025 authorizing new rates for 2019. Accordingly, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 528/528A on December 7, 2018 requesting authorization to increase the revenue requirement by $16.4 million or 4.55% in 2019. This was approved on December 28, 2018 and new rates became effective January 1, 2019.
On March 23, 2018, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 519 with the CPUC requesting authorization to update the Rule 15 income tax provisions as a result of the recent changes to the federal tax laws.  This advice letter has no impact on water rates and became effective January 1, 2018.

The CPUC directed its Class A water utilities, including San Jose Water Company, to reflect the changes to the Internal Revenue Code resulting from the passage of the Tax Act in customer rates. On May 8, 2018, the CPUC directed San Jose Water Company to file an advice letter to implement a change in water rates to reflect the lower income tax rate provided by the Tax Act, effective July 1, 2018. On May 23, 2018, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 522 in compliance with the CPUC’s directive. On June 7, 2018, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 522A amending the rate change to reflect a reduction in revenue requirement for 2018 of $14.8 million or 3.89%, with no impact on after tax income. This request became effective July 1, 2018.
On June 13, 2018, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 523 with the CPUC requesting authorization to implement surcharges to offset the increases to purchased potable water charges, the ground water extraction fee, and purchased recycled water charges implemented by the Santa Clara Valley Water District (“SCVWD”) and South Bay Water Recycling effective July 1, 2018. This surcharge will result in a revenue increase of $13.7 million or 3.75%. This request became effective July 1, 2018.
San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 524 with the CPUC on July 26, 2018, requesting authorization to recover the 2017 capital additions related to the Montevina Water Treatment Plant Upgrade Project. The filing requested a revenue increase of $3.2 million or 0.83% and became effective August 25, 2018.
On July 20, 2018 the CPUC issued OII No. 18-07-007 concerning SJW Group’s merger with CTWS. In its filing, the CPUC committed to a schedule that would complete its investigation in a time frame to allow the proposed merger to move forward by the end of 2018, if appropriate. At a required pre-hearing Conference on August 22, 2018, the CPUC confirmed its commitment to the schedule and a Scoping Memorandum was subsequently issued on September 7, 2018, which identified issues to be considered on whether the proposed merger is subject to CPUC approval and its likely impacts within California. On September 14, 2018, SJW Group and San Jose Water Company submitted joint comments in response to the issues identified above in accordance with the Scoping Memorandum’s adopted schedule, and reply comments were submitted on October 19, 2018. A Public Participation Hearing was held on January 31, 2019, with a CPUC decision now expected in the second quarter of 2019.
In January 2017, a San Jose Water Company customer inquired about the company’s billing practice as it related to the proration of service charges in billing cycles where a rate change occurred. After reviewing its existing practice as well as those of other Class A water utilities, San Jose Water Company determined that it was appropriate to modify its existing practice to prorate service charges similar to the manner in which it prorates quantity charges - that is by applying both the old and new rates to the portion of the billing cycle for which the rates were in effect. This change was implemented on January 30, 2017, and retroactively applied to January 1, 2017. Subsequently, on May 8, 2017, the CPUC’s Water Division notified San Jose Water Company that it had violated Public Utilities Code 532 and other CPUC Orders and directed the company to file an advice letter providing refunds for the period of January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2016. As directed, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter 510 on June 6, 2017, to propose customer refunds in the amount of $1.8 million for the same period. On June 22, 2017, San Jose Water Company was served with Complaint 17-06-009 regarding its billing practice for service charge rate changes. On August 11, 2017, the Water Division rejected Advice Letter 510 in light of the CPUC’s investigation into San Jose Water Company’s past and present billing practice. The billing issue was made a part of San Jose Water Company’s 2019 GRC proceeding. Testimony was provided by the Office of Ratepayer Advocates (now the Public Advocates Office or “Cal PA”) on May 23, 2018. On June 8, 2018, the company provided its rebuttal testimony. On August 10, 2018, San Jose Water Company and Cal PA submitted a partial settlement agreement on issues presented in the GRC. Both the company and Cal PA settled on the billing issue limiting the duration from which to calculate customer refunds from June 1, 2011 through December 31, 2016. Accordingly, San Jose Water Company has provided an additional reserve to cover the remaining period covered by the settlement. In accordance with Decision 18-11-025 for the GRC, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 530 proposing total refunds of $2.02 million for the period from June 1, 2011 through December 31, 2016. This advice letter became effective February 8, 2019.
On September 14, 2018, the CPUC issued OII No. 18-09-003 to which San Jose Water Company was named as Respondent. The OII will determine whether the company unlawfully overcharged customers over a 30-year period by failing to pro-rate service charges when increases occurred during a billing period, and whether the company double-billed service charges during one billing period when allegedly switching from billing such charges in advance to billing in arrears.  The OII resulted from a report by the CPUC’s Consumer Protection and Enforcement Division (“CPED”), dated August 16, 2018, recommending an investigation into San Jose Water Company’s billing practice.  CPED calculated a refund obligation of approximately $2.1 million for the years 2014 to 2016 that had been the subject of San Jose Water Company’s Advice Letter No. 510.  CPED calculated a further refund obligation of approximately $2 million for the years 1987 to 2013.  CPED also asserted that the company double-billed its customers during a billing period when it allegedly converted from billing in advance to billing in arrears, assumed that such double-billing occurred in January 2011, and calculated a refund obligation of approximately $4.9 million.  The OII notes these estimates and identifies the proper refund amount as an issue in the proceeding.  The OII also 
 6

identifies the CPUC’s authority to consider imposing penalties on San Jose Water Company in amounts ranging from $500 to $50,000 per offense, per day. San Jose Water Company continues to cooperate with the CPUC to resolve these issues. On October 15, 2018, San Jose Water Company filed a response to the OII with the CPUC, in which the company stated that it believes it would not be appropriate for the Commission to require refunds extending prior to June 2011, that no double billing has occurred and that no penalties should be imposed on the company. As a result, the company believes it is only probable that refunds agreed to in the partial settlement, $2.02 million, in the GRC will be refunded to customers and has provided for this amount in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. A prehearing conference on the matter was concluded on January 7, 2019, and a scoping memorandum outlining the remaining part of the proceeding scheduled was issued on February 11, 2019. The scoping memorandum outlined the following issues to be determined: (1) Did San Jose Water Company overbill its customers for water service during the period from January 1987 to June 2011, (2) If San Jose Water Company overbilled its customers during the above period, should the Commission fine San Jose Water Company or impose some other form of penalty on it, and (3) Is this action subject to any statute of limitations including, but not limited to, Section 736 of the Public Utilities Code? San Jose Water Company is unable to determine an estimate at this time, if any. The CPUC is expected to issue a final decision in the matter in September of 2019.
Texas Regulatory Affairs
CLWSC is subject to the economic regulation of the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (“PUCT”). The PUCT authorize rate increases after the filing of an Application for a Rate/Tariff Change. Rate cases may be filed as they become necessary, provided there is no current rate case outstanding. Further, rate cases may not be filed more frequently than once every 12 months.
As required, CLWSC submitted on July 31, 2018 its Water Pass-Through Charge (“WPC”) true-up report to the PUCT reflecting a change from $1.15 to $1.13 per thousand gallons. The WPC is the annual filing to change that component of CLWSC’s water rates for the changes in purchased water costs since the last annual true-up report. This change for 2018 became effective on water bills being prepared as of February 1, 2018.
The PUCT directed CLWSC (as well as other Class A water utilities in Texas) to quantify all of the impacts of the passage of the Tax Act and make rate adjustments reflecting such impacts on a prospective basis. PUCT Order 47945-36 as amended by 47945-41 directs the water utilities to record a regulatory liability that reflects (1) the difference between the revenues collected under existing rates and the revenues that would have been collected had the existing rates been set using the recently approved federal income tax rates; and (2) the balance of excess accumulated deferred federal income taxes that now exists because of the decrease in the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. A rate proposal reflecting these tax changes was submitted for PUCT’s review on April 19, 2018. CLWSC subsequently amended its filing on April 30, 2018 to update the customer notice, and to replace estimates with actual information. This filing will return to the ratepayers the difference between the revenues collected under the existing rates and what water rates would have been using the 21% federal income tax rate now effective under the Tax Act. The accrued amounts for the period January 25, 2018 through April 30, 2018 were refunded along with the regular monthly Federal Tax Cut Credit (“FTCC”) on bills prepared during the month of June. The FTCC customer credit will continue to be reflected on customer bills every month until the implementation of new rates resulting from the next rate case.
CLWSC’s Sale Transfer and Merger application (“STM”) to acquire the Deer Creek Ranch Water Co., LLC’s assets was filed with the PUCT on December 20, 2017. Notices to customers and surrounding water companies and municipalities were mailed in January 2018 and on April 3, 2018 and the PUCT filed 47888-12, Order No. 4, approving the transaction between CLWSC and the Deer Creek Ranch Water Co., LLC to proceed in closing. The acquisition subsequently closed on July 2, 2018. The required completed transaction report was filed with the PUCT on July 5, 2018, and the Joint Proposed Notice of Approval was filed with the PUCT on September 17, 2018. The final order transferring the Certificate of Convenience and Necessity, or the exclusive right to provide water utility service, from Deer Creek Ranch Water Co., LLC to CLWSC was issued on November 29, 2018.

Description of Business
General
The principal business of Water Utility Services consists of the production, purchase, storage, purification, distribution, wholesale, and retail sale of water. San Jose Water Company provides water services to approximately 231,000 connections that serve approximately one million people residing in portions of the cities of San Jose and Cupertino and in the cities of Campbell, Monte Sereno, Saratoga and the Town of Los Gatos, and adjacent unincorporated territories, all in the County of Santa Clara in the State of California. CLWSC provides water service to approximately 16,000 connections that serve approximately 49,000 people in a service area comprising more than 246 square miles in the growing region between San Antonio and Austin, Texas. San Jose Water Company and CLWSC distribute water to customers in accordance with accepted 
 7

water utility methods. SJW Land Company owns an undeveloped real estate property, commercial and warehouse properties in Tennessee and holds a 70% limited partnership interest in 444 West Santa Clara Street, L.P. 
San Jose Water Company also provides non-tariffed services under agreements with municipalities and other utilities. These non-tariffed services include water system operations, maintenance agreements and antenna site leases.
In October 1997, San Jose Water Company commenced operation of the City of Cupertino municipal water system under the terms of a 25-year lease. The system is adjacent to the San Jose Water Company service area and has approximately 4,600 service connections. Under the terms of the lease, San Jose Water Company paid an upfront $6.8 million concession fee to the City of Cupertino that is being amortized over the contract term. San Jose Water Company assumed responsibility for all maintenance and operating costs of the system, while receiving all payments for water service.
Among other things, operating results from the water business fluctuate according to the demand for water, which is often influenced by seasonal conditions, such as impact of drought, summer temperatures or the amount and timing of precipitation in Water Utility Services’ service areas. Revenue, production expenses and income are affected by changes in water sales and the availability of surface water supply. Overhead costs, such as payroll and benefits, depreciation, interest on long-term debt, and property taxes, remain fairly constant despite variations in the amount of water sold. As a result, earnings are highest in the higher demand, warm summer months and lowest in the lower demand, cool winter months.
Water Supply
San Jose Water Company’s water supply consists of groundwater from wells, surface water from watershed run-off and diversion, reclaimed water, and imported water purchased from the SCVWD under the terms of a master contract with SCVWD expiring in 2051. During non-drought years, purchased water provides approximately 40% to 50% of San Jose Water Company’s annual production. An additional 40% to 50% of its water supply is pumped from the underground basin which is subject to a groundwater extraction charge paid to SCVWD. Surface supply, which during a normal rainfall year satisfies about 6% to 8% of San Jose Water Company’s annual water supply needs, provides approximately 1% of its water supply in a dry year and approximately 14% in a wet year. In dry years, the decrease in water from surface run-off and diversion and the corresponding increase in purchased and pumped water, increases production expenses substantially.
The pumps and motors at San Jose Water Company’s groundwater production facilities are propelled by electric power. San Jose Water Company has installed standby power generators at 33 of its strategic water production sites and manages a fleet of 21 portable generators deployed throughout the distribution system for power outages at remaining pumping facilities. In addition, the commercial office and operations control centers are outfitted with standby power equipment that allow critical distribution and customer service operations to continue during a power outage. SCVWD has informed San Jose Water Company that its filter plants, which deliver purchased water to San Jose Water Company, are also equipped with standby generators. In the event of a power outage, San Jose Water Company believes it will be able to prevent an interruption of service to customers for a limited period by pumping water using generator power and by using purchased water from SCVWD.
In 2018, the level of water in the Santa Clara Valley groundwater basin, which is managed by the SCVWD, experienced a decrease due to: (1) an increase in groundwater pumping by various water retailers in the region, and (2) below normal local rainfall and natural recharge. As reported by the SCVWD at the end of 2018, the groundwater level in the Santa Clara Plain was 5 feet lower compared to the same time in 2017, and 19 feet higher than the five-year average. The total groundwater storage at the end of 2018 was within Stage 1 (Normal) of the SCVWD’s Water Shortage Contingency Plan. On January 1, 2019, SCVWD’s 10 reservoirs were 26% full with 43,133 acre-feet of water in storage. As of December 31, 2018, San Jose Water Company’s Lake Elsman was 24.8% full with 1,528 acre-feet of water, approximately 55.2% of the five-year seasonal average. In addition, the rainfall at San Jose Water Company’s Lake Elsman was measured at 9.35 inches for the period from July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, which is 68.6% of the five-year average. Local surface water is a less costly source of water than groundwater or purchased water and its availability significantly impacts San Jose Water Company’s results of operations. San Jose Water Company’s Montevina Water Treatment Plant retrofit project was completed in 2018 and resumed full operations of treating local surface water. San Jose Water Company believes that its various sources of water supply will be sufficient to meet customer demand in 2019.
From 2014 to 2016, California was in a severe drought. In response to the drought, the State Water Resources Control Board (the “State Water Board”) imposed mandatory water use restrictions and conservation targets. SCVWD, San Jose Water Company’s principal water supplier, also mandated water use restrictions along with conservation targets at levels higher than the State Water Board. While the Governor of California declared the drought over on April 7, 2017, the State Water Board made certain water use restrictions permanent while SCVWD maintained a conservation target at 20%.
On May 31, 2018, Governor Edmund G. Brown signed into law Assembly Bill 1668 and Senate Bill 606. Both bills set an initial limit for indoor water use of 55 gallons per person per day by 2022 and reduced the limit further to 50 gallons per person 
 8

per day by 2030.  Implementation details remain to be developed as to how local water providers will meet this mandate as well as to how the CPUC will direct its regulated utilities to comply.
California also faces long-term water supply challenges. San Jose Water Company actively works with SCVWD to meet the challenges by continuing to educate customers on responsible water use practices and conducting long-range water supply planning.

CLWSC’s water supply consists of groundwater from wells and purchased treated and raw water from the GBRA. CLWSC has long-term agreements with the GBRA, which expire in 2037, 2040, 2044 and 2050. The agreements, which are take-or-pay contracts, provide CLWSC with an aggregate of 6,900 acre-feet of water per year from Canyon Lake at prices that may be adjusted periodically by GBRA. In 2018, CLWSC acquired raw water supply agreements with the Lower Colorado River Authority (“LCRA”) and West Travis Public Utility Agency (“WTPUA”) expiring in 2053 and 2046, respectively, to provide for 250 acre-feet of water per year from Lake Austin and the Colorado River, respectively, at prices that may be adjusted periodically by the agencies.

Franchises
Franchises granted by local jurisdictions permit Water Utility Services to construct, maintain, and operate water distribution systems within the streets and other public properties of a given jurisdiction. San Jose Water Company holds the necessary franchises to provide water in portions of the cities of San Jose and Cupertino and in the cities of Campbell, Monte Sereno and Saratoga, the Town of Los Gatos and the unincorporated areas of Santa Clara County. None of the franchises have a termination date, other than the franchise for the unincorporated areas of Santa Clara County, which terminates in 2020. The renewal process is expected to begin in 2019.
CLWSC holds the franchises for water and wastewater services to the City of Bulverde and the City of Spring Branch, which terminate in 2029 and 2036, respectively. The unincorporated areas that CLWSC serves in Comal, Blanco, Hays, and Travis Counties do not require water service providers to obtain franchises.
Seasonal Factors
Water sales are seasonal in nature and influenced by weather conditions. The timing of precipitation and climatic conditions can cause seasonal water consumption by customers to vary significantly. Demand for water is generally lower during the cooler and rainy winter months. Demand increases in the spring when the temperature rises and rain diminishes.
Competition
San Jose Water Company and CLWSC are public utilities regulated by the CPUC and PUCT, respectively, and operate within a service area approved by the regulators. Statutory laws provide that no other investor-owned public utility may operate in the public utilities’ service areas without first obtaining from the regulator a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Past experience shows such a certificate will be issued only after demonstrating that service in such area is inadequate.
California law also provides that whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend utility service to the service area of a privately-owned public utility, like San Jose Water Company, such an act constitutes the taking of property and is conditioned upon payment of just compensation to the private utility.
Under the California law, municipalities, water districts and other public agencies have been authorized to engage in the ownership and operation of water systems. Such agencies are empowered to condemn properties operated by privately-owned public utilities upon payment of just compensation and are further authorized to issue bonds (including revenue bonds) for the purpose of acquiring or constructing water systems. To the company’s knowledge, no municipality, water district or other public agency has pending any proceeding to condemn any part of its water systems.
Environmental Matters
Water Utility Services’ produces potable water in accordance with all applicable county, state and federal environmental rules and regulations. Additionally, public utilities are subject to environmental regulation by various other state and local governmental authorities.

Water Utility Services is currently in compliance with all of the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (the “EPA”) surface water treatment performance standards, drinking water standards for disinfection by-products and primary maximum contaminant levels. These standards have been adopted and are enforced by the California State Water Board, Division of Drinking Water and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for San Jose Water Company and CLWSC, respectively.
Other state and local environmental regulations apply to our Water Utility Services’ operations and facilities. These regulations relate primarily to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and discharges to the environment. San Jose Water Company began performing hazardous materials site assessments and remediation prior to the construction phase of capital projects in 2006. The site assessments are performed to remove any legacy materials and to obtain site closures from the Santa Clara County Department of Environmental Health under its Voluntary Cleanup Program.
San Jose Water Company is a permittee under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit (“NPDES”) for drinking water system discharges to Waters of the United States (“WOTUS”). An unplanned non-compliant discharge under the NPDES permit took place on September 10, 2017. The event was reported to the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Control Board and San Jose Water Company was subsequently notified that an enforcement action would be pursued by the agency. This matter has been resolved by San Jose Water Company agreeing to pay a settlement amount which was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.
San Jose Water Company is currently in compliance with all state and local regulations governing hazardous materials, point and non-point source discharges and the warning provisions of the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986.
