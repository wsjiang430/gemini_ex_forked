ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Nelnet is a diverse company with a focus on delivering education-related products and services and loan asset management. The largest operating businesses engage in student loan servicing; education technology, services, and payment processing; and communications. A significant portion of the Company's revenue is net interest income earned on a portfolio of federally insured student loans. The Company also makes investments to further diversify both within and outside of its historical core education-related businesses, including, but not limited to, investments in real estate and early-stage and emerging growth companies. Substantially all revenue from external customers is earned, and all long-lived assets are located, in the United States.
The Company was formed as a Nebraska corporation in 1978 to service federal student loans for two local banks. The Company built on this initial foundation as a servicer to become a leading originator, holder, and servicer of federal student loans, principally consisting of loans originated under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. A detailed description of the FFEL Program is included in Appendix A to this report.
The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “Reconciliation Act of 2010”) discontinued new loan originations under the FFEL Program, effective July 1, 2010, and requires that all new federal student loan originations be made directly by the Department through the Federal Direct Loan Program. This law does not alter or affect the terms and conditions of existing FFELP loans.
As a result of the Reconciliation Act of 2010, the Company no longer originates new FFELP loans. However, a significant portion of the Company's income continues to be derived from its existing FFELP student loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a $22.4 billion loan portfolio, consisting primarily of FFELP loans, that management anticipates will amortize over the next approximately 20 years and has a weighted average remaining life of 8.7 years. Interest income on the Company's existing FFELP loan portfolio will decline over time as the portfolio is paid down. However, since July 1, 2010, which is the effective date on and after which no new loans can be originated under the FFEL Program, the Company has purchased $25.1 billion of FFELP loans from other FFELP loan holders looking to exit or adjust their FFELP businesses. The Company believes there may be additional opportunities to purchase FFELP portfolios to generate incremental earnings and cash flow. However, since all FFELP loans will eventually run off, a key objective of the Company is to reposition itself for the post-FFELP environment. 
To reduce its reliance on interest income on student loans, the Company has expanded its services and products. This expansion has been accomplished through internal growth and innovation as well as business acquisitions. In addition, in 2009, the Company began servicing federally owned student loans for the Department.

•Providing outsourced services including call center, processing, and marketing services
On February 7, 2018, the Company acquired Great Lakes. The operating results of Great Lakes are included in the Loan Servicing and Systems operating segment from the date of acquisition. Nelnet Servicing, LLC ("Nelnet Servicing"), a subsidiary of the Company, and Great Lakes are two of the four large private sector companies (referred to as Title IV Additional Servicers, or "TIVAS") that have student loan servicing contracts awarded by the Department in June 2009 to provide servicing for loans owned by the Department. As of the acquisition date, Great Lakes was servicing approximately $242 billion in government-owned student loans, approximately $11 billion in FFELP loans, and approximately $2 billion in private education loans. 
From the date of acquisition and going forward, Great Lakes and Nelnet Servicing have continued, and will continue, to service their respective government-owned portfolios on behalf of the Department, while maintaining their distinct brands, independent servicing operations, and teams. Likewise, each entity will continue to compete for new student loan volume under its respective existing contract with the Department. The Company has integrated, and will continue to integrate, technology as well as shared services and other activities to become more efficient and effective in meeting borrower needs. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company converted Great Lakes' FFELP and private education loan servicing volume to Nelnet Servicing's servicing platform to leverage the efficiencies of supporting more volume on fewer systems.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company serviced $464.6 billion of loans for 15.6 million borrowers. See Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the "MD&A") - "Loan Servicing and Systems Operating Segment - Results of Operations - Student Loan Servicing Volumes" for additional information related to the Company's servicing volume.
Servicing federally-owned student loans for the Department
As discussed above, Nelnet Servicing and Great Lakes are two of four large private sector companies, or TIVAS, awarded student loan servicing contracts by the Department to provide additional servicing capacity for loans owned by the Department. These loans include Federal Direct Loan Program loans originated directly by the Department and FFEL Program loans purchased by the Department. Under the servicing contracts, Nelnet Servicing and Great Lakes earn a monthly fee from the Department for each unique borrower who has loans owned by the Department and serviced by Nelnet Servicing or Great Lakes, respectively. The amount paid per each unique borrower is dependent on the status of the borrower (e.g., in school or in repayment). As of December 31, 2018, Nelnet Servicing was servicing $179.5 billion of student loans for 5.8 million borrowers under its contract, and Great Lakes was servicing $232.7 billion of student loans for 7.5 million borrowers under its contract. The Department is the Company's largest customer, representing 30 percent of the Company's revenue in 2018.
The servicing contracts with the Department are currently scheduled to expire on June 16, 2019. On February 20, 2018, the Department’s Office of Federal Student Aid ("FSA") released information regarding a contract procurement process entitled Next Generation Financial Services Environment (“NextGen”) for the servicing of all student loans owned by the Department. On August 24, August 27, and September 24, 2018, FSA made announcements that included canceling certain components of the NextGen process and issuing a solicitation for a separate new procurement process for certain of those NextGen components that were canceled.

On January 15, 2019, FSA released an amendment canceling all components of NextGen except the Enterprise-Wide Digital and Customer Care Platforms and Services component and issued new solicitations for three new NextGen components:
•NextGen Enhanced Processing Solution
•NextGen Business Process Operations
•NextGen Optimal Processing Solution 
On February 20, 2019, FSA awarded the Enterprise-Wide Digital and Customer Care Platforms and Services component to Accenture Federal Services. The Company is part of teams that currently intend to respond to the solicitations for each of the three ongoing NextGen components. The Company cannot predict the timing, nature, or outcome of these solicitations.
The Department also has contracts with 31 not-for-profit ("NFP") entities to service student loans, although five NFP servicers currently service the volume allocated to these 31 entities. The Company licenses its remote-hosted servicing software to three of the five NFP servicers.
The Department currently allocates new loan volume among the TIVAS and NFP servicers based on the following performance metrics:
•Two metrics measure the satisfaction among separate customer groups, including borrowers (35 percent) and FSA personnel who work with the servicers (5 percent).
•Three metrics measure the success of keeping borrowers in an on-time repayment status and helping borrowers avoid default as reflected by the percentage of borrowers in current repayment status (30 percent), percentage of borrowers more than 90 days but fewer than 271 days delinquent (15 percent), and percentage of borrowers over 270 days and fewer than 361 days delinquent (15 percent). The loans are evaluated in 15 different loan portfolio stratifications to account for differences in portfolios.
The allocation of ongoing volume is determined twice each year based on the performance of each servicer in relation to the other servicers. Quarterly results are compiled for each servicer. The average of the September and December quarter-end results are used to allocate volume for the period from March 1 to August 31, and the average of the March and June quarter-end results are used to allocate volume for the period from September 1 to February month end, of each year.
Under the most recent publicly announced performance metrics measurements used by the Department for the quarterly periods January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018, Great Lakes' and Nelnet Servicing's overall rankings among the nine current servicers for the Department were second and fourth, respectively. Based on these results, Great Lakes' and Nelnet Servicing's allocation of new student loan servicing volumes for the period September 1, 2018 through February 28, 2019 are 17 percent and 11 percent, respectively. 
Incremental revenue components earned by Nelnet Servicing or Great Lakes from the Department (in addition to loan servicing revenues) include:
•Administration of the Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) Discharge program. Nelnet Servicing processes applications for the TPD discharge program and is responsible for discharge, monitoring, and servicing TPD loans. Individuals who are totally and permanently disabled may qualify for a discharge of their federal student loans, and the Company processes applications under the program and receives a fee from the Department on a per application basis, as well as a monthly servicing fee during the monitoring period. Nelnet Servicing is the exclusive provider of this service to the Department.
•Origination of consolidation loans.  Beginning in 2014, the Department implemented a process to outsource the origination of consolidation loans whereby each of the four TIVAS, and beginning in December 2017, each of the NFP servicers, receives Federal Direct Loan consolidation origination volume based on borrower choice. The Department pays the Company a fee for each completed consolidation loan application it processes. Nelnet Servicing and Great Lakes each service the consolidation volume it originates.
Servicing FFELP loans
LSS, referred to as NDS, services the Company's student loan portfolio and the portfolios of third parties. The loan servicing activities include loan conversion activities, application processing, borrower updates, customer service, payment processing, due diligence procedures, funds management reconciliations, and claim processing. These activities are performed internally for the Company's portfolio, in addition to generating external fee revenue when performed for third-party clients.
 5


The Company uses proprietary systems to manage the servicing process. These systems provide for automated compliance with most of the federal student loan regulations adopted under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (the “Higher Education Act”).
The Company serviced FFELP loans on behalf of 151 third-party servicing customers as of December 31, 2018. The Company's FFELP servicing customers include national and regional banks, credit unions, and various state and nonprofit secondary markets. The majority of the Company's external FFELP loan servicing activities are performed under “life of loan” contracts, which essentially provide that as long as the applicable loan exists, the Company shall be the sole servicer of that loan; however, the agreement may contain “deconversion” provisions where, for a fee, the lender may move the loan to another servicer.
The discontinuation of new FFELP loan originations in July 2010 has caused and will continue to cause FFELP servicing revenue to decline as these loan portfolios are paid down. However, the Company believes there may be opportunities to service additional FFELP loan portfolios from current FFELP participants as the program winds down.
Originating and servicing private education and consumer loans
NDS conducts origination and servicing activities for private education and consumer loans. Private education loans are non-federal loans made to students or their families; as such, the loans are not issued or guaranteed by the federal government. These loans are used primarily to bridge the gap between the cost of higher education and the amount funded through financial aid, federal loans, or the borrowers' personal resources. Although similar in terms of activities and functions as FFELP loan servicing (i.e., application processing, disbursement processing, payment processing, customer service, statement distribution, and reporting), private education loan servicing activities are not required to comply with provisions of the Higher Education Act and may be more customized to individual client requirements.
The Company has invested and currently plans to continue to invest in modernizing key technologies and services to position its consumer loan servicing business for the long-term, expanding services to include personal loan products and other consumer installment assets. The Company is in the process of a complete re-architecting of its private education and consumer loan origination and repayment servicing systems. Improvements in systems will allow for diversified products to be both originated and serviced with state-of-the-art application and servicing platforms to drive growth for the Company's client partners. Presenting a very wide market opportunity of new entrants and existing players, consumer lending is a key growth area. In both back-up servicing and full servicing partnerships, the Company is a valuable resource for consumer lenders and asset holders as it allows for leveraged economies of scale, high compliance, and secure service to client partners.
The Company serviced private education and consumer loans on behalf of 59 third-party servicing customers as of December 31, 2018. In addition, the Company provides back-up servicing arrangements to assist 9 entities for more than 1.4 million borrowers. For a monthly fee, these arrangements require a 30 to 90 day notice from a triggering event to transfer the customer's servicing volume to the Company's platform and becoming a full servicing customer.
Providing student loan servicing software and other information technology products and services
NDS provides data center services, student loan servicing software for servicing private education and federal loans, guaranty servicing software, and consulting and professional services to support the technology platforms. These proprietary software systems are used internally by the Company and/or licensed to third-party student loan holders and servicers. These software systems have been adapted so they can be offered as hosted servicing software solutions that can be used by third parties for guaranty servicing and to service various types of student loans, including Federal Direct Loan Program and FFEL Program loans. The Company earns a monthly fee from its remote hosting customers for each loan or unique borrower on the Company's platform, with a minimum monthly charge for most contracts. As of December 31, 2018, 6.4 million borrowers were hosted on the Company's hosted servicing software solution platforms.
Providing outsourced services including call center, processing, and marketing services
The Company provides business process outsourcing specializing in contact center management. The contact center solutions and services include taking inbound calls, helping with outreach campaigns and sales, and interacting with customers through multi-channels.
Competition
The Company's scalable servicing platform allows it to provide compliant, efficient, and reliable service at a low cost, giving the Company a competitive advantage over others in the industry. The principal competitor for existing and prospective FFELP and private education loan servicing business is Navient Corporation ("Navient"). Navient is the largest for-profit provider of
 6


 servicing functions. In contrast to its competitors, the Company has segmented its private education loan servicing on a distinct platform, created specifically to meet the needs of private education student loan borrowers, their families, the schools they attend, and the lenders who serve them. This ensures access to specialized teams with a dedicated focus on servicing these borrowers.
With the elimination of new loan originations under the FFEL Program, four servicers, including Nelnet Servicing and Great Lakes, were named by the Department in 2009 as servicers of federally-owned loans. The two other servicers are FedLoan Servicing (Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency ("PHEAA")) and Navient. In addition, the Department has contracts with 31 NFP entities to service student loans that are serviced by 5 prime NFP servicers. The Company currently licenses its hosted servicing software to three prime NFP servicers that represent 13 NFP organizations. PHEAA is the only other TIVAS servicer offering a hosted Federal Direct Loan Program servicing solution to the NFP servicers.
The Company is one of the leaders in the development of servicing software for guaranty agencies, consumer and private education loan programs, the Federal Direct Loan Program, and FFELP student loans. Many student loan lenders and servicers utilize the Company's software either directly or indirectly. The Company believes the investments it has made to scale its systems and to create a secure infrastructure to support the Department's servicing volume and requirements increase its competitive advantage as a long-term partner in the loan servicing market.
Education Technology, Services, and Payment Processing
ETS&PP, referred to as NBS, provides products and services to help students and families manage the payment of education costs at all levels (K-12 and higher education). It also provides innovative education-focused technologies, services, and support solutions to help schools automate administrative processes and collect and process commerce data. The Company also provides to K-12 schools professional development and educational instruction services and provides payment technology and services for software platforms, businesses, and nonprofits beyond the K-12 and higher education space. 
The majority of this segment's customers are located in the United States; however, the Company has begun providing its products and services in Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia, and currently believes there are opportunities to increase its customer base and revenues internationally.
See the MD&A - "Education Technology, Services, and Payment Processing Operating Segment - Results of Operations" for a discussion of the seasonality of the business in this operating segment.
K-12 
In the K-12 market, the Company (known as FACTS Management) offers (i) actively managed tuition payment plans and billing services; (ii) assistance with financial needs assessment and donor management; (iii) school information system software that helps schools automate administrative processes such as admissions, enrollment, scheduling, student billing, attendance, and grade book management; (iv) professional development and educational instruction services; and (v) innovative technology products that aid in teacher and student evaluations. The Company provides services for over 11,500 K-12 schools and serves nearly 4.0 million students and families.
The Company is the market leader in actively managed tuition payment plans and financial needs assessment services. Tuition management services include payment plan administration, incidental billing, accounts receivable management, and record keeping. K-12 educational institutions contract with the Company to administer deferred payment plans that allow families to make recurring payments generally over six to 12 months. The Company collects a fee from either the institution or the payer as an administration fee. 
The Company's financial needs assessment service helps K-12 schools evaluate and determine the amount of financial aid to disburse to the families it serves. The Company's donor services allow schools to assess and deliver strategic fundraising solutions using the latest technology.
In 2018, the Company completed a significant rebranding effort bringing the RenWeb School Management Solutions brand under the FACTS Management brand, now referring to RenWeb as FACTS SIS. FACTS SIS provides school information systems to help schools automate administrative processes such as admissions, enrollment, scheduling, student billing, attendance, and grade book management. The Company’s information systems software is sold as a subscription service to schools. The Company also offers a streamlined, social, and fully integrated learning management system to enhance classroom instruction for both teachers and students. The combination of the Company’s school administration software and tuition management and financial needs assessment services has significantly increased the value of the Company’s offerings in this area, allowing the Company to deliver a comprehensive suite of solutions to schools. Under the PCSchools brand, the Company offers school information systems to schools in Australia and New Zealand as well.

Under the brand FACTS Education Solutions, the Company provides customized professional development services for teachers and school leaders as well as instructional services for students experiencing academic challenges. These services provide continuous advance learning and professional development while helping private schools identify and attain equitable participation in federal education programs. FACTS Education Solutions also offers innovative technology advancing products that aid in both teacher and student evaluation.
Higher Education
In the higher education market, the Company (known as Nelnet Campus Commerce) offers two principal products: actively managed tuition payment plans, and education technologies and payment processing. The Company provides service for 1,400 colleges and universities worldwide and serves 7.7 million students and families. 
Higher education institutions contract with the Company to administer actively managed payment plans that allow the student and family to make recurring payments on either a semester or annual basis. The Company collects a fee from the student or family as an administration fee. 
The Company's suite of education technology solutions provides services that allow for families' electronic billing and payment of campus charges. Education technologies includes cashiering for face-to-face transactions, campus-wide commerce management, and refunds management, among other activities. The Company earns revenue for e-billing, hosting and maintenance, credit card processing fees, and e-payment transaction fees, which are powered by the Company's secure payment processing systems.
The Company's education technology products are sold as a subscription service to colleges and universities. The systems process payments through the appropriate channels in the banking or credit card networks to make deposits into the client's bank account. The systems can be further deployed to other departments around campus as requested (e.g., application fees, alumni giving, parking, events, etc.).
Through the brand Unilink, the Company offers education technology and payment processing to higher education institutions in Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia.
Non-education services
Under the brands PaymentSpring and Aware3, the Company has expanded its customer base to include both education and non-education customers. PaymentSpring offers technology and payments services including electronic transfer and credit card processing, reporting, billing and invoicing, mobile and virtual terminal solutions, and specialized integrations to business software. Aware3 is a mobile first technology focused on increasing engagement, online giving, and communication for church and not-for-profit customers.
Competition
The Company is the largest provider of tuition management and financial needs assessment services to the private and faith-based K-12 market in the United States. Competitors include financial institutions, tuition management providers, financial needs assessment providers, accounting firms, and a myriad of software companies. 
In the higher education market, the Company targets business offices at colleges and universities. In this market, the primary competition is limited to only a few campus commerce and tuition payment providers, as well as solutions developed in-house by colleges and universities. 
The Company's principal competitive advantages are (i) the customer service it provides to institutions and consumers, (ii) the technology provided with the Company's service, and (iii) the Company's ability to integrate its technology with the institution clients and their third party service providers. The Company believes its clients select products primarily based on technology features, functionality, and the ability to integrate with other systems, but price and service also impact the selection process. 
Acquisition of Tuition Management Systems
In November 2018, the Company acquired Tuition Management Systems ("TMS"), a services company that offers tuition payment plans, billing services, payment technology solutions, and refund management to educational institutions. The TMS acquisition added 380 higher education schools and 170 K-12 schools to the Company's customer base, further enhancing NBS’ market share leading position with private faith-based K-12 schools and advancing to a market leading position in higher education.

Communications
The Company provides communication services through ALLO, a majority owned subsidiary. ALLO derives its revenue primarily from the sale of telecommunication services, including internet, telephone, and television services, to business and residential customers in Nebraska and Colorado, and specializes in high-speed internet and broadband services available through its all-fiber network. ALLO currently serves the Scottsbluff, Gering, Bridgeport, North Platte, Ogallala, Alliance, Lincoln, and Hastings communities in Nebraska, and Fort Morgan, Colorado. Total households in these communities is approximately 153,000. As of December 31, 2018, the Company provided services to approximately 37,000 households, an increase of almost 17,000, or 83 percent, from the prior year. ALLO plans to continue to increase market share and revenue in its existing markets and is currently evaluating opportunities to expand to additional communities.
Internet and television services 
Internet and television services include data and video products and services to residential and business subscribers. ALLO data services provide high-speed internet access over ALLO's all-fiber network at various symmetrical speeds up to 1 gigabit per second for residential customers, depending on the nature of the network facilities that are available, the level of service selected, and the geographic market availability. ALLO also offers a variety of data connectivity services for businesses, including Ethernet services capable of multiple connections over ALLO's fiber-based networks. ALLO's Internet Protocol Television Video ("IPTV") services range from limited basic service to advanced television, which includes several plans, each with hundreds of local, national, and music channels, including premium and pay-per-view channels, as well as video on demand service. Subscribers may also subscribe to ALLO's advanced video services, which consist of high definition television, digital video recorders (“DVR”), and/or a whole home DVR. ALLO's whole home DVR gives customers the ability to watch recorded shows on any television in the house, record multiple shows at one time, and utilize an intuitive on-screen guide and user interface. 
ALLO expects that internet services will continue to increase as a more significant component of its overall services, and offset the anticipated decline in traditional residential telephone and television services.
Telephone services
Local calling services include a full suite of telephone services, including basic services, primary rate interface ("PRI"), and session initiation protocol ("SIP"). ALLO's service plans include options for voicemail and other enhanced custom calling features including hunting, caller ID, call forwarding, and call waiting, among others. Services are charged at a fixed monthly rate or can be bundled with selected services at a discounted rate. ALLO provides a hosted private branch exchange ("PBX") package, which utilizes a soft switch and allows the customer the flexibility of utilizing new telephone technology and features without investing in a new telephone system. The package bundles local service, calling features, and internet protocol (“IP”) business telephones. 
Long-distance services include traditional domestic and international long distance, which enables customers to make calls that terminate outside their local calling area. These services also include toll-free calls and conference calling. ALLO offers a variety of long distance plans, including unlimited flat-rate calling plans, and offers a combination of subscription and usage fees. 
Sales and marketing 
The key components of ALLO's overall marketing strategy include: 
•Promoting the advantages of an all-fiber network connected directly to homes and businesses capable of delivering synchronous internet speeds of over one gigabit per second 
•Building complete fiber communities by passing all homes and businesses within its network
•Organizing sales and marketing activities around consumer, enterprise, and carrier customers
•Positioning ALLO as a single point of contact for customers’ communications needs
•Providing customers with a broad array of internet, television, and telephone services and bundling these services whenever possible
•Providing excellent local customer service, including 24/7/365 customer support to coordinate installation of new services, repair, and maintenance functions
•Developing and delivering new services to meet evolving customer needs and market demands
•Utilizing proven modern technology to deliver services
 9


ALLO currently offers services through social media platforms, direct marketing, call centers, its website, communication centers, and commissioned sales representatives. ALLO markets its services both individually and as bundled services, including its triple-play offering of internet, television, and telephone services. By bundling service offerings, ALLO is able to offer and sell a more complete and competitive package of services, which simultaneously increases its margin per customer and adds value for the consumer or business. ALLO also believes that bundling leads to increased customer loyalty and retention.
Network architecture and technology
ALLO has made significant investments in its technologically advanced telecommunications networks. As a result, ALLO is able to deliver high-quality, reliable internet, telephone, and television services through fiber optics. ALLO's wide-ranging network and extensive use of fiber provide an easy reach into existing and new areas. By bringing the fiber network to the customer premises, ALLO can increase its service offerings, quality, and bandwidth services. ALLO's existing fiber network enables it to efficiently respond and adapt to changes in technology and is capable of supporting the rising customer demand for bandwidth in order to support the growing number of internet devices in the home. ALLO's all-fiber network enhances its operating efficiencies by facilitating new network and technology choices that provide for lower costs to operate. ALLO's networks are supported by an advanced digital telephone switch and IPTV service platform. The digital switch provides all local telephone customers with access to a full suite of telecommunication products, custom calling features, and value-added services. ALLO's fiber network utilizes fiber-to-the-premise (“FTTP”) networks to offer bundled residential and commercial services. ALLO leverages its high definition IPTV headend equipment to distribute content across its network, allowing it to provide a sharp video picture and to better manage costs of future channel additions and upgrades. ALLO's network provides substantially all of its marketable homes and businesses with bandwidth of 1 gigabit per second or more.
Growth strategy
As discussed above, ALLO plans to increase its customer base with its superior all-fiber network by increasing its share in existing markets and potentially entering additional markets currently served by carriers using traditional copper and coaxial cable in their telecommunications networks. In addition, ALLO is focused on increasing revenues per customer by capitalizing on increased demand for bandwidth by commercial and residential customers and introducing new value add products.
Competition
Telecommunications businesses are highly competitive and continue to face increased competition as a result of technology changes and industry legislative and regulatory developments. ALLO faces actual or potential competition from many existing and emerging companies, including incumbent and competitive local telephone companies, long distance carriers and resellers, wireless companies, internet service providers ("ISPs"), satellite companies, cable television companies, and in some cases by new forms of providers who are able to offer competitive services through software applications, requiring a comparatively small initial investment. Due to consolidation and strategic alliances within the industry, ALLO cannot predict the number of competitors it will face at any given time. The wireless business has expanded significantly, causing many residential subscribers of traditional telephone services to discontinue those services and rely exclusively on wireless service. Consumers are finding individual television shows of interest to them through the internet and are watching content that is downloaded to their computers. Some providers, including television and cable television content owners, have initiated what are referred to as “over-the-top” services that deliver video content to televisions and computers over the internet. The incumbent telephone carriers in the markets ALLO serves enjoy certain business advantages, including size, financial resources, favorable regulatory position, a more diverse product mix, brand recognition, and connection to virtually all of ALLO's customers and potential customers. The largest cable operators also enjoy certain business advantages, including size, financial resources, ownership of or superior access to desirable programming and other content, a more diverse product mix, brand recognition, and first-in-the-field advantages with a customer base that generates positive cash flow for its operations. ALLO's competitors continue to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services comparable to the services ALLO offers. Their success in selling some services competitive with ALLO's can lead to revenue erosion in other related areas. ALLO faces intense competition in its markets for long distance, internet access, and other ancillary services that are important to ALLO's business and to its growth strategy.

Asset Generation and Management
AGM includes the acquisition, management, and ownership of the Company's loan assets. Loans consist of federally insured student loans (originated under the FFEL Program), private education loans, and consumer loans. Substantially all of the Company's loan portfolio (98.5 percent as of December 31, 2018) is federally insured. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's loan portfolio was $22.4 billion. The Company generates a substantial portion of its earnings from the spread, referred to as the Company's loan spread, between the yield it receives on its loan portfolio and the associated costs to finance such portfolio. See the MD&A - "Asset Generation and Management Operating Segment - Results of Operations - Loan Spread Analysis,” for further details related to the loan spread. The student loan assets are held in a series of education lending subsidiaries and associated securitization trusts designed specifically for this purpose. In addition to the loan spread earned on its portfolio, all costs and activity associated with managing the portfolio, such as servicing of the assets and debt maintenance, are included in this segment.
The Company's portfolio of federally insured student loans is subject to minimal credit risk, as these loans are guaranteed by the Department at levels ranging from 97 percent to 100 percent. The Higher Education Act regulates every aspect of the federally insured student loan program, including certain communications with borrowers, loan originations, and default aversion. Failure to service a student loan properly could jeopardize the guarantee on federal student loans. In the case of death, disability, or bankruptcy of the borrower, the guarantee covers 100 percent of the loan's principal and accrued interest. FFELP loans are guaranteed by state agencies or nonprofit companies designated as guarantors, with the Department providing reinsurance to the guarantor. Guarantors are responsible for performing certain functions necessary to ensure the program's soundness and accountability. Generally, the guarantor is responsible for ensuring that loans are serviced in compliance with the requirements of the Higher Education Act. When a borrower defaults on a FFELP loan, the Company submits a claim to the guarantor, who provides reimbursements of principal and accrued interest, subject to the applicable risk share percentage.
The Company's portfolios of private education loans and consumer loans are subject to credit risk and defaults may increase above current levels based on numerous factors, including a worsening economy or an increase in unemployment or a decrease in the availability of credit. The Company began to purchase consumer loans in 2017.
Origination and acquisition
The Reconciliation Act of 2010 discontinued originations of new FFELP loans, effective July 1, 2010.   However, the Company believes there will be ongoing opportunities to continue to purchase FFELP loan portfolios from current FFELP participants looking to exit or adjust their FFELP businesses. For example, from July 1, 2010 through December 31, 2018, the Company purchased a total of $25.1 billion of FFELP student loans from various third parties, including a total of $3.7 billion during 2018. However, since all FFELP loans will eventually run off, a key objective of the Company is to reposition itself for the post-FFELP environment. As such, the Company is actively expanding its private education and consumer loan portfolios. The Company's competition for the purchase of loan portfolios and residuals includes large banks, hedge funds, and other student loan finance companies.
Interest rate risk management
Since the Company generates a significant portion of its earnings from its loan spread, the interest rate sensitivity of the Company's balance sheet is very important to its operations. The current and future interest rate environment can and will affect the Company's interest income and net income. The effects on the Company's results of operations as a result of the changing interest rate environments are further outlined in the MD&A - "Asset Generation and Management Operating Segment - Results of Operations - Loan Spread Analysis" and Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.” 
Corporate and Other Activities
Whitetail Rock Capital Management, LLC ("WRCM")
As of December 31, 2018, WRCM, the Company's SEC-registered investment advisor subsidiary, had $1.25 billion in assets under management for third-party customers, consisting primarily of student loan asset-backed securities. WRCM earns annual management fees of 25 basis points for asset-backed securities under management and up to 50 percent of the gains from the sale of securities or securities being called prior to the full contractual maturity for which it provides advisory services. During 2018, WRCM traded $0.88 billion for its customers, which generated $3.3 million in performance fees and earned $2.8 million in management fees. Assuming assets under management remain at their current levels, management fees should be relatively stable in future years. However, the Company currently anticipates that opportunities for WRCM to earn performance fees could be more limited in future years.

Real estate and other investments
The Company makes investments to further diversify itself both within and outside of its historical core education-related businesses, including investments in real estate and early-stage and emerging growth companies. Recent real estate investments have been focused on the development of commercial properties in the Midwest, and particularly in Lincoln, Nebraska, where the Company is headquartered. These investments include projects for the development of properties in Lincoln’s east downtown Telegraph District, where a new facility for the Company’s student loan servicing operations is located, and a building in Lincoln’s Haymarket District that is the new headquarters of Hudl, an online video analysis and coaching tools software company for athletes of all levels. The Company is also a tenant at Hudl's headquarters. David S. Graff, a member of the Company’s board of directors, is a co-founder, the chief executive officer, and a director of Hudl. In addition, the Company has a total equity investment in Hudl of $51.8 million. 
Regulation and Supervision
The Company's operating segments and industry partners are heavily regulated by federal and state government regulatory agencies. The following provides a summary of the more significant existing and proposed legislation and regulations affecting the Company. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject the Company to substantial fines, penalties, and remedial and other costs, restrictions on business, and the loss of business. Regulations and supervision can change rapidly, and changes could alter the manner in which the Company operates and increase the Company's operating expenses as new or additional regulatory compliance requirements are addressed.
Loan Servicing and Systems
NDS, which services Federal Direct Loan Program, FFELP, and private education and consumer loans, is subject to federal and state consumer protection, privacy, and related laws and regulations. Some of the more significant federal laws and regulations include:
•The Higher Education Act, which establishes financial responsibility and administrative capability requirements that govern all third-party servicers of federally insured student loans
•The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), which governs communication methods that may be used to contact customers
•The Truth-In-Lending Act ("TILA") and Regulation Z, which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers
•The Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA") and Regulation V, which governs the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies
•The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ("ECOA") and Regulation B, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other prohibited factors in extending credit
•The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (“SCRA”), which applies to all debts incurred prior to commencement of active military service and limits the amount of interest, including certain fees or charges that are related to the obligation or liability
•The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E, which protects individual consumers engaged in electronic fund transfers (“EFTs”)
•The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and Regulation P, which govern a financial institution’s treatment of nonpublic personal information about consumers and requires that an institution, under certain circumstances, notify consumers about its privacy policies and practices
•Laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ("UDAAP")
•Various laws, regulations, and standards that govern government contractors
As a student loan servicer for the federal government and for financial institutions, including the Company’s FFELP student loan portfolio, the Company is subject to the Higher Education Act and related laws, rules, regulations, and policies. The Higher Education Act regulates every aspect of the federally insured student loan program. The Company has designed its servicing operations to comply with the Higher Education Act, and it regularly monitors the Company's operations to maintain compliance. 
Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or damages of $500 per violation, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. In addition, TCPA lawsuits have asserted putative class action claims.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which has broad authority to regulate a wide range of consumer financial products and services. The Company's student loan servicing business is subject to CFPB oversight authority.
 12


In 2015, the CFPB conducted a public inquiry into student loan servicing practices throughout the industry and issued a report discussing public comments submitted in response to the inquiry, and suggesting a framework to improve borrower outcomes and reduce defaults, including the creation of consistent, industry-wide standards for the entire servicing market.
The CFPB has authority to draft new regulations implementing federal consumer financial protection laws, to enforce those laws and regulations, and to conduct examinations of the Company's operations to determine compliance. The CFPB’s authority includes the ability to assess financial penalties and fines and provide for restitution to consumers if it determines there have been violations of consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB also provides consumer financial education, tracks consumer complaints, requests data from industry participants, and promotes the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent, and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. The CFPB’s scrutiny of financial services has impacted industry participants’ approach to their services, including how the Company interacts with consumers.
The Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations of state law. Most states also have statutes that prohibit unfair and deceptive practices. To the extent states enact requirements that differ from federal standards or state officials and courts adopt interpretations of federal consumer laws that differ from those adopted by the CFPB under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company's ability to offer the same products and services to consumers nationwide may be limited.
As a third-party service provider to financial institutions, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”). FFIEC is a formal interagency body of the U.S. government empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions by the Federal Reserve Banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), and the CFPB, and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions.
Education Technology, Services, and Payment Processing
NBS provides tuition management services and school information software for K-12 schools and tuition management services and payment processing solutions for higher education institutions. The Company also provides payment technologies and payment services for software platforms, businesses, and nonprofits beyond the K-12 and higher education space. As a service provider that takes payment instructions from institutions and their constituents and sends them to bank partners, the Company is directly or indirectly subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations. The Company's contracts with clients and bank partners require the Company to comply with these laws and regulations.
The Company's payment processing services are subject to the EFTA and Regulation E, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of debit cards and certain other electronic banking services. The Company assists bank partners with fulfilling their compliance obligations pursuant to these requirements. 
The Company's payment processing services are also subject to the National Automated Clearing House Association (“NACHA”) requirements, which include operating rules and sound risk management procedures to govern the use of the Automated Clearing House ("ACH") Network. These rules are used to ensure that the ACH Network is efficient, reliable, and secure for its members. Because the ACH Network uses a batch process, the importance of proper submissions by NACHA members is magnified. The Company is also impacted by laws and regulations that affect the bankcard industry. The Company is registered with Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and the Discover Network as a service provider and is subject to their respective rules.
The Company's higher education institution clients are subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), which protects the privacy of student education records. These clients disclose certain non-directory information concerning their students to the Company, including contact information, student identification numbers, and the amount of students’ credit balances pursuant to one or more exceptions under FERPA. Additionally, as the Company is indirectly subject to FERPA, it may not permit the transfer of any personally identifiable information to another party other than in a manner in which an educational institution may properly disclose it. While the Company believes that it has adequate policies and procedures in place to safeguard the privacy of such information, a breach of this prohibition could result in a five-year suspension of the Company's access to the related client’s records. The Company may also be subject to similar state laws and regulations that restrict higher education institutions from disclosing certain personally identifiable student information.
 13


Some of the Company's K-12 and higher education institution clients choose to charge convenience fees to students, parents, or other payers who make online payments using a credit or debit card. Laws and regulations related to such fees vary from state to state and certain states have laws that to varying degrees prohibit the imposition of a surcharge on a cardholder who elects to use a credit or debit card in lieu of cash, check, or other means. 
The Company's contracts with higher education institution clients also require the Company to comply with regulations promulgated by the Department regarding the handling of student financial aid funds received by institutions on behalf of their students under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. These regulations are designed to ensure students have convenient access to their Title IV funds, do not incur unreasonable fees, and are not led to believe they must open a financial account to receive such funds. 
Communications
The telecommunications business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“Telecommunications Act”), federal and state regulators share responsibility for implementing and enforcing statutes and regulations designed to encourage competition and to preserve and advance widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices.
At the federal level, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") generally exercises jurisdiction over facilities and services of local exchange carriers to the extent they are used to provide, originate, or terminate interstate or international communications. The FCC has the authority to condition, modify, cancel, terminate, or revoke operating authority for failure to comply with applicable federal laws or FCC rules, regulations, and policies.
State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over carriers’ facilities and services to the extent they are used to provide, originate, or terminate intrastate communications. These regulatory commissions may dictate service standards and may require the payment of fees to remain in good standing with the applicable regulatory commission. In addition, municipalities and other local government agencies regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate networks. 
The Communications Act of 1934 ("Communications Act") requires, among other things, that telecommunications carriers offer services at just and reasonable rates and on non-discriminatory terms and conditions. The 1996 amendments to the Communications Act, contained in the Telecommunications Act, dramatically changed, and likely will continue to change, the landscape of the telecommunications industry. The central aim of the Telecommunications Act is to open local telecommunications markets to competition while enhancing universal service. The Telecommunications Act imposes a number of interconnection and other requirements on all local communications providers. All telecommunications carriers have a duty to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers. 
Municipalities where ALLO operates may require ALLO to obtain permits for street opening and construction.  These permits or other licenses or agreements typically require the payment of fees. In addition, ALLO's aerial and underground construction operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace.
Internet services
The provision of internet access services is not significantly regulated by either the FCC or the state commissions. However, the FCC has in recent years taken some steps toward the imposition of some controls on the provision of internet access, and has asserted that it has jurisdictional authority in some areas related to the promotion of an open internet. The extent of the FCC’s jurisdiction with respect to the internet has not been resolved, and this lack of resolution could lead to increased costs for ALLO in connection with its provision of internet services and affect ALLO's ability to effectively compete.
As the internet has matured, it has become the subject of increasing regulatory interest. Congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures directly or potentially affecting internet use, including, for example, consumer privacy, copyright protections, defamation liability, taxation, obscenity, and unsolicited commercial email. ALLO's internet services are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ("CALEA") requirements regarding law enforcement surveillance. Content owners are now seeking additional legal mechanisms to combat copyright infringement over the internet. Pending and future legislation in this area could adversely affect ALLO's operations as an ISP and relationship with internet customers. Additionally, the FCC and Congress are considering subjecting internet access services to the Universal Service funding requirements. These funding requirements could impose significant new costs on ALLO's high-speed internet service. State and local governmental organizations have also adopted internet-related regulations. These various governmental jurisdictions are also considering additional regulations in these and other areas, such as privacy, pricing, service and product quality, and taxation. The adoption of new internet regulations or the adaptation of existing laws to the internet could adversely affect ALLO's business.
 14


In 2015, an FCC Net Neutrality Order went into effect. On December 14, 2017, the FCC voted to repeal the Open Internet Order and effectively the net neutrality rules. The previous rules prohibited ISPs from engaging in blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization, and transparency rules compelling the disclosure of network management policies were enhanced. The FCC was also granted the authority under the rules to hear complaints and take enforcement action if it determined that the interconnection activities of ISPs were not just and reasonable, or if ISPs failed to meet general obligations not to harm consumers or what are referred to as edge providers. The final version of the net neutrality repeal order restores the Federal Trade Commission's jurisdiction over broadband internet access services. The uncertainty around how the Federal Trade Commission will respond and challenges to the FCC repeal could limit ALLO’s ability to efficiently manage internet service and respond to operational and competitive challenges.
Although the FCC approved the repeal of Net Neutrality regulations, ALLO’s views on the consumer protection aspect of Net Neutrality remain intact. ALLO will continue to treat internet speeds and access as they were under Net Neutrality regulations.
Television services
Federal regulations currently restrict the prices that cable systems charge for the minimum level of television programming service, referred to as “basic service,” and associated equipment. All other television service offerings are now universally exempt from rate regulation. Although basic service rate regulation operates pursuant to a federal formula, local governments, commonly referred to as local franchising authorities, are primarily responsible for administering this regulation. The majority of ALLO's local franchising authorities have never been certified to regulate basic service cable rates (and order rate reductions and refunds), but they generally retain the right to do so (subject to potential regulatory limitations under state franchising laws), except in those specific communities facing “effective competition,” as defined under federal law. There have been frequent calls to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable industry. As a result of rapidly increasing cable programming costs, it is possible that Congress may adopt new constraints on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming. Federal rate regulations currently include certain marketing restrictions that could affect ALLO's pricing and packaging of service tiers and equipment. As ALLO attempts to respond to a changing marketplace with competitive pricing practices, it may face regulations that impede its ability to compete.
IPTV operations require state or local franchise or other authorization in order to provide cable service to customers. ALLO is subject to regulation under a Communications Act framework that addresses such issues as the use of local streets and rights of way; the carriage of public, educational, and governmental channels; the provision of channel space for leased commercial access; the amount and payment of franchise fees; consumer protection; and similar issues. In addition, federal laws and FCC regulations place limits on the common ownership of cable systems and competing multichannel television distribution systems, and on the common ownership of cable systems and local telephone systems in the same geographic area. The FCC has recently expanded its oversight and regulation of cable television-related matters. Federal law and regulations also affect numerous issues related to television programming and other content. Under federal law, certain local television broadcast stations (both commercial and non-commercial) can elect, every three years, to take advantage of rules that require a cable operator to distribute the station’s content to the cable system’s customers without charge, or to forego this “must-carry” obligation and to negotiate for carriage on an arm’s length contractual basis, which typically involves the payment of a fee by the cable operator, and sometimes involves other consideration as well. The current three-year cycle began on January 1, 2018. ALLO has negotiated agreements with the local television broadcast stations that would have been eligible for “must carry” treatment in each of its current markets. The contractual relationships between cable operators and most providers of content who are not television broadcast stations generally are not subject to FCC oversight or other regulation.
The Communications Act requires most utilities owning utility poles to provide access to poles and conduits, and subjects the rates charged for this access to either federal or state regulation. The FCC's pole attachment rules promote broadband deployment through the ability to access investor-owned utility poles on reasonable rates, terms, and conditions, subject to penalties in certain cases involving unauthorized attachments.  
ALLO's IPTV systems are subject to a federal copyright compulsory license covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals. The possible modification or elimination of this copyright compulsory license is the subject of continuing legislative proposals and administrative review and could adversely affect ALLO's ability to obtain desired broadcast programming. Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations. IPTV operators also must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights organizations. These licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the past, and license fee disputes may arise in the future.
 15


Telephone services
ALLO offers voice communications services over a broadband network. The FCC has ruled that competitive telephone companies are entitled to interconnect with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that services can compete in the market. The FCC has also declared that certain services are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation. The full extent of the FCC preemption of state and local regulation of services is not yet clear. 
Corporate
Governmental bodies in the United States and abroad have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations restricting the transfer and requiring the safeguarding of nonpublic personal information. For example, in the United States, the Company and its financial institution clients are, respectively, subject to the Federal Trade Commission’s and the federal banking regulators’ privacy and information safeguarding requirements under the GLBA. With certain exceptions, the GLBA prohibits a financial institution from disclosing a consumer’s nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless the institution satisfies various notice requirements and the consumer does not elect to prevent, or “opt out of,” the disclosure. The GLBA also imposes specific requirements regarding the disclosure of customer account numbers and the reuse and redisclosure of information a financial institution provides to a third party. Additionally, the European Union ("EU") has adopted a General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which went into effect in May 2018. The GDPR imposes significant new requirements on businesses that collect and process personal data of individuals residing in the EU, and provides for significant fines and other penalties for non-compliance. While the Company's operations are subject to certain provisions of these privacy laws, the Company has limited use of consumer information solely to providing services to other businesses and financial institutions. The Company limits sharing of nonpublic personal information to that necessary to complete transactions on behalf of the consumer and to that permitted by federal and state laws.
Intellectual Property
The Company owns numerous trademarks and service marks (“Marks”) to identify its various products and services. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 57 registered Marks. The Company actively asserts its rights to these Marks when it believes infringement may exist. The Company believes its Marks have developed and continue to develop strong brand-name recognition in the industry and the consumer marketplace. Each of the Marks has, upon registration, an indefinite duration so long as the Company continues to use the Mark on or in connection with such goods or services as the Mark identifies. In order to protect the indefinite duration, the Company makes filings to continue registration of the Marks. The Company owns one patent application that has been published, but has not yet been issued, and has also actively asserted its rights thereunder in situations where the Company believes its claims may be infringed upon. The Company owns many copyright protected works, including its various computer system codes and displays, websites, and marketing materials. The Company also has trade secret rights to many of its processes and strategies and its software product designs. The Company's software products are protected by both registered and common law copyrights, as well as strict confidentiality and ownership provisions placed in license agreements, which restrict the ability to copy, distribute, or improperly disclose the software products. The Company also has adopted internal procedures designed to protect the Company's intellectual property.
The Company seeks federal and/or state protection of intellectual property when deemed appropriate, including patent, trademark/service mark, and copyright. The decision whether to seek such protection may depend on the perceived value of the intellectual property, the likelihood of securing protection, the cost of securing and maintaining that protection, and the potential for infringement. The Company's employees are trained in the fundamentals of intellectual property, intellectual property protection, and infringement issues. The Company's employees are also required to sign agreements requiring, among other things, confidentiality of trade secrets, assignment of inventions, and non-solicitation of other employees post-termination. Consultants, suppliers, and other business partners are also required to sign nondisclosure agreements to protect the Company's proprietary rights.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 6,200 employees. None of the Company's employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company is not involved in any material disputes with any of its employees, and the Company believes that relations with its employees are good.
