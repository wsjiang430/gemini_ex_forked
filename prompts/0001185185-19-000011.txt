ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
AngioSoma is a wellness company marketing a line of nutraceutical supplements under our SomaCeuticalsTM identity as well as continuing to pursue the clinical stage pharmaceutical drug LiprostinTM focused on improving the effectiveness of current standard-of-care treatments, especially related to endovascular interventions in the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD).
 
We acquired all intellectual property rights to LiprostinTM, and were issued a patent for a controlled drug delivery system. It uses the generic drug, AlprostadilTM, combined with Prostaglandin E1which effectively treats Peripheral Artery Disease or PAD. There is significant opportunity with 8 million US diagnosed cases of PAD costing $212 - $389 billion annually. PAD costs exceed diabetes, coronary artery disease and cancers. It is reported that 60% to 70% of diabetics contract peripheral artery disease, often resulting in amputation as treatment. LiprostinTM has a significant history but of greatest interest was the clinical data treating diabetic ulcers. We are in discussions with several contract research organizations for completion of our FDA protocol for Phase III and submission of our new drug application for marketing in the US and its territories.
