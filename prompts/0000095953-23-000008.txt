Item 1. Business
Ascent Industries Co. is an industrials company focused on the production and distribution of industrial tubular products including stainless steel and galvanized pipe and tube, seamless carbon pipe and tube, and specialty chemicals. Ascent Industries Co. was incorporated in 1958 as the successor to a chemical manufacturing business founded in 1945 known as Blackman Uhler Industries Inc. On August 5, 2022, we filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to change our corporate name from Synalloy Corporation to Ascent Industries Co., effective August 10, 2022. The Company's executive office is located at 1400 16th Street, Suite 270, Oak Brook, Illinois 60523. Unless indicated otherwise, the terms "Ascent", "Company," "we" "us," and "our" refer to Ascent Industries Co. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
The Company's business is divided into two reportable operating segments, Tubular Products and Specialty Chemicals. The Tubular Products segment serves markets through pipe and tube and customers in the appliance, architectural, automotive and commercial transportation, brewery, chemical, petrochemical, pulp and paper, mining, power generation (including nuclear), water and waste-water treatment, liquid natural gas ("LNG"), food processing, pharmaceutical, oil and gas and other industries.
The Specialty Chemicals segment produces specialty products for the pulp and paper, coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers (CASE), textile, automotive, household, industrial and institutional ("HII"), agricultural, water and waste-water treatment, construction, oil and gas and other industries.
General
Tubular Products – Tubular Products is comprised of BRISMET, located in Bristol, Tennessee and Munhall, Pennsylvania; ASTI, located in Troutman and Statesville, North Carolina; Palmer, located in Andrews, Texas; and Specialty, located in Mineral Ridge, Ohio and Houston, Texas.
BRISMET manufactures welded pipe and tube, primarily from stainless steel, duplex, and nickel alloys. Pipe is produced in sizes from 3/8 inch outside diameter to 144 inches outside diameter and wall thickness from 1/4 inch up to 1 and 3/8 inches. Pipe smaller than 18 inches in outside diameter is made on equipment that forms and welds the pipe in a continuous process. Pipe larger than 18 inches in outside diameter is formed on presses or rolls and welded using a batch welding technique. Pipe is normally produced in standard 20-foot lengths, although BRISMET also has capabilities in the production of pipe without circumferential welds in lengths up to 60 feet. BRISMET is one of the few domestic producers capable of making pipe in 48-foot lengths up to 36 inches in diameter. Additionally, BRISMET's Munhall facility manufactures ornamental stainless tube and galvanized carbon tube, as well as similar stainless pipe products as produced at the Bristol facility. As of December 31, 2022, the Company made the decision to pursue an exit of the galvanized steel pipe and tube business at its Munhall facility. The Company is in the process of winding down operations and expects to permanently cease the production of galvanized steel pipe and tube in the first half of 2023.
ASTI is a leading manufacturer of high-end ornamental stainless steel tube, supplying the automotive, commercial transportation, marine, food services, construction, furniture, healthcare, and other industries. ASTI's facilities are located in Troutman and Statesville, North Carolina. ASTI incorporates proprietary finishing capabilities and the highest levels of customer service and technical support to provide the customer with the highest quality ornamental products available in the market. ASTI's product range includes a variety of shapes, including rounds, squares, rectangles and ellipticals up to 5 inches outside diameter.
Palmer is a manufacturer of fiberglass and steel storage tanks for the oil and gas, waste water treatment and municipal water industries. As of December 31, 2021, the Company permanently ceased operations and is in the process of divesting all remaining assets at the facility. The operating results of our Palmer business in Andrews, Texas, currently held for sale, are included within the Tubular Products segment for all periods presented in this annual report. Palmer will be removed from the segment beginning in the first quarter of 2023.
Specialty is a leading master distributor of hot finish, seamless, carbon steel pipe and tube, with an emphasis on large outside diameters and exceptionally heavy wall thickness. Specialty's products are primarily used for mechanical and high-pressure applications in the oil and gas, heavy industrial, construction equipment, and chemical and other industries. Operating from facilities located in Mineral Ridge, Ohio and Houston, Texas, Specialty is well-positioned to serve the major industrial and energy regions in the United States. Specialty performs value-added processing on a majority of products shipped and 
typically processes and ships orders in 24 hours or less. Specialty plays a critical role in the domestic supply chain, by maintaining a diverse inventory of hard to find sizes of pipe and tube that support critical infrastructure applications across the United States.
The majority of raw materials used by the segment are available from numerous independent suppliers and approximately 65% of total purchases are from its top 5 suppliers. The Company does not anticipate that the loss of this supplier would have a materially adverse effect on the Company as raw materials are readily available from a number of different sources, and the Company anticipates no difficulties in fulfilling its requirements.
Specialty Chemicals – Specialty Chemicals consists of the Company's three production facilities located in Cleveland, Tennessee, Fountain Inn, South Carolina and Danville, Virginia.
The segment produces specialty formulations and intermediates for use in a wide variety of applications and industries with primary product lines focusing on the production of defoamers, surfactants, and lubricating agents. End users include companies that supply agrochemical paper, metal working, coatings, water treatment, paint, mining, oil and gas, and janitorial and other applications. The segments sulfation products represent a renewable resource and are alternatives to non-renewable petroleum derivatives. 
The segment also provides dedicated contract manufacturing services, as well as operating a multi-purpose plant with the ability to process a variety of difficult to handle materials including flammable solvents, viscous liquids and granular solids. The segment has long-term relationships with a number of leading chemical companies that outsource their manufacturing production to our production facilities allowing those customers to reach their target markets quicker.
The majority of raw materials used by the segment are available from numerous independent suppliers and approximately 31% of total purchases are from its top 5 suppliers. While some raw material needs are met by an individual supplier or only a few suppliers, the Company anticipates no difficulties in fulfilling its raw material requirements.

Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions
The Company is committed to a long-term strategy of reinvesting capital in our current business segments to foster organic growth and completing acquisitions that expand our manufacturing capabilities, product offerings and geographic footprint.
On October 22, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of DanChem Technologies, Inc. ("DanChem"). The purpose of the transaction was to accelerate product development capabilities and provide entrance into new end-markets and applications within the Specialty Chemicals segment. The purchase price was $32.95 million before adjustments for working capital, transaction expenses, cash and debt. The tangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed from DanChem included accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, real property and accounts payable. See Note 2 for additional information on the DanChem acquisition.
Environmental 
Environmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and do not contribute to future revenue generation are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or cleanups are probable and the costs of these assessments and/or cleanups can be reasonably estimated. Changes to laws and environmental issues, including climate change, are made or proposed with some frequency and some of the proposals, if adopted, might directly or 
indirectly result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units. We are presently unable to quantify this risk.
Seasonality
The Company's businesses and products are generally not subject to seasonal impacts that result in significant variations in revenues from one quarter to another.
Backlogs
The backlog of open orders for the Tubular Products segment were $49.8 million and $91.5 million at the end of 2022 and 2021, respectively. The backlog of open orders for the Specialty Chemicals segment were $10.4 million and $12.9 million at the end of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our backlog may not be indicative of actual sales and, therefore, should not be used as a direct measure of future revenue. 
Human Capital
Safety and Wellness
The health and safety of our workforce is fundamental to the success of our business. We have a long-standing commitment to the safety and health of every employee that works in our facilities.

Our business results depend on our ability to manage our human capital resources, including attracting, identifying, and retaining key talent. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees include competition from other employers, availability of qualified individuals and opportunities for employee growth.
