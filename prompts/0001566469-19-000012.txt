Item 1. Business
Overview
NantHealth is a next-generation healthcare technology company that is transforming the way critical diseases, such as cancer, are known and treated. Specifically, we employ precision medicine and technology to give physicians, payers, pharma and patients more actionable information.
To accomplish this, we employ a unique systems-based approach to personalized healthcare providing leading solutions across the continuum of care for physicians, payers patients and biopharmaceutical organizations, enabling the use of cutting edge data and technology towards the goals of empowering clinical decision support and improving patient outcomes. NantHealth’s comprehensive product portfolio combines the latest technology in molecular analysis (GPS Cancer and Liquid GPS), payer/provider collaboration platforms that exchange information in near-real time (NaviNet and Eviti), and connected care solutions that deliver Medical Device Interoperability (MDI) through vendor neutral medical device connectivity.
As a pioneer in the era of big data and augmented intelligence, we believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from multiple significant market opportunities as healthcare providers and payers transition from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement models and accelerate their pursuit of evidence-based clinical practice.
Our mission is to improve the delivery of healthcare and optimize patient outcomes by leveraging the latest advancements in precision medicine and software technology to enable true value-based care. We derive revenue from sales of software-as-a-service, licensed software and maintenance, hardware, services, and molecular analysis services (including GPS Cancer and Liquid GPS) to healthcare providers, payers and self-insured employers.
We Are Uniquely Positioned to Address Transformative Shifts across the Healthcare Continuum
The efficiency and effectiveness of the current healthcare system is often hindered by the complex, dynamic interplay of three uncoordinated and segregated domains: the knowledge domain, the care delivery domain, and the payer domain. The disparate nature of these domains, and their often-inconsistent incentives and conflicting priorities, can inhibit interoperability and coordination. We believe two simultaneous, transformative shifts are highlighting these critical deficiencies of the current healthcare environment:

1. | A rapid evolution from traditional fee-for-service to patient-centered and patient-empowered, value-based models driven by quantifiable measures of outcomes relative to cost. Unsustainable escalating healthcare costs, which we believe is due to broken fee-for-service models, is driving many stakeholders and governments towards alternative delivery models. Despite significant investments in Electronic Health Records ("EHRs") and other technologies designed to enable the transition to more value-based care, we believe that, in a fee-for-service model, the economic incentives generally discourage coordination amongst healthcare stakeholders and encourage volume-driven (rather than outcomes-driven) decision-making. This model results in healthcare and financial data that remains largely segregated into “walled gardens.” Thus, patient data often remains static and cannot be easily shared or interpreted due to siloed legacy proprietary platforms that lack interoperability.


2. | A paradigm shift to molecularly precise and real-time biometric-driven medicine, with both massive volumes and rapidly expanding repositories of complex data from traditional and novel sources. Advances in molecular medicine require healthcare providers to promptly aggregate, evaluate and synthesize hundreds to thousands of relevant facts in real time to arrive at a single patient decision. Molecular profiling often generates hundreds of gigabytes of data per patient, which must then be transported, stored, analyzed and interpreted with supercomputing and/or high-performance computing environments. We believe the rapid pace of medical advancements, the massive amount of molecular data and the frequency of biometric information is overwhelming many providers’ ability to process that information at the point of care, thereby inhibiting the paradigm shift to individualized medicine.

We believe these shifts, and the associated challenges, require next-generation and advanced technology systems that deliver more information, faster and with more relevance and accuracy than the healthcare continuum has experienced. Our unique portfolio of health care technology solutions allow us to collect, interpret and deliver data to provide decision support and help both payers and providers effectively transition to value-based care. Given the magnitude of these shifts and the difficulty involved in addressing the associated challenges, we believe our solution platforms are unmatched and serve to position NantHealth at the forefront of multiple large and growing market opportunities We have invested significant capital, healthcare and biotechnology expertise over nearly a decade to develop, acquire and integrate the components that we believe address many of the challenges faced by stakeholders across the continuum of care.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to become the leading evidence-based, personalized healthcare company transforming the way critical diseases, such as cancer, are known and treated. We seek to enable clients and clinicians to deliver improved patient outcomes and more effective treatment decisions for critical illnesses by applying novel molecular analysis tailored to the specific molecular profiles of patient tissues and blood and providing technology solutions that provide near real-time access to large scale clinical data. To accomplish this goal, we plan to deploy NantHealth solutions designed to address and accelerate the transformational shifts occurring in healthcare: rapid evolution from traditional fee-for-service to value-based models and the paradigm shift to molecularly precise and real-time biometric driven medicine. The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Driving global reimbursement, awareness, and adoption of GPS Cancer and Liquid GPS. To drive the growth of GPS Cancer and Liquid GPS in the United States, we have deployed an integrated, multi-pronged strategy to (1) obtain reimbursement through large national and regional payers and self-insured employers and (2) strategically drive oncologist awareness and adoption in those regions with reimbursement. Likewise, we are pursuing international growth through a combination of reseller agreements and other unique partnership models to yield predictable and recurring revenue. To date, we have announced agreements and agreements in principle for US insurance coverage for GPS Cancer and Liquid GPS with health plans, providers and self-insured employers, as well as reseller agreements in multiple countries outside of the US. We are also increasing recognition of GPS Cancer and Liquid GPS through strategically engaging and educating oncologists and other key oncology stakeholders, and communicating patient outcomes through peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.


• | Increasing sales of NantHealth solutions to healthcare providers, payers, pharma, and self-insured employers. We are marketing NantHealth solutions to healthcare providers transitioning from fee-for-service reimbursement models to value-based care models in pursuit of improved patient outcomes and lower costs. We believe we are positioning NantHealth as a next-generation payer intermediary and partner with healthcare payers and self-insured employers as they roll out value-based model partnerships and transition to value-based precision care.


• | Broadening usage of our solutions among existing clients. Our broad portfolio of NantHealth solutions affords us a unique ability to expand our agreements with existing clients through cross-selling opportunities. We are actively focused on leveraging existing relationships to create these opportunities to drive additional revenue for our solutions including GPS Cancer, Liquid GPS and NantHealth software solutions such as NaviNet, Eviti, DeviceConX, and VitalsConX. Many of our clients are already successfully using certain components of our solutions, and we are working to demonstrate the full value of our integrated systems infrastructure and platforms.


• | Expanding our business in international markets. We are executing our go-to-market strategies internationally, creating global awareness of our brand and taking steps towards our goal of broader adoption worldwide.


• | Developing new features and functionality for NantHealth solutions. We plan to continue to leverage NantHealth solutions to create new features and functionality that our clients can use to drive improved patient outcomes and lower the cost of care. This includes expansion of our molecular profiling portfolio, which we expect to broaden clinical utility and enhance usability.


• | Complementing internal growth with strategic acquisitions. We believe opportunities exist for us to enhance our competitive position by acquiring additional companies with complementary products and technologies and/or acquiring rights to proprietary products or technologies from third parties.

Our Industry
Today, the U.S. healthcare landscape is being redefined by the shift toward value-based reimbursement models and an explosion of the quantity, frequency and complexity of data. We believe there is a demand for platforms that utilize a molecularly precise and systems-based approach to addressing the following underlying transformative shifts and challenges.
- 6 -

A rapid evolution from traditional fee-for-service to patient-centered and patient-empowered, value-based models driven by quantifiable measures of outcomes relative to cost.
In response to the rising cost of healthcare, government and private payers and providers are introducing value-based care models. In value-based models, providers assume increased levels of clinical and financial responsibility for patient outcomes, instead of being reimbursed strictly based on the quantity of services provided. We believe that healthcare platforms that efficiently assist healthcare stakeholders to transition to these value-based models will be best positioned to capture this opportunity.
Challenges associated with the adoption of value-based models
The healthcare continuum can be viewed as an aggregation of three distinct domains:

• | The knowledge domain, including academic centers, scientific institutions and companies that discover and commercialize medical and scientific knowledge;


• | The care delivery domain, including hospitals, community practices, physicians and other constituents that deliver healthcare to patients; and


• | The payer domain, including insurers, governments and self-insured employers that administer and provide funding to the healthcare system.

The disparate and fragmented nature of these domains and economic incentives under traditional fee-for-service models frequently result in overtreatment, high costs and suboptimal patient outcomes. Fee-for-service models are as a general matter inherently site-centric, volume driven, reactive in nature and uncoordinated. In contrast, value-based models are generally more patient-centric, outcomes-focused, proactive and coordinated across the care continuum.
Despite a clear need, the design and implementation of next-generation interoperable systems has been limited due to reliance on legacy, site-specific, fee-for-service technology systems and infrastructure. Since the passage of the HITECH Act in 2009, providers and payers have made significant investments in EHRs, and other technologies meant to enable the transition to value-based care. Despite extensive investment and coordination, the introduction of value-based models has been limited due to the shortcomings of legacy, proprietary systems and the reliance on unstructured data that hinders interoperability and cannot be sufficiently shared or manipulated to produce actionable findings. Value-based models require collection and analysis of longitudinal treatment, outcomes and financial data at the patient level, regardless of treatment site. Critically, these systems must also securely safeguard patient data in compliance with stringent HIPAA and other privacy regulations. We believe that there is a significant need for interoperability platforms that dynamically access, normalize, integrate and update information from disparate sources across the healthcare continuum in real time. Secure interoperability platforms can allow for more comprehensive solutions development that proactively connect, deliver business and clinical intelligence and enable enhanced provider and patient engagement.
A paradigm shift to molecularly precise and real-time biometric-driven medicine, with both massive volumes and rapidly expanding categories of complex data from traditional and novel sources.
The collection and interpretation of molecular profiles and near real-time biometric monitoring has the potential to dramatically improve quality and outcomes.
Evolution to comprehensive molecular analysis
Advances in sequencing over the last 15 years and the associated cost efficiencies have led to the development of targeted therapeutics initiating the transformation from “one size fits all” treatments to personalized, molecularly precise medicine. Single marker and gene panel diagnostic tests have now advanced from the research to clinical care settings. Oncology is leading the rapid advances in molecular testing and the development of targeted therapeutics based on increasing understanding of the impact of molecular profile on disease progression. Recent publications, including The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network genomic and molecular characterization studies, support selection of treatment regimens based on the underlying molecular pathways and related genomic alterations in the genetic profile of the tumor compared with the patient’s own germline, as opposed to the anatomical location of the cancer in the patient’s body. Cancer is increasingly understood to be a heterogeneous collection of rare diseases, with hundreds of patient-specific, cancer-promoting mutated proteins, some known and many more unknown, called neoepitopes. Identifying and targeting these mutated proteins is requiring more comprehensive genomic and proteomic analysis, which is increasingly becoming embedded in drug approvals. As a result, we believe comprehensive genomic and proteomic analysis is positioned to become the standard of clinical care, replacing single marker or gene panels in treating cancer patients.
- 7 -

Oncology has been an early adopter of precision medicine due to the cost as well as inconsistent and often poor clinical outcomes associated with many traditional “trial-and-error” treatment regimens. While oncology represents the most immediate opportunity, we believe other disease areas are beginning to experience a similar evolution, with immune-related diseases, central nervous system disorders and transplants having a high potential for adoption of personalized medicine. We believe technologies that enable the capture, aggregation and analysis of massive volumes of genomic data will further bolster the growth of precision medicine and its expansion from cancer to additional disease states. Over time, we believe this will lead to identification of drugs that target specific pathways by using a universal personalized companion diagnostics platform, ultimately resulting in improved clinical outcomes.
Limitations of the existing single marker and gene panel approach
The human genome is comprised of approximately 20,000 genes and 3 billion DNA base pairs. Until recently, scientists have focused on less than 2% of the genome that is responsible for coding proteins. As a result, most diagnostic tests today only analyze specific genes, or gene panels, exploring only a fraction of the human genome, while incorporating “a priori” assumptions that capture only a subset of the most common gene alterations. These alterations are calculated relative to a reference genome of a population instead of a patient’s own healthy tissue, or germline. Gene panels that utilize a reference genome often fail to capture key, medically actionable mutations or incorrectly highlight mutations present in both the germline and cancer tissue. Analyses that exclude whole genome sequencing, RNA analysis and comparisons to an individual’s germline instead of a reference genome can lead to materially false positive and false negative results. A more comprehensive molecular analysis would allow providers to develop personalized treatment regimens, replacing existing costly “trial-and-error” approaches to treatment. A comprehensive molecular analysis, including both germline and cancer tissue, would make no assumptions as to the molecular driver of the patient’s disease and would capture mutations that are commonly missed by gene panels.
Challenges associated with the adoption of comprehensive molecular analysis
Comprehensive molecular analysis combines whole genome-to-germline comparison and RNA expression as confirmation of the presence of variants. Comprehensive molecular analysis has been difficult to perform in a practical, timely and cost-effective manner because it has long run times to complete sequencing, creates hundreds of gigabytes of complex data per patient, which must be transported, stored and analyzed with supercomputing and/or high-performance computing environments in a clinically relevant period of time, and requires large capital investments required to perform sequencing at scale. Furthermore, the absence of adaptive machine learning algorithms to enable efficient medical interpretation and effective expression analysis has inhibited the ability to derive value from the massive amount of data produced by comprehensive molecular analysis. Accordingly, comprehensive molecular analysis has primarily been utilized in the academic and research settings, and not in the clinical setting to inform treatment decisions. Finally, there have been insurance coverage and reimbursement challenges for comprehensive molecular analysis solutions, limiting their adoption.
Increasing proliferation and importance of real-time biometric data and its adoption in hospitals and other patient care settings
Several trends are contributing to the rising importance and availability of biometric data, including the increasing prevalence of connected devices in multiple care settings and the opportunity for proactive patient interventions to improve health outcomes. As hospital systems implement EHRs, they have installed hardware and software solutions to connect medical devices to collect periodic sampling of key patient metrics such as respiratory rate, blood pressure and heart rate. Providers have expanded these technologies into other care settings, including skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, outpatient facilities and patients’ homes. Concurrently, with the advent of connected devices, activity monitors and remote patient monitoring devices are achieving widespread adoption, allowing for the increased quantification of key biometric signals. Healthcare professionals have the potential to gain a more comprehensive view of an individual’s health on a real-time basis across care settings through increased adoption of patient monitoring devices. The increased availability of quantifiable biometric data allows for the implementation of decision support tools and proactive treatment interventions, potentially utilizing care pathways and learning algorithms to improve care outcomes.
Challenges associated with leveraging quantifiable, real-time biometric analysis in multiple care settings
An increasing amount of biometric data is being generated by the proliferation of connected devices. However, complexities associated with synthesizing this data into actionable insights remain an obstacle. Although many hospital-based medical devices can continuously stream data to an EHR, frequently the EHR can only accept periodic data, potentially missing a critically relevant patient episode. There is also a lack of comprehensive solutions that support physician decision-making in real time. The absence of effective data interpretation supported by adaptive machine learning or other algorithms is evidenced by “alarm fatigue” among many healthcare providers (a condition that can occur when one is exposed to many frequent alarms or alters and consequently becomes desensitized to them) as they struggle to establish optimal event thresholds.

Growth in complexity and its promise for value-based models
Advances in molecular medicine and real-time biometrics require healthcare providers to promptly aggregate, evaluate and synthesize hundreds to thousands of relevant facts to arrive at a single patient decision. With the enormous complexity of genomics and expression analysis derived from comprehensive molecular analysis, the pace of medical advancements, and the significant amount of data being created every day by patient care, payment and regulatory compliance systems, it is nearly impossible for a practicing physician to interpret and synthesize the deluge of complex information required for patient treatment.
We believe there is a considerable need for advanced adaptive machine learning algorithms to collect, index and analyze rich biometric, phenotypic, genomic and proteomic data at scale to support physician decision-making. Although this complexity creates significant challenges, it also presents opportunities for developers of systems infrastructures, platforms and learning systems that can identify clinically meaningful correlations that can be employed to improve patient outcomes in a cost-effective manner.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe the increasing focus on value-based reimbursement models and evidence-based, personalized medicine will drive validation and adoption of NantHealth solutions. Recent statistics show that 38% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, resulting in an estimated cost of $174 billion by 2020. Additionally, we see the precision medicine market growing substantially as comprehensive diagnostics and evidence-based medicine become increasingly important across multiple disease areas and likely assuming greater share of the combined biopharmaceutical and diagnostics markets. We believe several factors support adoption of our universal molecular analysis solutions GPS Cancer and Liquid GPS, which enables an increased understanding of molecular pathways and their targets, such as:

• | Improved pharmacoeconomics, including the use of more cost-effective drugs approved for other indications (such as asthma and diabetes) in cancer treatment regimens;


• | A clearer understanding of critical drug resistance information;


• | Increased adoption of bundled payments as providers and payers recognize the efficiency of optimized therapies; and


• | Increased awareness and published clinical results demonstrating the benefits of evidence-based molecular medicine.

We believe the potential addressable market for NantHealth solutions will continue to grow in relation to the market-share gains of value-based models and the adoption of precision medicine.
NantHealth Solutions
Our NantHealth solutions comprise a highly differentiated, integrated model for the delivery of healthcare, comprised of our unique molecular profiling solutions, software, and hardware systems infrastructure, which integrates patient data management, bioinformatics, and molecular medicine, enabling value-based care and evidence-based clinical practice. Our platform and our multi-domain solutions are designed to address some of the most pressing cross-domain challenges across the healthcare continuum. Our solutions are single-domain and cross-domain offerings that can be applied, for example, within a hospital system or for a hospital system and a commercial insurance provider in an Accountable Care Organization, or ACO, crossing multiple domains. We believe unique systems-based approach positions us (i) to deliver 21st century molecular and biometric signature-driven precision medicine and potentially change the current paradigm of uncoordinated healthcare and (ii) as a next-generation payer intermediary who facilitates payment for value.

• | Cancer Care Solutions. Our comprehensive set of interoperability, advanced molecular analysis, risk stratification and decision support solutions (Eviti) can enable our clients to improve decision-making and coordinate care across the healthcare continuum. Our GPS Cancer molecular profiling solution is the only comprehensive and commercially available molecular profiling solution that integrates whole genome (comparing both a patient’s normal and tumor tissue), RNA and molecular pathways information into a clinical report that analyzes this data and identifies actionable targets and potential clinical treatment options. Liquid GPS is NantHealth’s blood-based molecular test that provides oncologists with a powerful tool for noninvasive tumor profiling and quantitative monitoring of treatment response. Liquid GPS looks beyond cfDNA to cfRNA, which allows profiling and trending of actionable biomarkers that cannot be assessed through cfDNA alone. In addition to providing molecular insight into key guidelines-based biomarkers (e.g., EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS), this powerful RNA-based approach enables a variety of capabilities and applications not typically available from a liquid biopsy test.

• | Provider Solutions. Our provider solution software, comprised of an integration of our various solutions, including DeviceConX, VitalsConX and NaviNet, leverage the data available on our systems infrastructure to enable patient-centered engagement and coordination across care locations. Our NantHealth software solutions include real-time vitals connectivity, and clinical and administrative workflows including eligibility and benefits, claims, referral and readmissions management solutions. Our device connectivity modules and flexible applications analyze and interpret patient and provider-specific information and can deliver critical clinical and administrative insights.


• | Payer Solutions. Our NantHealth payer software solutions establish daily access to the clinical practice and caregiver and leverage the data available on our systems infrastructure to facilitate payment for value. We believe our position between the payer and the provider allows us to align incentives as a next-generation payer intermediary, to help payers ensure consistent evidence-based treatment pathways and to accelerate pre-adjudication and lower administrative overhead for providers. This can ultimately drive quality of care and streamline workflows while improving control over the administrative and operating costs associated with eligibility and benefits, claims processing, referrals, authorizations, document exchange and review utilization. Our multi-payer collaboration solution, NaviNet Open, offers provider end users a uniform set of workflows and services across many or all the payers with whom they routinely collaborate. This multipayer experience benefits payers and providers alike. Providers can benefit from a uniform experience and toolset across multiple payer relationships, and the payer can benefit from the uniform application of best practices, tools, and options, as well as the reduction in costly errors and phone-based interactions that can stem from a non-uniform end-user experience.

We designed our NantHealth solutions to enable providers, payers, pharma and self-insured employers to overcome challenges encountered across the knowledge, care delivery, and payer domains within the healthcare continuum.
We are a leading vendor of payer-provider collaboration solutions (NaviNet Open), with a national provider network of approximately 870,000 active user accounts on the NaviNet platform across all 50 states.
In this Annual Report, “active user account” means a NaviNet Open user account for which the applicable user has established or reset their permanent password in the previous 120 days.
Our Systems Infrastructure
Our unique interoperable systems infrastructure has been built over the last decade to address the knowledge, care delivery and payer domains. As of December 31, 2018, our NantHealth solutions or their components have been widely adopted, processing nearly 50 million payer-provider transactions per month with approximately 853,000 active user accounts nationwide. 
 NantHealth's systems-based approach enables the near real-time transfer and clinical translation of genomic analysis, biometric signal data and actionable information to the care delivery domain, with access to a HIPAA-compliant cloud, providing the coordination of reimbursement between the care delivery domain and the payer domain.
Our Systems Infrastructure is comprised of:

• | Access to next-generation genomic analysis technologies with near real-time bioinformatics, provided as part of GPS Cancer through our affiliate, NantOmics, and as part of our own Liquid GPS test;


• | Access to a secure HIPAA-compliant cloud environment; and


• | Device connectivity in over 390 client sites, active hospitals/facilities, to what we estimate to be approximately 41,000 medical devices and collecting over 15.4 billion vital signals annually with the ability to connect to over 500 medical device models.

Our access to CAP- and CLIA-certified sequencing capability, coupled with supercomputer environments, enables us to deliver comprehensive genomic analysis. We have established a HIPAA-compliant, secure and scalable cloud computing, storage and transport infrastructure capable of processing, storing and transporting petabytes of diverse, protected patient data. Our device connectivity and near real-time biometric monitoring software and hardware solutions allow us to aggregate data through the open architecture platform, from one of the largest libraries of in-hospital and remote medical devices and wearables on the market. Our cloud-based NantHealth software solutions accesses, integrates and updates information from disparate clinical, operational and financial systems to create a dynamic and actionable dataset. This framework enables us, our clients and third-party partners to develop an integrated ecosystem of compatible applications.
- 10 -

We believe other organizations have not yet been able to integrate these components in a similarly near real-time and continuous manner, and this personalized, evidence-based molecular approach, combined with our NantHealth solutions, significantly differentiates us from our competitors. In addition, third parties may use our solutions to deliver drugs to patients in a more predictive, preventative and evidence-based manner, potentially improving patient outcomes and pharmacoeconomics.
Product Overviews
Precision Insights
NantHealth’s GPS Precision Insights molecular profiling provides comprehensive DNA, RNA, Tumor and Normal Analysis combined with pharmacogenomics data. Each patient’s molecular analysis is evaluated for applicability to evidence-based therapies advancing the promise of precision medicine while retaining the values of standard of care practice. NantHealth’s Liquid GPS cfDNA and cfRNA platforms provide non-invasive insights into therapeutic selection of targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.
GPS Cancer:
GPS Cancer is a comprehensive molecular profile that integrates whole genome (DNA) sequencing of tumor and normal germline samples and whole transcriptome (RNA) sequencing, providing oncologists with insights into the unique molecular signature of a patient’s cancer to inform personalized treatment strategies. The results of the GPS Cancer profile can provide oncologists with insight into cancer therapies that may have potential benefit - including active clinical trials - and those therapies to which the cancer may be resistant. GPS Cancer profiling is conducted in CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratories.
GPS Cancer compares a total of 6 billion DNA base pairs between a patient’s healthy normal (or germline) sample and the tumor sample (usually Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded-FFPE or fresh frozen tissue) each encoding for over 20,000 genes. All the RNA (over 200,000 transcripts) from the tumor sample is sequenced to confirm and give evidence of expression of mutations found in the genome. We identify affected molecular pathways that are drivers of a patient’s cancer by analyzing DNA and RNA sequence data against our curated database of over 15,000 nodes within approximately 1,500 protein pathways.
- 11 -

Cancer is increasingly understood to be a heterogeneous collection of rare diseases. As such, understanding genomic alterations in tumor samples can help to identify potential treatment options for the personalized management of people with cancer. 
Whole genome sequencing of a person’s tumor sample against their normal sample highlights molecular alterations that are specific to their tumor DNA, and RNA sequencing subsequently confirms the alterations identified in the DNA of a person’s tumor. Whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing can provide vital clinical information about individual molecular alterations in tumors that result in abnormal proteins, which can be important targets for many cancer therapies.
GPS Cancer identifies genomic alterations with high clinical relevance to each person’s tumor. The alterations are then matched to drugs that might be effective against tumors containing the specific change. By identifying the totality of alterations from whole genome sequencing, honing in on alterations that are associated with protein expression from RNA sequencing, a more accurate and comprehensive molecular profile is assembled that can inform the therapeutic options available to oncology care providers and their patients.
By enabling informed therapy selection and utilization, GPS Cancer brings various opportunities to impact both cost and quality of care for individuals with cancer, such as:

• | Avoiding ineffective therapy usage: By providing molecular insight into sensitivity or resistance to specific drugs, GPS Cancer may help oncologists identify regimens that are unlikely to benefit the patient. This insight may help avoid use of high-cost therapies that are unlikely to help the patient.


• | Decreasing treatment cycles through improved therapy selection: Therapies selected based on molecular evidence of likely benefit may require fewer cycles to achieve response.


• | Increasing clinical trial participation: For many advanced cancers, standard-of-care drug options are quickly exhausted, and clinical trials represent a source of additional options for patients. GPS Cancer helps identify trials that may be applicable to the patient based on their tumor’s molecular profile.

For example, according to a presentation at ASCO 2015, it was estimated that a typical patient receiving a combination therapy of two checkpoint inhibitors, one anti-PD-1 agent and one anti-CTLA-4 agent, would cost approximately $300,000 with approximately $60,000 being the patient’s out-of-pocket cost (assuming a 20% copay). Applying this figure to the nearly 600,000 patients dying from metastatic cancer annually (no adjuvant therapy), the treatment would cost society nearly $174 billion annually. Studies suggest that cancer therapeutics such as immune checkpoint inhibitors are more effective when there is a high neoantigen and nonsynonymous mutation (i.e., results in a change in the amino acid sequence) burden in the tumor. We have presented our data at ASCO 2018 which we believe shows that GPS Cancer is superior to other panel tests in accurately measuring tumor mutation burden. We believe GPS Cancer’s ability to identify mutation burden and neoepitopes through its comprehensive omics analysis will serve as a critical and novel source for both pre-treatment efficacy analysis and individualized immunotherapies for cancer patients.

GPS Cancer Report
Our GPS Cancer solution further leverages novel adaptive machine learning algorithms that match the identified alterations to an extensive and evolving library of signaling pathways, drugs and drug targets, regardless of indication, to provide predictive analyses that can enable the physician to make decisions regarding the potential efficacy of personalized therapies, as well as points of resistance. GPS Cancer results are available to the ordering physician in a concise report. While the GPS Cancer report does not recommend treatments, it can enable the treating physician to develop a personalized treatment plan after discussing with the patient the available treatment options and the potential risks associated with each treatment option. The GPS Cancer report can be utilized by the physician in several ways. The report may:

• | List targets based on DNA/RNA analysis that may be treated by FDA-approved drugs either in an on-label or off-label manner based on peer-reviewed clinical data;


• | List findings that suggest a particular targeted therapy which the physician would otherwise use may not work due to a potential resistance marker;


• | Provide information on key biomarkers that inform the use of immunotherapy, including PD-L1, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability (MSI);


• | Provide information on key pharmacogenomic markers of chemotherapy drug toxicity and thromboembolic risk;


• | Provide the information necessary for the physician to decide whether it is appropriate to place the patient in a clinical trial; and


• | Provide key information based on germline sequencing, including germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes and confirmation of provenance - i.e., that the tumor being tested comes from the intended patient.

Pharmacogenomics
Our GPS Cancer test results includes information on a patient’s pharmacogenomic profile to provide insight on germline alterations implicated in increased toxicity or altered metabolism of anti-cancer drugs. This information is presented in a patient’s GPS Cancer test report.
Specifically, we have added an analysis of eight pharmacogenomic genes, CYP2d6, CYP3A5, DPYD, F5, G6PD, NUDT15, TPMT, and UGT1A1, and their associations with the following drugs: Azathioprine, Belinostat, Capecitabine, Dabrafenib, Eltrombopag olamine, Fluorouracil, Irinotecan, Mercaptopurine, Nilotinib, Pazopanib, Rasburicase, Tacrolimus, Tamoxifen, Tegafur, and Thioguanine. Sources used for pharmacogenomic implications include prescribing information, primary scientific literature, and guidelines published by the Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium (CPIC, see www.cpicpgx.org). In addition, the F5 (Factor V) gene is screened for the Leiden variant that confers increased risk of thromboembolic events.
Insurance Coverage
We announced our first coverage/reimbursement contract for GPS Cancer with a large health plan in January 2016, which represented the nation’s first such insurance coverage for a whole genome molecular analysis platform. Subsequently, we have signed contracts for the reimbursement of GPS Cancer by additional health insurance plans (including plans covering various city employees in multiple states) and self-insured employer groups (including a large employer with a national footprint). We believe reimbursement arrangements with health insurance plans and self-insured employers will continue to grow.
Competitive Advantage of GPS Cancer’s Comprehensive Molecular Analysis Capabilities
Current approaches to enabling precision cancer care have various limitations described below. GPS Cancer is specifically designed to help oncologists overcome these challenges.
Clinical challenge #1: DNA-only, tumor-only gene panels (i.e., without tumor-germline comparison) may result in inaccurate mutation calls in druggable targets.
GPS Cancer includes:

• | RNA sequencing to confirm DNA alterations that may result in expression of abnormal proteins; and


• | Tumor-germline comparison to (1) help avoid inappropriate therapies due to misinterpretation of inherited mutations as somatic and (2) confirm provenance - i.e., that the tumor being tested comes from that patient.

- 13 -

Many of the current gene panels on the market are limited to only a small fraction of the genome and fail to cover the full molecular profile of a patient’s tumor. Because these panels measure less than 2% of the approximately 20,000 genes and less than 0.04% of the entire genome, the results may be fraught with a significant number of false negatives, potentially leading to erroneous clinical decisions. Furthermore, many gene panel tests fail to directly compare the patient’s tumor to the patient’s normal (or germline) genome, potentially leading to false positives by suggesting a mutation is in the cancer alone when it is really a normal variant.
Unlike most commercially available genomic tests, which are based on interrogation of predefined alterations in only a small fraction of the genome, GPS Cancer is based on whole genome sequencing (of tumor and normal samples), and RNA sequencing. GPS Cancer compares 6 billion DNA base pairs (tumor and normal), sequences 200,000 RNA transcripts and provides analysis for over 15,000 nodes within approximately 1,500 protein pathways.
The importance of this precise and comprehensive approach has been increasingly emphasized by a growing body of evidence.
In 2015, Johns Hopkins released a study identifying the limitations of tumor-only sequencing, concluding that “a tumor-only sequencing approach could not definitively identify germline changes in cancer-predisposing genes and led to additional false-positive findings comprising 31% and 65% of alterations identified in targeted and exome analyses, respectively, including in potentially actionable genes. These data suggest that matched tumor-normal sequencing analyses are essential for precise identification and interpretation of somatic and germline alterations and have important implications for the diagnostic and therapeutic management of cancer patients.”
The limitations of DNA-only molecular testing were revealed in 2015, where data were presented on 3,783 patients at the 2015 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, entitled “Genomics, Transcriptomics, and Proteomics in the Clinical Setting: Integrating Whole Genome and RNA Sequencing with Quantitative Proteomics to Better Inform Clinical Treatment Selection” showed that only a small number of altered DNA actually resulted in increased expression of a given actionable gene. In many instances, increased expression of an actionable gene could not be traced back to an alteration in the DNA. In a largest proportion of positive mutation calls as determined by the gene panel, no increased RNA expression occurred, thus potentially resulting in a false positive gene panel reading.
Further evidence was presented at ASCO 2018, entitled “Seventeen percent of NGS 50 gene panel variants are not expressed in RNAseq” which showed that in a standard 50 gene clinical gene panel (Oncomine V1) of commonly altered genes in cancer, approximately 17% of variants are not expressed in the RNA. Epigenetic silencing can occur for many reasons and this is not evaluated by standard DNA-only tests.

GPS Cancer is the only comprehensive and commercially available clinical cancer platform incorporating and integrating whole genome (comparing both a patient’s normal and tumor tissue), RNA and molecular pathways information into a clinical report that analyzes this data and identifies actionable targets to inform clinical treatment decisions.
GPS in Rare Diseases and Chronic Illnesses
Although we are deploying GPS initially for cancer, we believe this solution has potential application in identifying molecular profiles and germline mutations in rare diseases and chronic illnesses. Our molecular profile solutions have been used by a large academic research institution to examine the genomic familial drivers of cardiac disease and to perform additional research in ALS, obesity, suicide and diabetes, among other diseases.
GPS Cancer: Proprietary Methods and Software
Patents with claims related to GPS Cancer are issued or allowed in the United States and internationally, and GPS Cancer is the subject of several U.S. and foreign patent applications. The proprietary methods and software components underlying GPS Cancer include:

• | Liquid Tissue. Extracts lysates from FFPE tissue using proprietary methods to examine tumor-normal proteins and genomes.


• | Transporter Software. Securely transfers unassembled data from sequencing instruments to the analytical custom-designed supercomputing environment.


• | Contraster Software. Rapidly identifies genomic variants in a patient’s tumor samples and compares it to that patient’s germline or proprietary database of disease associated genes.


• | Paradigm Software. Integrates DNA sequencing data from the contraster software with RNA sequencing data to identify alterations in cellular signaling behavior that are driving disease progression. The algorithm matches the alterations to the library of all known signaling pathways and all drugs and drug targets, irrespective of indication, to potentially help predict the effectiveness of personalized therapies and points of resistance.

Liquid GPS
Liquid GPS is NantHealth’s blood-based molecular test that provides oncologists with a powerful tool for noninvasive tumor profiling and quantitative monitoring of treatment response. Liquid GPS looks beyond cfDNA to cfRNA, which allows profiling and trending of actionable biomarkers that cannot be assessed through cfDNA alone. In addition to providing molecular insight into key guidelines-based biomarkers (e.g., EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS), this powerful RNA-based approach enables a variety of capabilities and applications not typically available from a liquid biopsy test
Key Applications
Targeted therapy monitoring
 In addition to assessing guideline-recommended mutations (e.g., EGFR, BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS), Liquid GPS provides cfRNA-based testing and monitoring for gene fusions and translocations (i.e., ALK, ROS1). RNA has also been shown to be a more accurate indicator of fusions and translocations compared to DNA, which can miss or incorrectly classify gene fusions.

Immunotherapy monitoring
With immunotherapy increasingly becoming a central component of care in many cancers, molecular tools are evolving to give oncologists new and earlier insights into their effectiveness in each patient. Liquid GPS includes 4 analytes associated with approved and investigational immunotherapies - PDL1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and TIM-3. PD-L1 via Liquid GPS’s cfRNA analysis has been demonstrated to correlate to measurement by IHC. Not only can this information inform an oncologist’s initial treatment selection, it can also be used to monitor response over time. In fact, blood-based PD-L1 assessment has been shown to objectively differentiate between true progression and pseudoprogression, which may help to avoid erroneously changing treatment due to pseudoprogression.
Chemotherapy monitoring
Liquid GPS includes 11 analytes associated with response or resistance to commonly used chemotherapies, including ERCC1 to inform use of platinums and TUBB3 to inform use of taxanes.
Define Right Treatment Before Treatment Begins (Eviti):
The rapid advancement of molecular and biometric medicine is overwhelming many physicians’ cognitive ability, while uncoordinated, non-evidence-based treatment pathways are increasing costs and reducing the quality of care. 
Within our oncology solutions, Eviti, our decision support solution, provides evidence-based clinical decision support, which is a critical element to ensure optimal treatment regimens. Eviti is a SaaS-based clinical decision support solution that centralizes clinical content, treatment cost data from Medicare reimbursements and treatment toxicity data. The clinical content is curated by our dedicated team of clinicians, including oncologists and nurses, who convert published literature and clinical trials into structured information that can be used for decision support. The Eviti Advisor product is an overlay on this platform and allows physicians to access this data to better inform treatment decisions. Thus, physicians can readily stay abreast of the latest advances in cancer care.
Eviti provides value to our clients through its access to over 7,200 federally-registered clinical trials updated weekly and over 3,500 evidence-based treatment regimens for the treatment of cancer arising from over 40 different anatomical locations. Unique to the care delivery domain, physicians also benefit from improved claim processing by using our Eviti platform that issues a pre-authorization “Eviti code” when the physician chooses an approved evidence-based clinical pathway, thereby validating appropriate treatment and pre-adjudicating the claim. This is an important step in that payers and providers are collaborating on high-value, evidence-based clinical pathways as opposed to non-value-added reimbursements and denials of payments.
Eviti is typically sold to health plans on a per member (or life) per month basis. These health plans sponsor the solution and provide Eviti free of charge to oncologists and their staffs. 
The snapshot of our system below illustrates how different cancer treatment options for a patient is presented to compare treatments across a variety of metrics, including expected treatment outcome, plan compliance and costs. By providing the oncologist with this comparison, we believe Eviti drives compliance and a greater number of treatments to be in accordance with evidence-based pathways.

In May 2015, we and Allscripts Healthcare, LLC, or Allscripts Healthcare, an affiliate of Allscripts, entered into a mutual license and reseller agreement, or the Mutual License and Reseller Agreement, which was subsequently amended and restated in June 2015, pursuant to which we each appointed the other as a non-exclusive marketer and reseller to eligible, approved customers of various products and services, including our DeviceConX, VitalxConX, HBox, Device Escort and Eviti Advisor products and services and Allscripts Healthcare’s FollowMyHealth, Care Director, EPSi and dbMotion products and services. In addition, we and Allscripts Healthcare each designated the other as a preferred partner-i.e., subject to certain exceptions and limitations, our DeviceConX family of products and services are the exclusive medical device integration products and services that may be marketed and sold by Allscripts Healthcare, and Allscripts Healthcare’s scheduled products and services are the exclusive products and services of the same required functionality that may be marketed and sold by us. Each party retained ownership of any data generated and collected in connection with its respective products, though each party granted the other a non-exclusive, fully paid-up license to use its data, as well as to use its trademarks, marketing materials and product documentation in connection with the marketing and resale of products and services. The agreement has an initial term of five (5) years and renews automatically for successive one (1) year periods, unless terminated by us or Allscripts Healthcare. Each party has the right to terminate the agreement in the event the other party commits a material, uncured breach, is declared insolvent, suffers a prolonged force majeure event, becomes ineligible for federal healthcare programming or undergoes a change-in-control involving such party’s competitor. In June 2015, Allscripts purchased a 10% equity stake in our company for $200.0 million in cash. In addition, NantCapital, LLC, or NantCapital, announced a $100.0 million investment into Allscripts. NantCapital’s investment was executed through a private placement of Allscripts common stock. The investments and commercial agreement strengthened the partnership between Allscripts and our company, originally announced in March 2015, to develop an integrated, evidence-based, personalized approach to healthcare solutions, and specifically cancer care. We plan to use Allscripts’ scale, global network of hospital and physician clients and leading software solutions, combined with our clinical platform, applications and connectivity devices to build out the infrastructure for new personalized, precision medicine programs for our clients to improve cancer care. Together, our goal is for physicians and patients to have the tools to stay engaged and active and provide the necessary intervention as early as possible. On August 3, 2017, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., pursuant to which we agreed to sell to Allscripts substantially all of the assets of the company’s provider/patient engagement solutions business, including our FusionFX solution and components of its NantOS software connectivity solutions. The sale was completed on August 25, 2017. Concurrent with the sale to AllScripts and as contemplated by the asset purchase agreement, we and Allscripts modified the amended and restated mutual license and reseller agreement dated June 26, 2015, which was further amended on December 30, 2017, such that, among other things, we committed to deliver a minimum of $95.0 million of total bookings over a ten-year period (“Bookings Commitment”) from referral transactions and sales of certain Allscripts products under this agreement. In the event of a Bookings Commitment shortfall at the end of the ten-year period, we may be obligated to pay 70% of the shortfall, subject to certain credits. We will earn 30% commission from Allscripts on each software referral transaction that results in a booking with Allscripts. We account for the Bookings Commitment at its estimated fair value over the life of the agreement and, as of December 31, 2018, we estimate it to be $16.9 million.
Our Clients
NantHealth solutions and technology platforms are used by key healthcare stakeholders, including healthcare providers, payers, self-insured employers, academic institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. NantHealth solutions, coupled with our engagement methodology, is designed to be tailored to meet the large-scale needs of governmental organizations and private entities while remaining convenient, intuitive and configurable at the user level. We believe that this provides us with a significant advantage over a siloed, single vendor approach, which often requires the removal or replacement of existing information technology infrastructure and applications. While historically many of our solutions have been consumed on a stand-alone basis, we are increasingly bundling our solutions as our clients look for comprehensive approaches that leverage our learning algorithms.

Our total revenue was $89.5 million and $86.7 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, three customers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, two customers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales organization is primarily comprised of direct sales executives and pre-sales support teams organized by account type and domain and subject matter expertise. We also leverage strategic reseller arrangements and a channel relationship coverage team.

• | Direct sales organization: We leverage domain and subject matter expertise, market credibility, thought leadership, and relationships of our executives, senior management, and product leaders in our sales efforts. Our direct sales organization is divided into two focused teams, one dedicated to commercializing our GPS Cancer solution, and the other focused on NantHealth’s health information technology solutions portfolio. These two primary direct coverage teams include both sales professionals searching for new accounts and client engagement sales professionals responsible for developing existing accounts. Furthermore, sales professionals have unique expertise and specialized coverage for health plans, self-insured employers, health systems, and individual providers. Our account management organization is responsible for the continuity of current client relationships and the expansion of those relationships to include additional solutions and services.

We have a pre-sales organization that includes clinical, business and technical customer alignment teams to support our sales organization in addition to executive sponsorship with members of our senior management team.

• | Resale and channel partnership: In the United States, we have entered strategic resale arrangements with major partners, including EHR vendors (including Allscripts), in-hospital medical devices manufacturers and health plans who resell our solutions to their customer base. Internationally, we have entered resale arrangements with other strategic distributors to accelerate our market adoption. Reseller revenue in 2018 and 2017 was $14.5 million and $14.8 million, respectively.

We also maintain business relationships with individuals and organizations that promote or support our sales or services. We refer to these individuals and organizations as our channel partners. These channel partners generally do not make sales directly like our resale partners, but instead provide us with leads that we use to develop new business through our direct sales force. These relationships enable access to broader hospital and physician clients, leading software solutions and multiple cross-selling opportunities.
We complement our sales efforts with a marketing organization that plans and execute marketing and communication strategies that are centered on initiatives that drive awareness of our company and solutions. These initiatives include educating the market about our company broadly, as well as solutions-specific campaigns for lead generation. Marketing efforts also include participation in speaking engagements and strategic interfacing with key business and trade media personnel. We employ a broad array of specific events to facilitate these initiatives, including, but not limited to, sponsorship and partnership of key industry conferences such as HIMSS and or ASCO, events and client-focused programs such as key partner user groups.
Our sales cycle can vary significantly and typically ranges from 6 months to 18 months from initial contact to contract execution. The sales cycle significantly differs based on the domain, type of solution and size of the client. Implementation, training and professional services are normally rendered based on a mutually agreed upon timetable.
Competition
The competitive landscape is highly fragmented, and to our knowledge, no single competitor currently offers similarly expansive capabilities and solution offerings in comprehensive molecular analysis, software, and systems infrastructure, particularly with a focus on creating a learning system. Our primary competitors can be characterized by the following categories of companies that provide capabilities or solutions that compete with one or more of our platforms or solutions:

• | Molecular analysis vendors, such as Caris Life Sciences, Inc., Foundation Medicine, Inc., Guardant Health, Inc., Paradigm Diagnostics, Inc., Personal Genome Diagnostics, Inc. and Tempus Labs;


• | Payer-provider collaboration vendors, such as Availity, LLC, Change Healthcare, Inc. (formerly Emdeon), Experian Information Solutions, Inc. (including its Passport division), Healthx, Inc. and Health Trio, LlC;

- 21 -


• | Medical device data system and device connectivity vendors, such as Capsule Technologies, Inc. (formerly Qualcomm Life), Cerner Corporation, Bernoulli Enterprise, Inc., General Electric Company and Medical Information Technology, Inc.; and


• | Healthcare information technology decision support vendors such as The Advisory Board Company, Castlight Health, Inc., or Castlight Health, Evolent Health, eviCore Healthcare, HealthCatalyst, Inc., or HealthCatalyst, International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, Inovalon Holdings, Inc., or Inovalon and Truven Health Analytics, or Truven (acquired by IBM).

The principal competitive factors in our industry include:

• | Breadth and depth of application functionality;


• | Ease of use and performance;


• | Network strength and level of user adoption;


• | Client testimonials and recommendations;


• | Breadth of client base;


• | Cloud-based delivery model;


• | Competitive and understandable pricing;


• | Ability to deliver actionable information in a relevant time period;


• | Size and scope of payer clinical policy knowledge;


• | Sale and marketing capabilities of vendor;


• | Financial stability of vendor;


• | Ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications; and


• | Ability to innovate and respond rapidly to client needs and regulatory changes.

We believe we will compete favorably despite competing against a broad, diverse set of businesses and with increasing competition as other established and emerging companies enter our industry, client requirements evolve, and new products and technologies are introduced. Moreover, some of our actual and potential competitors have certain advantages over us, such as greater financial, technical, marketing, research and development and other resources, stronger brand and business user recognition, larger installed customer bases, larger intellectual property portfolios and broader global distribution and presence.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts consist primarily of new product research and development, significant product improvements, the development of our knowledge base, the development of our online tools, such as our online portal and mobile applications, and the improvement and augmentation of our learning system.
Our ability to compete and attract new clients depends, in large part, on our continuous commitment to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features, and functionality. Our research and development team is responsible for the design and development of our applications and software tools. We follow state-of-the-art practices in software development using modern programming languages, data storage systems, and other tools.
Research and development expenses decreased $12.9 million or 38.2%, from $33.9 million in 2017 to $20.9 million in 2018. This decrease was largely driven by a decrease of $8.4 million in personnel expenses due to our restructuring in 2017, offset by the addition of research and development personnel from NantHealth Labs, which reduced headcount allocated to research and development by around 26%. There was also a $2.7 million decrease in stock compensation related to the reduction in research and development headcount, and an equity award granted in November 2017, a portion of which vested immediately increasing the expense recognized for 2017. The lower headcount and lower overall bonus payments in 2018 led to a $0.5 million decrease in bonus expense. Also, we saw a $0.7 million decline in expense from external research and development resources as development projects were performed internally.
We expect that our overall research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to innovate our informational technology capabilities, develop additional products, and expand our data management resources.

Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or acquired from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, continuing innovation, and acquisition and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of molecular diagnostics and healthcare technology products and services.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
We have developed and acquired numerous patents and patent applications and we possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of healthcare technology products and services. As of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio consisted of the following matters relating to our proprietary technology and inventions: (i) seven issued U.S. patents, including six U.S. utility patents and one U.S. design patent; (ii) eighteen pending U.S. patent applications, including sixteen U.S. utility patent applications and two U.S. design patent applications; (iii) one issued patent outside the United States; and (iv) seventeen patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside the United States. Of these U.S. and non-U.S. patents and applications, two patents and seven applications were jointly owned.
Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained.
Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The patent term may be adjusted to compensate for delayed patent issuance, when such delays are caused by the patent office or successful appeals against patent office actions. There is no limit on this patent term adjustment. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. We estimate that our issued U.S. patents will expire on dates ranging from 2022 to 2036. If patents are issued on our pending U.S. patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2026 to 2038. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of healthcare information technology has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements.
With respect to our intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products and the processes involved in using those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. However, the area of patent and other intellectual property rights in healthcare technology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented products and practicing our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our products and services. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development and testing of a potential product or service, it is possible that, before any particular product or service can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a relatively short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
- 23 -

We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section captioned “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Associates and Culture
We view our employees, which we refer to as associates, and company culture as integral to the successful execution of our vision and mission. As a result, our leadership team prioritizes establishing trusting relationships with our clients, our partners, and each other. We encourage our associates to “rise up” to the challenge and believe that this collective mindset has enabled us to attract and retain some of the best minds in technology, bioscience and healthcare to build and advance our offering. Our core values, which we seek to reflect in our work are:

• | Building and cultivating RELATIONSHIPS with our clients and each other. Treating individuals with dignity and respect and contributing to the success of others.


• | Demonstrating INTEGRITY by being intellectually honest, doing what you say, and engaging with others from a point of honesty and trust.


• | Delivering excellence in SERVICE. Aspiring to be the best through quality outcomes, partnering to optimize solutions, and holding self and others accountable for success.


• | Actively seeking out the opportunity to ELEVATE by speaking up, contributing feedback and ideas, and advancing the organization’s mission and purpose.

As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 543 full-time associates in the United States and the United Kingdom. Associate engagement is a core tenant of our leadership focus and monitor of our performance and organizational health. None of our associates are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our associates to be good.
Government Regulation
The products and services that we provide are regulated by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations can subject us to repayment of amounts previously paid to us, significant civil and criminal penalties, loss of licensure, certification, or accreditation, or exclusion from government healthcare programs. The significant areas of regulation are summarized below.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation
The Omics services we perform fall under CLIA. A clinical laboratory is required to hold certain federal and state licenses, certifications, and permits to conduct business. As to federal certifications, Congress passed CLIA in 1988, establishing quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. The laboratory that performs our Omics services is CLIA-certified and is also required to meet certain laboratory licensing requirements for states with regulations beyond CLIA.
Under CLIA, a laboratory is any facility which performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment or assessment of health. CLIA regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring they be certified by the federal government and comply with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality, and proficiency requirements intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable, and timely. Laboratories must register and list their tests with CMS, the agency that oversees the CLIA program. CLIA compliance and certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill for services provided to governmental payer program beneficiaries and for many private payers. CLIA is user-fee funded. Therefore, all costs of administering the program must be covered by the regulated facilities, including certification and survey costs.

Clinical laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards and may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than laboratories performing less complex tests. In addition, a laboratory, like the one which performs our Omics services, that is certified as “high complexity” under CLIA, may develop, manufacture, validate, and use proprietary tests referred to as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs. CLIA requires full validation, including accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, and establishment of a reference range for any LDT used in clinical testing.
In addition to the federal certification requirements under CLIA, certain states require clinical laboratories to maintain a state license. State licensure authorities typically regulate the day-to-day operations of a clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of its personnel and quality control. Certain states may also mandate proficiency testing, which requires the clinical laboratory to verify the accuracy of any test or procedure it performs. In addition, certain states require out-of-state laboratories to be licensed if they accept specimens from those states. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law. In some cases, state licensure programs substitute for the federal CLIA program. In other instances, the state’s regulations may be in addition to the CLIA program. If a laboratory is out of compliance with state laws or regulations governing licensed laboratories, penalties for violation vary from state to state but may include suspension, limitation, revocation or annulment of the license, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment.
FDA
The FDA regulates the sale and distribution in interstate commerce of medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, including in vitro diagnostic devices, reagents, and instruments used to perform diagnostic testing. Devices must undergo premarket review by the FDA prior to commercialization unless the device is of a type exempted from such review by statute, regulation, or pursuant to the FDA’s exercise of enforcement discretion. The FDA, to date, has generally not exercised its authority to actively regulate the development and use of LDTs, which are tests that are designed, manufactured, validated, and used within a single laboratory, and, therefore, we do not believe that the LDTs and other tests performed by the Omics laboratory currently require premarket clearance or approval. It is likely that the FDA will more actively regulate LDTs in the future, which could lead to premarket and post-market obligations. In October 2014, the FDA issued draft guidance documents stating that the FDA intends to change its policy and describing an approach to regulating LDTs using a risk-based, phased-in approach. In November 2016, the FDA stated that it had decided to delay finalizing its draft guidance on regulating LDTs, and it would be seeking input from the new presidential administration and Congress on the subject. Based on the request of stakeholders and the significant amount of feedback to the 2014 Draft Guidance, in January 2017, the FDA issued a Discussion Paper on LDTs in which it announced that it would not issue a final guidance on the oversight of LDTs and provided a prospective oversight framework that focuses on new and significantly modified high and moderate risk LDTs. Subject to certain limitations, the proposed focused oversight would mostly exempt a wide range of LDTs from FDA oversight, which include, but are not limited to, previously marketed LDTs (these “grandfathered” LDTs would still be subject to adverse event reporting), traditional LDTs, and low risk LDTs. In the Discussion Paper, FDA proposes a risk-based, phased in approach for premarket review of new and significantly modified LDTs and such premarket review would not be duplicative of CMS’s post market oversight of laboratory operations or clinical utility determinations. FDA also proposes to leverage existing CMS/CLIA requirements related to quality systems and expanding third party premarket review, including coordination with a range of programs, including New York’s Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program. In the meantime, the laboratory that performs the Omics services will maintain its CLIA certification, which permits the use of LDTs for the purpose of providing information for treatment and other clinical purposes.
The FDA regulations pertaining to medical devices govern, among other things, the research, design, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, clearance or approval, record-keeping, packaging, labeling, storage, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing, sales, distribution, and import and export of medical devices. Pursuant to the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the controls the FDA determines necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness.
Class I devices are those for which reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness can be provided by adherence to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include applicable portions of the FDA’s QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful, and non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Many Class I devices are exempt from premarket regulation; however, some Class I devices require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.
- 25 -

Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls, and any other special controls, such as performance standards, post market surveillance, and FDA guidelines, deemed necessary by the FDA to provide reasonable assurance of the devices’ safety and effectiveness. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices are accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, although some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirements. Premarket notifications are subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared 510(k) device or a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a premarket approval, or PMA, application. In determining substantial equivalence, the FDA assesses whether the proposed device has the same intended use and technical characteristic as the predicate device, or whether the proposed device has different technological characteristics, but the information submitted in the premarket notification demonstrates the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. The FDA may request additional information, including clinical data. Under the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, a manufacturer submits a premarket notification 90 days before introducing a device into interstate commerce, but the FDA’s review of the premarket notification can take significantly longer. If the FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device(s), the subject device may be marketed. However, if the FDA determines that a device is not substantially equivalent to the predicate device(s), then the device would be regulated as a Class III device, discussed below. If a manufacturer obtains a 510(k) clearance for its device and then makes a modification that could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness, a new premarket notification must be submitted to the FDA.
Class III devices are those deemed by FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as those that are life-sustaining or life-supporting and for which reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness cannot be assured solely by the general controls and special controls described above. Some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA require the FDA’s clearance of a premarket notification in order to be marketed. However, most Class III devices are required to undergo the PMA process in which the manufacturer must demonstrate reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. A PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence, typically extensive preclinical and clinical trial data, and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. PMA applications (and supplemental PMA applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees than are 510(k) premarket notifications. Some PMA applications are exempt from a user fee, for example, a small business’s first PMA.
Even if regulatory approval or clearance of a device is granted, the FDA may impose limitations on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted, and the device remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must register their facilities and list their devices with the FDA. A device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of some of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which covers quality management, design, production and process controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, shipping, and complaint handling. Device manufacturers must submit to the FDA medical device reports for deaths, serious injuries, and certain malfunctions and report certain field corrections and product recalls or removals. Some manufacturers also may be subject to post-market surveillance regulations. Facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: public warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, delays in or denial of 510(k) clearance or PMA applications for new products, challenges to existing 510(k) clearances or PMA applications, and a recommendation by the FDA to disallow a device manufacturer from entering into government contracts. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed. If a supplier fails to maintain compliance with a device manufacturer’s quality requirements, the manufacturer may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result.
HIPAA and HITECH
Under the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, the HHS issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by healthcare providers and other covered entities. Three principal regulations with which we are required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA: privacy regulations, security regulations, and standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions. The privacy and security regulations were extensively amended in 2013 to incorporate requirements from the HITECH Act.
- 26 -

The privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of protected health information by healthcare providers and other covered entities. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information maintained by a covered entity, including the right to access or amend certain records containing protected health information, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. The security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The HITECH Act, among other things, makes certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards applicable to business associates of covered entities, and established certain protected health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify affected individual(s) and the HHS when there is a breach of unsecured protected health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” that covered entities and their business associates must meet and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing protected health information. HIPAA also governs patient access to laboratory test reports. Effective October 6, 2014, individuals (or their personal representatives, as applicable), have the right to access test reports directly from clinical laboratories and to direct that copies of those test reports be transmitted to persons or entities designated by the individual.
These laws contain significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information. Additionally, to the extent that we submit electronic healthcare claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, payments to us may be delayed or denied.
In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are several state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to our operations. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. Massachusetts, for example, has a state law that protects the privacy and security of personal information of Massachusetts residents that is more prescriptive than HIPAA. Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results. In some cases, we are prohibited from conducting certain tests without a certification of patient consent by the physician ordering the test. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
In the United States, there are various fraud and abuse laws with which we must comply and we are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including CMS, other divisions of the HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. We also may be subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws.
In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for patient referrals for, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any healthcare item or service reimbursable under a governmental payer program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the HHS issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions, which, if met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. Many states also have anti-kickback statutes, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers.
- 27 -

In addition, federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a governmental payer program. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act 2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.
Federal and State Physician Self-referral Prohibitions
Under a federal law directed at “self-referral,” commonly known as the “Stark Law,” there are prohibitions, with certain exceptions, on referrals for certain designated health services, including laboratory services, that are covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have an investment or ownership interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, an entity performing the tests. The prohibition also extends to payment for any testing referred in violation of the Stark Law. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare or Medicaid programs in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per bill submission, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and possible exclusion from participation in federal governmental payer programs. Bills submitted in violation of the Stark Law may not be paid by Medicare or Medicaid, and any person collecting any amounts with respect to any such prohibited bill is obligated to refund such amounts. Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals.
- 28 -

Corporate Practice of Medicine
Numerous states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. For example, California’s Medical Board has indicated that determining what diagnostic tests are appropriate for a particular condition and taking responsibility for the ultimate overall care of the patient, including providing treatment options available to the patient, would constitute the unlicensed practice of medicine if performed by an unlicensed person. Violation of these corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against us and/or the physician through licensure proceedings. Typically, such laws are only applicable to entities that have a physical presence in the state.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted several legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our business. In the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in the health care system with the stated goal of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, the ACA contains certain measures that may be significant for our business. The ACA includes, among other things, provisions regarding initiatives to revise Medicare payment methodologies; the coordination and promotion of research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures; and initiatives to promote quality indicators in payment methodologies. The ACA also includes an annual excise tax on device manufacturers of 2.3% of the price for which manufacturers sell their devices. The excise tax has been temporarily suspended for calendar years 2016 through 2019, but will be reinstated in 2020 without additional Congressional action.
There have been other health reform measures taken since the enactment of the ACA. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction (known as sequestration) to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, beginning April 1, 2013, which, following passage of subsequent legislation, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Furthermore, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, increased the statute of limitations for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three years to five years.
The current presidential administration and Congress are also expected to attempt broad sweeping changes to the current health care laws. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the ACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those changes on us and potential effect on the participants in the health care system as a whole is currently unknown. But, any changes to the ACA are likely to have an impact on our results of operations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.
European Regulation
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain clearance or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may be different.
- 29 -

The primary regulatory body in Europe is the European Commission, which has adopted numerous directives and has promulgated standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the European Conformity Marking, or CE Mark, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the member states of the European Union, and other countries that comply with or mirror these directives. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a notified body, an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system, review of technical documentation, and specific testing of the manufacturer’s device. Such an assessment may be required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout these countries. We previously received authorization to affix the CE Mark to our HBox device connectivity hardware under Directive 2006/95/EC. The final form of the European Medical Device Regulation, which will replace Europe’s Medical Device Directive, was adopted on May 25, 2017 and it becomes effective on May 25, 2020. The Medical Device Regulation will apply in parallel with the Medical Device Directive for a transition period of three years. Our standard DeviceConX software product is not regulated under the European Medical Device Regulation or Europe’s Medical Device Directive, but we are currently pursuing a version of our DeviceConX software that may be distributed in Europe and that meets the European Medical Device Regulation, which software would bear a CE Mark upon completion of applicable assessments.
Other Regulatory Requirements
The laboratory performing the Omics services is subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical, biological agents and compounds, blood and bone marrow samples, and other human tissue. Typically, the laboratory uses outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of such waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers, including requirements to develop and implement programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries.
Backlog
We have no material backlog of orders.
Geographic and Segment Information
During 2018, substantially all of our long-lived assets were located within the United States and United Kingdom. 
Revenue from international markets were approximately 2% of our consolidated revenue for 2018 and approximately 2% of our consolidated revenue for 2017.
We operate in one segment. The Company has one business activity and does not segregate its business for internal reporting. Accordingly, management has determined that the Company operates in one reportable segment.
Seasonality
Our revenues are not seasonal in nature.
