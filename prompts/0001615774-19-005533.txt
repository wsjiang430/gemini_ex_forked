Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
We are a provider of next generation physical and virtual payment services that we introduced to the Mexican market in the third quarter of 2014. We have a ten-year renewable exclusive license agreement for the use of technology that can be used to perform services that are similar to services that have been successfully deployed with this technology in several European, Asian, North and South American countries.
 
We provide an integrated network of kiosks, terminals and payment channels that enable consumers to deposit cash, convert it into a digital form and remit the funds to any merchant in our network quickly and securely. We help consumers and merchants connect more efficiently in markets and consumer segments, such as Mexico, that are largely cash-based and lack convenient alternatives for consumers to pay for goods and services in physical, online and mobile environments. For example, we license technology that can be used to pay bills, add minutes to mobile phones, purchase transportation tickets, shop online, buy digital services or send money to a friend or relative.
 
Our current focus is on Mexico which remains a cash-dominated society for retail consumer payments with approximately 80% of the value of personal payments exchanged in cash (Bank of Mexico). The penetration of electronic payment services, such as credit and debit cards and point of sale terminals, significantly lags behind more developed economies. We believe that opportunities for our services in Mexico are vast. With over 109 million mobile subscribers in Mexico, 85% of which are under prepaid plans, the mobile sector was a $13 billion business in 2017 as reported by the Competitive Intelligence Unit (the “CIU”). We believe that there is opportunity for growth in the Mexican market and we have expanded to service providers beyond the mobile telephone operators to service providers of electricity, transportation, utilities, municipal services and taxes, consumer credit installments, insurance premiums, and many more. Altogether as of the end of the 2018 our platform had integrated over 150 such services, including the National Lottery’s; Pronosticos.
 
Our primary strategy in Mexico to date has been the attraction of service providers, the sale of kiosks into various verticals such as the financial, retail, transportation and government sectors, as well as the deployment of kiosks through Redpag Electrónicos S.A.P.I. de C.V., our kiosk management subsidiary. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we generated net revenues of $7,936,273 and $3,941,273, respectively, an increase of $3,995,000 or 101.4% from our operations in Mexico. Our primary source of revenue are commissions and fees we receive for processing payments made by consumers to service providers. We also generate revenue from non-payment services such as kiosk sales, transaction fees and software development. We currently have in excess of 150 service providers integrated into our payment gateway, which includes all major mobile phone providers in Mexico as well as most utility companies, such as gas, water, electricity and the like, financial services, entertainment services, as well as government payments for 12 of the 32 states. As of December 31, 2018, QPAGOS had deployed over 239 kiosks and terminals and service an additional 440 kiosks of an independent distributor. QPAGOS kiosks and terminals can be found at convenience stores, next to metro stations, retail stores, municipalities, education centers, shopping malls, in large and small cities as well as rural towns. QPAGOS kiosks have the advantage that they can connect with QPAGOS payments platform via LAN, Wi-Fi or mobile data, thus are operational wherever there is mobile connectivity which in Mexico covers over 90% of the 120 million population.
 
We believe that QPAGOS platform provides simple and intuitive user interfaces, convenient access and best-in-class services. QPAGOS runs its network and processes its transactions using a proprietary, advanced technology platform that leverages the latest virtualization, analytics and security technologies to create a fast, highly reliable, secure and redundant system. We believe that the breadth and reach of this network, along with the proprietary nature of its technology platform, differentiate us from our competitors and allow us to effectively manage and update our services and realize significant operating leverage with growth in volumes.

QPAGOS Corporate History and Background
 
Our current corporate structure is as follows:   
 

QPAGOS was incorporated on September 25, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada originally under the name Asiya Pearls, Inc. On May 27, 2016, Asiya Pearls, Inc. filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from Asiya Pearls, Inc. to QPAGOS.
 
Qpagos Corporation was incorporated on May 1, 2015 under the laws of Delaware under the name Qpagos Corporation as the holding company for its two 99.9% owned operating subsidiaries, QPagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. and Redpag Electrónicos S.A.P.I. de C.V. Each of these entities were incorporated in November 2013 in Mexico.
 
QPagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. was formed to process payment transactions for service providers it contracts with as well as provide electronic payment solutions to multiple clients in several industry segments including retail, financial transportation and government; and Redpag Electrónicos S.A.P.I. de C.V. was formed to deploy and operate kiosks as a distributor of Qpagos.
 
On August 31, 2015, QPAGOS Corporation entered into various agreements with the shareholders of Qpagos and Redpag to give effect to a reverse merger transaction (the “Reverse Merger’’). Pursuant to the Reverse Merger, the majority of the shareholders of Qpagos and Redpag effectively received shares in Qpagos Corporation, through various consulting and management agreements entered into with Qpagos Corporation and sold an effective 99.996% and 99.990% of the outstanding shares in Qpagos and Redpag, respectively to Qpagos Corporation. The series of transactions closed effective August 31, 2015. Upon the close of the Reverse Merger, Qpagos Corporation became the parent of Qpagos and Redpag and assumed the operations of these two companies as its sole business.
 
On May 12, 2016, Qpagos Corporation entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with QPAGOS and QPAGOS Merge, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of QPAGOS (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 12, 2016 Qpagos Corporation and Merger Sub merged (the “Merger”), and Qpagos Corporation continued as the surviving corporation of the Merger and became a wholly owned subsidiary of QPAGOS. As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of Qpagos Corporation common stock was converted into the right to receive two shares of QPAGOS common stock as set forth in the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we issued, and Qpagos Corporation stockholders received in a tax-free exchange, shares of our common stock such that Qpagos Corporation stockholders owned approximately 91% of our company immediately after the Merger. In addition, each outstanding warrant of Qpagos Corporation was assumed by us and converted into a warrant to acquire a number of shares of our common stock equal to twice the number of shares of common stock of Qpagos Corporation subject to the warrant immediately before the effective time of the Merger at an exercise price per share of Company common stock equal to 50% of the warrant exercise price for Qpagos Corporation common stock. There were no options outstanding in Qpagos Corporation prior to the merger.
 
On December 27, 2018 QPAGOS issued stock options to management, exercisable over 2,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.04 per share.
 
Our principal offices are located at Paseo del la Reforma 404 Piso 15 PH, Col. Juarez, Del. Cuauhtémoc, Mexico, D.F. C.P. 06600, and our telephone number at that office is +52 (55) 55–110–110. We also have offices in the United States that are located at 1900 Glades Road, Suite 280, Boca Raton, Florida 33431. We maintain an Internet website at www.qpagos.com.

Our Strategy
 
Our mission is to leverage the experience and success of other global companies in our industry, and establish ourselves as the leading developer and supplier of state-of-the-art electronic payment solutions to Mexican merchants and service providers across all consumer segments, such as: fixed and mobile telephone operators, internet services providers, cable, entertainment, public and municipal services such as electricity, water and gas, financial and travel services. Our near-term strategy includes:

● | Positioning ourselves as the leading consumer payment solutions provider for all service providers that rely on electronic payments for their collection needs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishing a successful distributor network based on a competitive distribution model for entrepreneurs that look at our self-service kiosks as a profitable business opportunity, as well as retail chains and retail banks that need to expedite electronic payments that are clogging teller lines through the assistance of self-service kiosks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing customer-specific payment solutions that allow clients to enhance their customer experience by combining mobile and hardware interfaces, such as mobile wallets and self-service kiosks, into a seamless customer-centric eco-system.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Business Model
 
Our primary source of revenue are commissions and fees we receive for processing payments.
 
During 2018 we processed approximately 4,404,734 payment transactions, compared to 2,102,065 in 2017, an increase of 109.5%.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, these transactions generated $7,936,273 in net revenue, of which approximately $7,296,640 (2017: $3,343,833) is net revenue derived from the operations of QPagos S.A.P.I. de C.V. and $643,633 (2017: $597,440) is net revenue derived from the operations of Redpag. We earn a gross profit of approximately 4.7% (2017: 5.9%) on airtime sales on kiosks operated by Redpag and approximately 0.1% gross profit on wholesale operations by which we provide air time and services to other non-kiosk distributors. We also earn commissions on payment services we provide to end-users through our kiosks and kiosks operated by third parties. This fee is either a transactional based fee of between USD$0.50 and USD$0.75 per transaction or a percentage of the transaction value. Certain service providers require that we receive the entire fee solely from the customers.
 
Our customers buy kiosks or terminals from us for approximately $6,000. The customer retains a portion of the fees that we derive from the service providers for transactions performed at the kiosks. Typically, 65% to 70% of the fees we receive from service providers are shared with the agent that has purchased the kiosk, and we retain 30–35% of such fees.
 
In addition, for certain public areas, such as malls and shopping centers, government agencies and large retailers who want to monetize high traffic locations, we pay the space owner a rental fee, and revenue share a smaller percentage of the commission, typically 10%. We also generate monthly rental fees for collocating our kiosks in municipal offices and integrating their services into our platform.
 
Additionally, when a distributor integrates their services into Qpagos platform, such as a lending institution, for their transactions done at their kiosks we charge a transaction fee that may average $0.10, while that same transaction may generate up to $0.50 when done in other kiosks in Qpagos network.

Partners-Service Providers
 
Our current focus has been on the prepaid mobile telephone market. According to GSMA Intelligence, Inc. Q4 2017 in Mexico, 85% of the more than 110 million mobile connections are under prepaid programs, thus millions of people make payments into these plans on a frequent basis. We currently have integrated over 150 service providers, including all principal mobile operators in Mexico, major utilities and the national lottery system “Pronosticos”. Also, QPagos has integrated 10 of Mexico’s 32 states in its payment platform, and citizens of these states can now pay at our kiosks, municipal services, such as car registration, property taxes, traffic tickets, etc.
 
Our Distribution Network
 
QPagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V is developing a distribution network along several verticals, principally: (i) an agent network of independent businesses with high customer traffic in which our kiosks can be deployed; (ii) retailers that seek to decongest teller lines and shift service payments to self-service kiosks, (iii) banks and other financial intermediaries that want to extend geographic collection points to their customers, while also improving the experience of their customers when making payments at branches, (iv) government municipalities that want to bring service payments closer to their citizens; (v) other electronic payments distributors who we wholesale our services to, and (vi) our own distributor Redpag Electrónicos with its growing network in Mexico City and adjoining states.
 
Agents who own kiosks and terminals are responsible for placing, operating and servicing them in high-traffic, convenient retail locations. Several of our agents are mid-sized businesses which we believe provides them with insight into local market dynamics. The agency agreements that we enter into are usually for an indefinite term and may be unilaterally terminated by either party. Our agent contracts do not have exclusivity clauses. We usually cap these fees, and normally award the agents a percentage of the merchant fees. No one agent represented a material amount of our revenue, and we do not view ourselves as being dependent upon any one agent.
 
Our retail and institutional clients and prospects include large retail and convenience store chains, whose tellers are being congested by service payments and who would like to move these frequent transactions to the front of their stores. We have done field trials with a large financial institution that wants to expedite collections of their financial services as well as expand their hours of operation and geographic reach to reduce transaction costs and improve customer experience by reducing wait lines with our kiosks; and state, government and local municipalities that want to provide their citizens easy access to payments. We look forward to consolidating this market opportunity during 2019. 
 
Research and Development Expenditure
 
We continuously develop our product offering and make technical improvements to our software, these expenses are incurred primarily as consulting fees paid to third party developers. In this area for example we have developed mobile applications to allow customers to access the same menu of service payments in our kiosks through their mobile devices as well as developing complex applications such as the National Lottery’s Pronosticos. We have spent approximately $150,000 and $80,000 for years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 on   research and new product development.
Marketing
 
We participate in several local events and exhibitions and provide promotional materials to distributors and retailers. We have also engaged in public relations campaigns geared towards corporate and institutional businesses, which has resulted in several business meetings with large box retailers such as Walmart, OXXO, Casa Ley, 7-Eleven, Circle K and many others. We have participated frequently in the International Franchising Exhibition in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Puebla, Ciudad Juarez and Monterrey, and yearly in ANTAD’s Guadalajara Exhibition, the association that groups the country’s mayor retail chains.
Our Technology
 
We run our network and process our transactions using the proprietary, advanced technology platform that we license, which leverages the latest virtualization, analytics and security technologies to create a fast, highly reliable, secure and redundant system. We believe that the breadth and reach of our network, along with the proprietary nature of the technology platform that we license, differentiates us from our competitors and allow us to effectively manage and update our services and realize significant operating leverage with growth in volumes.
 
We have adapted our technology to be device agnostic and today consumers can access our payment services through multiple devices, such as POS, Mobile, PC and self-service kiosks.
 
Competition
 
The payment services industry is highly competitive, and our continued growth depends on our ability to compete effectively. Although we do not face direct competition in exactly the same line of business, as no major self-service electronic payment kiosk vendors with a payment platform exists in Mexico today, we do face competition from teller-assisted operations at a variety of financial and non-financial institutions. These include retail banks, convenience stores, retail chains and mom and pop stores that provide counter based payment services. Competitors in our industry seek to differentiate themselves by features and functionalities such as speed, convenience, network geographic coverage, accessibility, hours of operation, reliability and price. A significant number of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we have, operate robust networks and could decide to develop their own self-service kiosks solutions instead of buying from Qpagos.

We believe that the most serious competition comes from brick and mortar locations since the bulk of the mobile top-up business is done at major retail chains such as Walmart, Soriana, Chedraui and convenience stores such as OXXO and 7-Eleven. For example, Monterrey-based OXXO, owned by Coca-Cola bottler FEMSA, with over 18,000 stores is the largest retailer network in Mexico with daily visits of over 8 million people. Because of this high concentration of customers, OXXO has become one of the primary destinations to top up prepaid phones as well as paying utility bills, receive their money transfers, deposit into bank accounts acquire cash from cards and other payment services; in fact company states that 80% of collections are towards payment services. These brick and mortar retailers are also our key target market as they are experiencing congestion at their physical teller operations and are exploring alternatives for expediting payments through the use of self-service kiosks. We are currently in dialogues with several of these retailers which want to address teller congestion caused by the large number of customers seeking to make bill payments at the teller which affects both their customers and their core business as a convenience store retailer. 
 
Seasonality
 
Typically, we do not expect that our business will experience significant seasonality, except for the government sector where the first quarter of each year has much higher activity due to payment of taxes.Government and Environmental Regulation and Laws
 
Currently our business is not impacted by government regulation. We may in the future be subject to a variety of regulations aimed at preventing money laundering and financing criminal activity and terrorism, financial services regulations, payment services regulations, consumer protection laws, currency control regulations, advertising laws and privacy and data protection laws and therefore expect to experience periodic investigations by various regulatory authorities in connection with the same, which may sometimes result in monetary or other sanctions being imposed on us. Many of these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and are often unclear and inconsistent with other applicable laws and regulations, making compliance challenging and increasing our related operating costs and legal risks. In particular, there has been increased public attention and heightened legislation and regulations regarding money laundering and terrorist financing. We may have to make significant judgment calls in applying anti-money laundering legislation and risk being found in non-compliance with such laws.
 
If local authorities in Mexico choose to enforce specific interpretations of the applicable legislation that differ from ours or enact new laws, we may be found to be in violation and subject to penalties or other liabilities. This could also limit our ability in effecting such payments going forward and may increase our cost of doing business.
 
In addition, there is significant uncertainty regarding future legislation on taxation of electronic payments in Mexico, including the place where taxation may be generated. Subsequent legislation and regulation and interpretations thereof, litigation, court rulings, or other events could expose us to increased costs, liability and reputational damage that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, QPAGOS had 2 full time employees, which are its chief executive officer and chief operating officer, and 25 full-time contractors provided to it by an outsourcing company and designated to perform services for its Mexican subsidiaries Qpagos and Redpag. Qpagos Corporation had no part-time employees. None of these employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Qpagos Corporation does not have employment agreements with any employees other than its Chief Executive Officer, Gaston Pereira and its Chief Operating Officer, Andrey Novikov. See “Executive Compensation.” Qpagos Corporation also enters into consulting arrangements for IT and operational services.
