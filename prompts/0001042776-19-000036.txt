ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. (“Piedmont," "we," "our," or "us") (NYSE: PDM) is a Maryland corporation that operates in a manner so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes and engages in the acquisition, development, management, and ownership of commercial real estate properties located primarily in the Eastern-half of the United States, including properties that are under construction, are newly constructed, or have operating histories. Piedmont was incorporated in 1997 and commenced operations in 1998. Piedmont conducts business primarily through Piedmont Operating Partnership, L.P. (“Piedmont OP”), a Delaware limited partnership, as well as performing the management of our buildings through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Piedmont Government Services, LLC and Piedmont Office Management, LLC. Piedmont owns 99.9% of, and is the sole general partner of, Piedmont OP and as such, possesses full legal control and authority over the operations of Piedmont OP. The remaining 0.1% ownership interest of Piedmont OP is held indirectly by Piedmont through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Piedmont Office Holdings, Inc. ("POH"), the sole limited partner of Piedmont OP. Piedmont OP owns properties directly, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, and through various joint ventures which we control. References to Piedmont herein shall include Piedmont and all of its subsidiaries, including Piedmont OP and its subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Operating Objectives and Strategy
As of December 31, 2018, we owned and operated 54 in-service office properties comprised of approximately 16.2 million square feet of primarily Class A office space which was 93.3% leased. Collectively, 92% of our Annualized Lease Revenue (see definition below) is generated from select sub-markets located within eight major office markets located in the Eastern-half of the United States: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, Orlando, and Washington, D.C. As we typically lease to larger, credit-worthy corporate tenants, our average lease size is approximately 19,000 square feet with an average lease term remaining of approximately seven years. Our diversified tenant base is primarily comprised of investment grade or nationally recognized corporations or governmental agencies, with the majority of our Annualized Lease Revenue derived from such tenants. No tenant accounts for more than 5.1% of our Annualized Lease Revenue.
Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, with regional and/or local management offices in each of our eight major markets, Piedmont values operational excellence and is a leading participant among REITs based on the number of buildings owned and managed with Building Owners and Managers Association ("BOMA") 360 designations. BOMA 360 is a program that evaluates six major areas of building operations and management and benchmarks a building's performance against industry standards. The achievement of such a designation recognizes excellence in building operations and management. We also have focused on environmental sustainability initiatives at our properties, and approximately 80% of our office portfolio (based on square footage) has achieved and maintains "Energy Star" efficiency (a designation for the top 25% of commercial buildings in energy consumption efficiency). In addition to operational excellence, we focus on fostering long-term relationships with our high-credit quality, diverse tenant base as evidenced by our approximately 69% tenant retention rate over the past ten years. 
Our primary objectives are to maximize the risk-adjusted return to our stockholders by increasing cash flow from operations, by achieving sustainable growth in Funds From Operations, and by growing net asset value by realizing long-term capital appreciation. We manage risk by owning almost exclusively Class A, geographically diverse office properties which are among the most desirable in their respective office sub-markets. In addition to the creditworthiness of our tenants, we strive to ensure our tenants represent a broad spectrum of industry types with lease expirations that are laddered over many years. Operationally, we maintain a low leverage structure, utilizing primarily unsecured financing facilities with laddered maturities. We utilize a national buying platform of property management support services to ensure optimal pricing for landlord and tenant services, as well as to implement best practices and achieve sustainability standards. The strategies we intend to execute to achieve these objectives include:
Capitalizing on Acquisition/Investment Opportunities
Our overall acquisition/investment strategy focuses on properties within eight major office markets located primarily in the Eastern-half of the United States that were identified based on their positive economic and demographic growth trends so as to position our investments for long-term appreciation. In addition, we concentrate our portfolio in select sub-markets where efficiencies can be gained and our market expertize can be maximized. We believe these sub-markets are generally characterized by their strong amenity base, desired location for large corporate users, above-average job and rental rate growth, proximity to robust housing options, market-leading transportation infrastructure, and limited competitive REIT ownership. Both our acquisition and development activities are targeted towards attractively priced, high quality, Class A office properties that complement our existing portfolio.

Proactive Asset Management, Leasing Capabilities and Property Management
Our proactive approach to asset and property management encompasses a number of operating initiatives designed to maximize occupancy and rental rates, including the following: devoting significant resources to building and cultivating our relationships with commercial real estate executives; maintaining local management offices in markets in which we have a significant presence; demonstrating our commitment to our tenants by maintaining the high quality of our properties; and driving a significant volume of leasing transactions in a manner that provides optimal returns by using creative approaches, including early extensions, lease wrap-arounds and restructurings. We manage portfolio risk by structuring lease expirations to avoid, among other things, having multiple leases expire in the same market in a relatively short period of time; applying our leasing and operational expertise in meeting the specialized requirements of federal, state and local government agencies to attract and retain these types of tenants; evaluating potential tenants based on third party and internal assessments of creditworthiness; and using our purchasing power and market knowledge to reduce our operating costs and those of our tenants.
Recycling Capital Efficiently
We use our proven, disciplined capital recycling capabilities to maximize total return to our stockholders by selectively disposing of non-core assets and assets in which we believe full valuations have been achieved, and redeploying the proceeds of those dispositions into new investment opportunities with higher overall return prospects.
Financing Strategy
We employ a conservative leverage strategy by typically maintaining a debt-to-gross assets ratio of between 30% - 40%. To effectively manage our long-term leverage strategy, we continue to analyze various sources of debt capital to prudently ladder debt maturities and to determine which sources will be the most beneficial to our investment strategy at any particular point in time.
Use of Joint Ventures to Improve Returns and Mitigate Risk
We may selectively enter into strategic joint ventures with third parties to acquire, develop, improve or dispose of properties, thereby potentially reducing the amount of capital required by us to make investments, diversifying our sources of capital, enabling us to creatively acquire and control targeted properties, and allowing us to reduce our investment concentration in certain properties and/or markets without disrupting our operating performance or local operating capabilities.
Redevelopment and Repositioning of Properties
As circumstances warrant, we may redevelop or reposition properties within our portfolio, including the creation of additional amenities for our tenants to increase both occupancy and rental rates and thereby improve returns on our invested capital.
Information Regarding Disclosures Presented
Annualized Lease Revenue ("ALR"), a non-GAAP measure, is calculated by multiplying (i) rental payments (defined as base rent plus operating expense reimbursements, if payable by the tenant on a monthly basis under the terms of a lease that has been executed, but excluding (a) rental abatements and (b) rental payments related to executed but not commenced leases for space that was covered by an existing lease), by (ii) 12. In instances in which contractual rents or operating expense reimbursements are collected on an annual, semi-annual, or quarterly basis, such amounts are multiplied by a factor of 1, 2, or 4, respectively, to calculate the annualized figure. For leases that have been executed but not commenced relating to un-leased space, ALR is calculated by multiplying (i) the monthly base rental payment (excluding abatements) plus any operating expense reimbursements for the initial month of the lease term, by (ii) 12. Unless stated otherwise, this measure excludes revenues associated with development/re-development properties, if any.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 134 employees, with 49 of our employees working in our corporate office located in Atlanta, Georgia. Our remaining employees work in regional and/or local management offices located in our eight major markets. These employees are involved in acquiring, developing, leasing, and managing our portfolio of properties. We outsource various functions where cost efficiencies can be achieved, such as certain areas of information technology, construction, building engineering, and leasing.

Competition
We compete for tenants for our high-quality assets in major U.S. markets by fostering strong tenant relationships and by providing quality customer service including; leasing, asset management, property management, and construction management services. As the competition for high-credit-quality tenants is intense, we may be required to provide rent abatements, incur charges for tenant improvements and other concessions, or we may not be able to lease vacant space timely, all of which may impact our results of operations. We also compete with other buyers who are interested in properties we elect to acquire, which may affect the amount that we are required to pay for such properties or may ultimately result in our decision not to acquire such properties. Further, we compete with sellers of similar properties when we sell properties, which may determine the amount of proceeds we receive from the disposal, or which may result in our inability to dispose of such properties due to the lack of an acceptable return.
Financial Information About Industry Segments
Our current business primarily consists of owning, managing, operating, leasing, acquiring, developing, investing in, and disposing of office real estate assets. We internally evaluate all of our real estate assets as one operating segment, and, accordingly, we do not report segment information.
Concentration of Credit Risk
We are dependent upon the ability of our current tenants to pay their contractual rent amounts as the rents become due. The inability of a tenant to pay future rental amounts would have a negative impact on our results of operations. As of December 31, 2018, no individual tenant represented more than 5.1% of our ALR. 
Other Matters
We have contracts with various governmental agencies, exclusively in the form of operating leases in buildings we own. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks associated with these contracts.
Additionally, as the owner of real estate assets, we are subject to environmental risks. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks associated with environmental concerns.
