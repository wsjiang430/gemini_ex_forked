ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General 
 ACI Worldwide, Inc. (ACI, ACI Worldwide, the Company, we, us, or our) is a Delaware corporation incorporated in November 1993 under the name ACI Holding, Inc. ACI is largely the successor to Applied Communications, Inc. and Applied Communications Inc. Limited, which we acquired from Tandem Computers Incorporated on December 31, 1993. On July 24, 2007, we changed our corporate name from Transaction Systems Architects, Inc. to ACI Worldwide, Inc. We have been marketing our products and services under the ACI Worldwide brand since 1993 and have gained significant market recognition under this brand name. 
 We develop, market, install, and support a broad line of software products and solutions primarily focused on facilitating real-time electronic payments. Our payment capabilities, technologies, and solutions are marketed under the brand name Universal Payments, or UP, which describes the breadth and depth of ACIs product offerings. UP defines ACIs enterprise or universal payments capabilities targeting any channel, any network, and any payment type. ACI UP solutions empower customers to regain control, choice, and flexibility in todays complex payments environment, get to market more quickly, and reduce operational costs. 
 These products and services are used globally by banks, financial intermediaries, merchants and corporates, such as third-party electronic payment processors, payment associations, switch interchanges and a wide range of transaction-generating endpoints, including automated teller machines (ATM), merchant point-of-sale (POS) terminals, bank branches, mobile phones, tablets, corporations, and internet commerce sites. The authentication, authorization, switching, settlement, fraud-checking, and reconciliation of electronic payments is a complex activity due to the large number of locations and variety of sources from which transactions can be generated, the large number of participants in the market, high transaction volumes, geographically dispersed networks, differing types of authorization, and varied reporting requirements. These activities are typically performed online and are conducted 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
 ACI combines a global perspective with local presence to tailor electronic payment solutions for our customers. We believe that we have one of the most diverse and robust electronic payment product portfolios in the industry with application software spanning the entire payments value chain. We also believe that our financial performance has been attributable to our ability to design and deliver quality products and solutions coupled with our ability to identify and successfully consummate and integrate strategic acquisitions. 
 Fiscal 2016 Divestiture 
 On March 3, 2016, we completed the sale of our CFS assets and liabilities to Fiserv. The transaction included employee agreements and customer contracts as well as technology assets and intellectual property. The sale of CFS assets and liabilities enabled us to focus resources on our strategic products and new high-growth initiatives in support of large banks, financial intermediaries, merchants and corporates worldwide. 
Target Markets
 ACIs comprehensive electronic payment solutions serve four key markets:
 Banks
 ACI provides payment solutions to large and mid-size banks globally for both retail banking, digital, and other payment services. Our solutions transform banks complex payment environments to speed time to market, reduce costs, and deliver a consistent experience to customers across channels while enabling them to prevent

  and rapidly react to fraudulent activity. In addition, we enable banks to meet the requirements of different real-time payment schemes and to quickly create differentiated products to meet consumer, business, and merchant demands.
 Financial intermediaries
 ACIs payment solutions support financial intermediaries, such as processors, networks, payment service providers (PSPs), and new financial technology (FinTech) entrants. We offer these customers scalable solutions that strategically position them to innovate and achieve growth and cost efficiency, while protecting them against fraud. Our solutions also allow new entrants in the digital marketplace to access innovative payment schemes, such as the U.K. Faster Payments New Access Model, Singapore FAST and the Payments Network Malaysia (PayNet) Real-Time Retail Payments Platform.
 Merchants
 ACIs support of merchants globally includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 merchants, online-only merchants and the PSPs, independent selling organizations (ISOs), value added resellers (VARs), and acquirers who service them. These customers operate in a variety of verticals, including general merchandise, grocery, hospitality, dining, transportation, and others. Our solutions provide merchants with a secure, omni-channel payments platform that gives them independence from third-party payment providers. We also offer secure solutions to online-only merchants that provide consumers with a convenient and seamless way to shop.

On Premises or On Demand Software Delivery Options 
 Our software solutions are offered to our customers through either a traditional term software license arrangement where the software is installed and operated on the customer premises (ACI On Premise) or through an on-demand arrangement where the solution is maintained and delivered through the cloud via our global data centers (ACI On Demand). Solutions delivered through ACIs On Demand cloud are available in either a single-tenant environment, known as a software as a service (SaaS) offering, or in a multi-tenant environment, known as a platform as a service (PaaS) offering. Pricing and payment terms depend on which solutions the customer requires and their transaction volumes. Generally, customers are required to commit to a minimum contract of five years, three years in the case of certain acquired SaaS and PaaS contracts. 
Partnerships and Industry Participation 
 We have two major types of third-party product partners: Technology Partners, industry leaders with whom we work closely and drive key industry trends and mandates, and Business Partners, with whom we embed the partners technology in ACI products, host the partners software in ACIs cloud as a part of our ACI On Demand (AOD) offering, or jointly market solutions that include the products of the other company. 
 Technology partners help us add value to our solutions, stay abreast of current market conditions and industry developments such as standards. Technology partner organizations include Diebold, Inc. (Diebold), NCR Corporation (NCR), Wincor-Nixdorf, VISA, MasterCard, and SWIFT. In addition, ACI has membership in or participates in the relevant committees of a number of industry associations, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X9, Financial Services, Interactive Financial eXchange Forum (IFX), nexo standards, International Payments Framework Association (IPFA), U.K. Cards Association, and the PCI Security Standards Council. These partnerships provide direction 
 
6 


  as it relates to the specifications that are used by the card schemes, and in some cases, manufacturers. These organizations typically look to ACI as a source of knowledge and experience to be shared in conjunction with creating and enhancing their standards. The benefit to ACI is in having the opportunity to influence these standards with concepts and ideas that will benefit the market, our customers, and ACI. 
 Business partner relationships extend our product portfolio, improve our ability to get our solutions to market and enhance our ability to deliver market-leading solutions. We share revenues with these business partners based on a number of factors related to overall value contribution in the delivery of the joint solution or payment type. The agreements with business partners include referral, resale, traditional original equipment manufacturer (OEM) relationships, and transaction fee based payment-enablement partnerships. These agreements generally grant ACI the right to create an integrated solution that we host or distribute, or provide ACI access to established payment networks or capabilities. The agreements are generally worldwide in scope and have a term of several years. 
 We have alliances with our technology partners HP, IBM, Microsoft Corporation, Red Hat, Inc., and Oracle USA, Inc. (Oracle), whose industry-leading hardware, software, and cloud-based infrastructure services are utilized by ACIs products. These partnerships allow us to understand developments in the partners technology and to utilize their expertise in topics like sizing, scalability, and performance testing.

 We distribute the products of other vendors where they complement our existing product lines. We are typically responsible for the sales and marketing of the vendors products, and agreements with these vendors generally provide for revenue sharing based on relative responsibilities. 
 Proprietary Rights and Licenses 
 We rely on a combination of trade secret and copyright laws, license agreements, contractual provisions, and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We distribute our software products under software license agreements that typically grant customers nonexclusive licenses to use our products. Use of our software products is usually restricted to designated computers, specified locations and/or specified capacity, and is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction or transfer of our software products. We also seek to protect the source code of our software as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work. Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of our software products and technology will not occur. 
 In addition to our own products, we distribute, or act as a sales agent for, software developed by third parties. However, we typically are not involved in the development process used by these third parties. Our rights to those third-party products and the associated intellectual property rights are limited by the terms of the contractual agreement between us and the respective third party. 
 Although we believe that our owned and licensed intellectual property rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us. Further, there can be no assurance that intellectual property protection will be available for our products in all foreign countries. 
 Like many companies in the electronic commerce and other high-tech industries, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights to business processes, technologies, and related standards that are relevant to us and our customers. These assertions have increased over time as a result of the general increase in patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. Third parties may also claim that the third-partys intellectual property rights are being infringed by our customers use of a business process method that utilizes products in conjunction with other products, which could result in indemnification claims against us by our customers. Any claim against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product delivery delays, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or pay amounts in settlement, or require us to develop alternative non-infringing technology. We could also be required to defend or indemnify our customers against such claims. A successful claim by a third party of intellectual property infringement or one of our customers could compel us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements, pay significant damages or even stop selling certain products and incur additional costs to develop alternative non-infringing technology. 
 Government Regulation 
 Certain of our solutions are subject to federal, state, and foreign regulations and requirements. 
 Oversight by Banking Regulators. As a provider of payment services to banks and financial intermediaries, we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), an interagency body of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of 
 
15 


  the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the National Credit Union Administration and various state regulatory authorities as part of the Multi-Region Data Processing Servicer Program (MDPS). The MDPS program includes technology suppliers who provide mission critical applications for a large number of financial institutions that are regulated by multiple regulatory agencies. Periodic information technology examination assessments are performed using FFIEC interagency guidelines to identify potential risks that could adversely affect serviced financial institutions, determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations that affect the services provided to financial institutions and ensure the services we provide to financial institutions do not create systemic risk to the banking system or impact the safe and sound operation of the financial institutions we serve. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our clients auditors and regulators. We are also subject to review under state and foreign laws and rules that regulate many of the same activities that are described above, including electronic data processing and back-office services for financial institutions and the use of consumer information. 
 Money Transfer. Official Payments Corporation, our EBPP affiliate, is registered as a Money Services Business. Accordingly, we are subject to the USA Patriot Act and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and U.S. Treasury Regulations. These businesses may also be subject to certain state and local licensing requirements. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), state attorneys general, and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and licensing. In addition, most states have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission to register as a money transmitter with that jurisdictions banking department. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations. ACI has also implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries, entities and individuals based on external threats to the U.S. foreign policy, national security, or economy; by other governments; or by global or regional multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations Security Council and the European Union as applicable. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 3,807 employees. 
 None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are good. 
 Available Information 
 Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), are available free of charge on our website at www.aciworldwide.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such information electronically with the SEC. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, Room 1580, NW, Washington DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
