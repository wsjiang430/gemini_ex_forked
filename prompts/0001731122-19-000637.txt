General
 
An agreement was signed on April 8, 2019 with Real-Time Save Online to acquire the full commercial version of the website which is a price comparison site. The name was changed to RtSave.com/us and expects to launch by early 2020. RT Save is now a wholly owned subsidiary; RT Save, was incorporated May 14, 2019; and is developing a worldwide e-commerce internet platform in which revenues would be based on the purchase and sale of products and services by way of mobile/computer applications online (24/7).
 
A price comparison website is a search engine, which consumers use to compare the prices of different products. These websites are also known as comparison shopping websites, price analysis tools, comparison shopping agents, and shopbots. Users can compare products using relevant criteria, including price, product ratings, brand names, features, and consumer quality ratings. Such websites allow consumers to review products and determine the retailer that sell desired items at the lowest price. Price comparison websites offer benefits to consumers, when they navigate potentially complex purchases, and they reduce the search time by comparing similar products in one place. There are also advantages for the product or service providers because they bring together shoppers and firms more easily and, in some cases, more inexpensively than other acquisition channels. This can reduce entry barriers that providers might otherwise face. As well, it can stimulate stronger competition and innovation between firms and encourage new entrants, resulting in further benefits for consumers. Most price comparison websites use a method called “scraping,” which basically scours vendor websites for content. Often these basic price comparison websites earn their revenue by a service called a “clickthrough” or “referral fee,” which means each time a consumer clicks on specific vendors, the price comparison site makes a small commission. In the past few years this service has been supplemented by other services and more advanced services that automatically checks companies’ websites for prices.
 
The price comparison website market is expected to increase at a significant growth rate during the upcoming years. The global price comparison website market is supported by various growth drivers, such as increased internet penetration and an increase in smartphone users. Price comparison websites have become increasingly popular around the world over the last ten years. In the United Kingdom and the United States, market research groups have estimated that annually $1.5 billion transactions pass through this well-established industry, according to Wize Commerce. Because of the ease of use and straight-forward manner of these numerous websites, western consumers use price comparison websites for different price-checking exercises, including shopping, vacations, and home utilities.

Government Regulation
 
The Cellular Telephone and Internet Association, a carrier lobbying group, believes that carriers and handset manufacturers should set and enforce app standards. This would put a small set of carriers and handset makers in the role of regulator for the app industry. These companies have helped created an ecosystem where apps can flourish.
 
Many regulations are under proposal for medical and health apps nationally, some states are looking into regulations that will govern apps within their state.
