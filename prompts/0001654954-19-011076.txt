  Recent Developments
 
 On August 26, 2019, Dr. Christopher R. von Jako stepped down as our Chief Executive Officer. In connection with his departure, Dr. von Jako also resigned from the board of directors (“Board of Directors” or “Board”) of the Company effective August 26, 2019. On August 26, 2019, the Board appointed Brian D. Baker, our Chief Operating Officer, to succeed Christopher R. von Jako as the Chief Executive Officer. We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Baker, which provides for base salary of $275,000 per year and an annual bonus targeted at a maximum payout of $100,000, with any bonus amount to be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors based on results of operations and Mr. Baker’s performance against goals established by the Compensation Committee. Mr. Baker will also receive annual equity grants as determined by the Compensation Committee of restricted stock units valued at a maximum of $100,000, vesting 50% upon the date of grant and 50% on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Upon the execution of his employment agreement, the Compensation Committee and the Board also approved the grant to Mr. Baker of 50,000 restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under the Dynatronics Corporation 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”), vesting in four equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date. Upon vesting, Mr. Baker will receive a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of restricted stock units that have vested. The Compensation Committee and the Board also approved a grant to Mr. Baker of a non-qualified stock option to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the 2018 Plan, exercisable at a price per share equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The option also vests in four equal annual installments, commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Mr. Baker will operate from our Eagan, Minnesota location and as part of his compensation package, the Company will pay certain relocation expenses for Mr. Baker, not to exceed $25,000.
 
 In connection with the change in management, we entered into a Separation and Release Agreement (“Separation Agreement”) with Dr. von Jako, effective August 26, 2019. Under the terms of the Separation Agreement with Dr. von Jako, we agreed to pay him a cash payment (less applicable withholding taxes) equal to three months of base salary (excluding bonus or any pro ration thereof) in installments over the three months following September 1, 2019, the last day of his employment by the Company. The payment of the severance benefit and his continued employment through September 1, 2019 are subject to the terms and conditions of the Separation Agreement, including a release of all claims against the Company.
 
  We filed a Current Report on Form 8-K on August 28, 2019 to report these and additional details concerning the change in its principal executive officer.

  Our Products
 
 We sell products that we manufacture and we sell and distribute products that are manufactured by unrelated third parties. To distinguish between these types of products, in this report, we refer to products manufactured by any of our Dynatronics affiliated entities as “Manufactured Products” and we refer to our products that we distribute that are manufactured by third parties as “Distributed Products”. All of these products are selected by us to fulfill our goal of providing quality restorative products to our customers. Manufactured Products accounted for approximately 74% of our net sales (excluding freight, repairs, and miscellaneous items) in fiscal year 2019.
 
  We offer a broad range of restorative products for clinical use in physical therapy, rehabilitation, orthopedics, pain management, and athletic training. Our offerings include orthopedic soft bracing and support products, treatment tables, exercise and rehabilitation equipment, therapeutic modalities, and related supplies.
  
 We are consistently recognized as Best in Class by our various distribution, OEM, and branded partners for our trusted high-quality products, on-time delivery, and superior customer care. Our focus on delivering products on-time is supported by our “Quick Ship” program that promises shipment within one to 10 business days from date of order for many of our products.
   
 Our products are used primarily by orthopedists, physical therapists, chiropractors, athletic trainers, sports medicine practitioners, clinics, hospitals, and consumers. The following illustrates a few select restorative products in our portfolio.
   
  Orthopedic Soft Bracing and Support Products
  
Our orthopedic soft bracing and support products are designed to accelerate health for patients both pre- and post-surgical intervention, and during fracture recovery, joint stabilization, and ligament injury.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
 Our Bird & Cronin® brand products include, among others, cervical collars, shoulder immobilizers, arm slings, wrist and elbow supports, abdominal and lumbosacral supports, maternity supports, knee immobilizers and supports, ankle walkers and supports, plantar fasciitis splints, and cold therapy. We continually seek to update our line of soft bracing and support Manufactured Products.

 Our Dynatron Solaris®, Hausmann™, and PROTEAM™ brands, among others included physical therapy, rehabilitation, and athletic training products. These products include treatment tables, exercise and rehabilitation equipment, therapeutic modalities, and related supplies.
  
  Treatment Tables, Exercise and Rehabilitation Equipment
  We manufacture and distribute a premium line of power and manually operated treatment tables, mat platforms, work tables, parallel bars, training stairs, weight racks, treadmills, recumbent bikes, and other related equipment. These products are essential to treating patients in a variety of clinical settings.
 Therapeutic Modalities
  We manufacture and distribute a premium line of therapeutic modality devices that include electrotherapy, ultrasound, phototherapy, therapeutic laser, shortwave diathermy, radial pulse therapy, hot and cold therapy, compression therapy, and electrodes. These modalities can be effective in treating pain, increasing local blood circulation, promoting relaxation of muscle spasms, preventing retardation of disuse atrophy, and accelerating muscle re-education. Our branded line of modalities are well known to clinicians across all of our end-markets.
 Supplies
  We manufacture and distribute various clinical supplies that include exercise bands and tubing, topical analgesics, lotions and gels, orthopedic bracing, paper products, athletic tape, and other related supplies.
 Sales Mix among Key Products
 
 No single product accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in fiscal years 2019 and 2018. Sales of Manufactured Products represented approximately 74% and 70% of total product sales, excluding freight and other revenue, in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in percentage of products manufactured in fiscal year 2019 can be attributed to the acquisition of Bird & Cronin in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
 Patents and Trademarks
 
 Patents. We own a United States patent on our thermoelectric technology that will remain in effect until February 2033. We also hold a United States patent on our combination traction/phototherapy technology that will remain in effect until December 2026, and a United States patent on our phototherapy technology that will remain in effect until August 2025.
   
 Trademarks and Copyrights. We own trademarks used in our business, particularly marks relating to our corporate and product names. United States trademark registrations that are significant to our business, include Dynatron®, Dynatron Solaris®, Dynaheat®, BodyIce®, Powermatic®, Bird & Cronin®, Physician’s Choice®, and the Hausmann Logo.
 
 Federal registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the mark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered mark in connection with a similar product in the same channels of trade by any third party anywhere in the United States, regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs. We may register additional trademarks in countries where our products are or may be sold in the future. Protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection provided by registration under U.S. law. Trademark protection continues in some countries so long as the trademark is used, and in other countries, so long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely. Our print materials are also protected under copyright laws, both in the United States and internationally.
 
 We also claim ownership and protection of certain product names, unregistered trademarks, and service marks under common law. Common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection that is afforded by the registration of a trademark. In addition, common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used. We believe these trademarks, whether registered or claimed under common law, constitute valuable assets, adding to recognition of the Company and the effective marketing of our products.

 Trade Secrets. We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with key employees and other parties involved in research and development. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors.
 
 We intend to protect our legal rights in our intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel.
 
  Warranty Service
 
 We provide a warranty on all Manufactured Products for time periods generally ranging in length from 90 days to two years from the date of sale. We service warranty claims on these products at our Utah, Tennessee, New Jersey and Minnesota sites depending on the product and service required. We also have field service available in other parts of the United States. Our warranty policies are comparable to warranties generally available in the industry. Warranty claims were approximately $88,000 in fiscal year 2019, and $123,000 in fiscal year 2018.
 
 Distributed Products carry warranties provided by the various manufacturers of those products. We do not generally supplement these warranties or provide unreimbursed warranty services for Distributed Products. We also sell accessory items for our Manufactured Products that are supplied by other manufacturers. These accessory products carry warranties from their original manufacturers without supplement from us.
 
  Customers and Markets
 
 We sell our products to licensed practitioners such as orthopedists, physical therapists, chiropractors, and athletic trainers. Our customers also include professional sports teams and universities, sports medicine specialists, post-acute care facilities, hospitals, clinics, retail distributors and equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners. Throughout the United States and internationally, we utilize a network of over 300 independent dealers. Most dealers purchase and take title to the products, which they then sell to end users. In addition, we utilize a network of independent sales representatives combined with a small number of targeted direct sales representatives.
 
 We have entered into agreements with independent clinics and hospitals, regional and national chains of physical therapy clinics and hospitals, integrated delivery networks, group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), and government agencies. We sell products directly to these clinics, hospitals, and groups pursuant to preferred pricing arrangements. No single customer or group of related accounts was responsible for 10% or more of net sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018.
 
 We export products to approximately 30 different countries. Sales outside North America totaled approximately $1,435,000 in fiscal year 2019 (or approximately 2.3% of net sales) and $1,479,000 in fiscal year 2018 (or approximately 2.3% of net sales). We have no foreign manufacturing operations, but we purchase certain products and components from foreign manufacturers.

     Competition
 
 We do not compete with a single competitor across all of our product lines. Our industry comprises numerous competitors of varying sizes, including personal care companies, branded consumer healthcare companies and private label manufacturers. Information necessary to determine or reasonably estimate our market share or that of any competitor in any of these markets of our highly fragmented industry is not readily available to us.
 
 We compete against various manufacturers and distributors, some of which are larger and more established, and have greater resources available to them, than Dynatronics. Our competitors in soft bracing and support products are primarily regional manufacturers, as well as several large corporations. Our competitors in treatment tables, exercise and rehabilitation equipment, and related supplies are from several domestic and international manufacturers and distributors.
 
 In the clinical market for therapeutic modality devices we compete with both domestic and foreign companies. Several of our products are protected by patents or where patents have expired, the proprietary technology on which those patents were based. We believe that the integration of advanced technology in the design of our products has distinguished Dynatronics-branded products in this competitive market. For example, we were the first company to integrate infrared phototherapy as part of a combination therapy device. We believe these factors give us a competitive edge. Our primary domestic competitors in the therapeutic device manufacturing market include four large manufacturers.
 
 Trusted high-quality brands, on-time product delivery, and superior customer care are of key importance for us to remain competitive in this market and to maintain established relationships within our distribution channels.

 
  Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 
 We produce Manufactured Products at our facilities in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Northvale, New Jersey and Eagan, Minnesota. Our Manufactured Products utilize custom components both fashioned internally from sourced raw materials, as well as components purchased from third-party suppliers. All parts and components purchased from these suppliers meet established specifications. Trained staff performs all sub-assembly, final assembly and quality assurance testing by following established procedures. Our design and development process ensures that products meet specified design requirements. The supply chain process manages suppliers of components and materials to ensure their quality and availability for our manufacturing teams.
 
 The development and manufacture of a portion of our products manufactured at our Utah facility is subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and international regulatory agencies. In compliance with the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and standards established by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, we have developed a comprehensive Quality System that processes customer feedback and analyzes product performance trends. Conducting prompt reviews of timely information, allows us to respond to customer needs and ensure quality performance of the devices we produce.
 
 Our Utah facility holds certification to ISO 13485:2016 (MDSAP Audit Model) related to country specific requirements for the USA, Canada, and Japan.
 
 Products manufactured at our facilities in Utah, Tennessee, New Jersey, and Minnesota meet the requirements of cGMP. This quality system ensures the provision of products and services meet the expectations of our customers.

  Research and Development
 
 Total research and development (“R&D”) expenses in fiscal year 2019 were $54,000, compared to approximately $1,194,000 in fiscal year 2018. The decrease is primarily due to the re-purposing of our engineering resources to operational improvements. As a percentage of net sales, R&D expenses represented approximately 0.1% and 1.9% in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 Regulatory Matters
 
 The manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates some of our products pursuant to the Medical Device Amendment of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and regulations promulgated under the FDC Act. Advertising and other forms of promotion (including claims) and methods of marketing of the products are subject to regulation by the FDA and by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, under the Federal Trade Commission Act.
 
 As a medical device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and once registered we are subject to inspection for compliance with the FDA’s Quality Systems regulations. These regulations require us to manufacture our products and maintain related documents in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, and control activities. Further, we are required to comply with various FDA requirements for reporting customer complaints involving our devices. The FDC Act and its medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA if allegations are made that one of our products has caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if a malfunction of a product would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. The FDA also prohibits an approved device from being marketed for unapproved uses. All of our therapeutic treatment devices as currently designed are cleared for marketing under section 510(k) of the Medical Device Amendment to the FDC Act or are considered 510(k) exempt. If a device is subject to section 510(k) approval requirements, the FDA must receive pre-market notification from the manufacturer of its intent to market the device. The FDA must find that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device before the agency will clear the new device for marketing.
 
 We intend to continuously improve our products after they have been introduced to the market. Certain modifications to our marketed devices may require a pre-market notification and clearance under section 510(k) before the changed device may be marketed, if the change or modification could significantly affect safety or effectiveness. As appropriate, we may therefore submit future 510(k) notifications to the FDA. No assurance can be given that clearance or approval of such new applications will be granted by the FDA on a timely basis, or at all. Furthermore, we may be required to submit extensive pre-clinical and clinical data depending on the nature of the product changes. All of our devices, unless specifically exempted by regulation, are subject to the FDC Act’s general controls, which include, among other things, registration and listing, adherence to the Quality System Regulation requirements for manufacturing, medical device reporting and the potential for voluntary and mandatory recalls described above.
 
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as the Affordable Care Act, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law. The Affordable Care Act provided for a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of medical devices, including our products, effective as of 2013. The excise tax was suspended for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2016 and was further suspended through December 31, 2019. The passage of the Affordable Care Act imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain healthcare providers. Specifically, any transfer of value exceeding $10 in a single transfer or cumulative transfers over a one-year period exceeding $100 to any statutorily defined practitioner (primarily physicians, podiatrists, and chiropractors) must be reported to the federal government by March 31st of each year for the prior calendar year. The data is assembled and posted to a publicly accessible website by September 30th following the March 31st reporting date. If we fail to provide these reports, or if the reports we provide are not accurate, we could be subject to significant penalties. Several states have adopted similar reporting requirements. We believe we are in compliance with the Affordable Care Act and we have systems in place to assure continued compliance.

 The medical device excise tax included in the Affordable Care Act is an excise tax on the first sale of medical devices by a manufacturer, producer, or importer equal to 2.3% of the sales price. Taxable medical devices include any device as defined in Section 201(h) of the FDC Act intended for humans, with the exception of eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids and any other device determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to be a type which is generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use (“exempt devices”). On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law H.R. 2029, the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016,” which included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax, effective January 1, 2016. In January 2018, the tax was suspended for an additional two-year period. Absent further legislative action, the tax will be automatically reinstated for medical device sales starting on January 1, 2020.
  
 In March 2017, the FDA published guidance relating to Class II devices that would no longer be required to submit a pre-market notification (510(k)). This list was finalized in the Federal Register on July 11, 2017. Among the Class II devices exempted by this determination are some phototherapy devices such as those manufactured by us. That guidance indicates that such devices are considered safe and effective without adding the burden of a pre-market approval by the FDA. While this change diminishes the regulatory burden for such products, it also lowers the barriers to entry for competitive products. We view this change as generally positive for us and our ability to leverage existing technology competencies in this segment.
 
 Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines, and criminal prosecutions. Any such action by the FDA could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products. Our Utah, Tennessee and New Jersey facilities are inspected periodically by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s cGMP and other requirements, including appropriate reporting regulations and various requirements for labeling and promotion. The FDA Current Quality Systems Regulations are similar to the ISO 13485 Quality Standard. The cGMP regulation requires, among other things, that (i) the manufacturing process be regulated and controlled by the use of written procedures, and (ii) the ability to produce devices that meet the manufacturer’s specifications be validated by extensive and detailed testing of every aspect of the process.
 
 Advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the FTC under the FTC Act. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Section 12 of the FTC Act provides that the dissemination or the causing to be disseminated of any false advertisement pertaining to, among other things, drugs, cosmetics, devices or foods, is an unfair or deceptive act or practice. Pursuant to this FTC requirement, we are required to have adequate substantiation for all advertising claims made about our products. The type of substantiation required depends upon the product claims made.
 
 If the FTC has reason to believe the law is being violated (e.g., a manufacturer or distributor does not possess adequate substantiation for product claims), it can initiate an enforcement action. The FTC has a variety of administrative and judicial processes and remedies available to it for enforcement, including compulsory process authority, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement could result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, consumer redress, and divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of such orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any such action against us by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products.
 
 From time to time, legislation is introduced in the Congress of the United States or in state legislatures that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of medical devices and products like those we manufacture. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance, or interpretations will be changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be on our business and our results of operations. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, domestically or internationally, would have on our business in the future. They could include, however, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, and additional scientific substantiation. The necessity of complying with any or all such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
 
 In addition to compliance with FDA rules and regulations, we are also required to comply with international regulatory laws including Health Canada, CE Mark, or other regulatory schemes used by other countries in which we choose to do business. Foreign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more common, and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future. Penalties for non-compliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and criminal sanctions. Any domestic or foreign governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us. We believe all of our present products are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable performance standards in countries where the products are sold. We also believe that our products comply with cGMP, record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of the products in the United States.

  Foreign Government Regulation
 
 Although it is not a current focus, we may expand our activities to market our products in select international markets in the future. The regulatory requirements for our products vary from country to country. Some countries impose product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on some of the products we manufacture and distribute. Each country has its own tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Environment
 
 Environmental regulations and the cost of compliance with them are not material to our business. Numerous federal, state and local laws regulate the sale of products containing certain identified ingredients that may impact human health and the environment. For instance, California has enacted Proposition 65, which requires the disclosure of specified listed ingredient chemicals on the labels of products sold in that state and the use of warning labels when such ingredients may be found. We believe we are compliant with such regulations.
 Seasonality
 
 Our business is affected by some seasonality, which could result in fluctuation in our operating results. Sales are typically higher in our first and fourth fiscal quarters (the summer and spring months), while sales in our second and third fiscal quarters are generally slower (the fall and winter months). Therefore, our quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year, and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.
 Employees
 
 As of June 30, 2019, we employed 284 people, of which 269 were employed on a full-time basis. Certain of our employees (52 individuals) are subject to a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in February 2022. We believe our labor relations with both union and non-union employees are satisfactory.
