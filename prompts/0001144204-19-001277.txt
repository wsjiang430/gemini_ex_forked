ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Organization
 
China HGS Real Estate Inc. (the “Company” or “China HGS,” “we”, “our”, “us”), formerly known as China Agro Sciences Corp.,  is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Florida.
 
HGS Investment is a Delaware corporation and owns 100% of the equity interest in Shaanxi HGS Management and Consulting Co., Ltd. (“Shaanxi HGS”), a wholly owned foreign entity incorporated under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”).
 
China HGS does not conduct any substantive operations of its own. Instead, through its subsidiary, Shaanxi HGS, it entered into certain exclusive contractual agreements with Shaanxi Guangsha Investment and Development Group Co., Ltd. (“Guangsha”). Pursuant to these agreements, Shaanxi HGS is obligated to absorb a majority of the risk of loss from Guangsha’s activities and entitles Shaanxi HGS to receive a majority of Guangsha’s expected residual returns. In addition, Guangsha’s shareholders have pledged their equity interest in Guangsha to Shaanxi HGS, irrevocably granted Shaanxi HGS an exclusive option to purchase, to the extent permitted under PRC Law, all or part of the equity interests in Guangsha and agreed to entrust all the rights to exercise their voting power to the person(s) appointed by Shaanxi HGS.  
 
Based on these contractual arrangements, we believe that Guangsha should be considered a “Variable Interest Entity” (“VIE”) under ASC 810 “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51”, because the equity investors in Guangsha no longer have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and the Company, through Shaanxi HGS, is the primary beneficiary of Guangsha and its operations.
 
Our Company, along with our subsidiaries and VIE, engages in real estate development, primarily in the construction and sale of residential apartments, car parks and commercial properties.
 
Guangsha was organized in August 1995 as a limited liability company under the laws of the PRC. Guangsha is headquartered in the city of Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province. Guangsha is engaged in developing large scale and high quality commercial and residential projects, including multi-layer apartment buildings, sub-high-rise apartment buildings, high-rise apartment buildings, and office buildings.
 
Our corporate structure is set forth below:

Business Overview
 
We conduct substantially all of our business through our subsidiary and VIE in China. All of our business is conducted in mainland China. Guangsha was founded by Mr. Xiaojun Zhu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and commenced operations in 1995 in Hanzhong, a prefecture-level city in Shaanxi Province.
 
Since Guangsha was founded, management has been focused on expanding our business in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties in China that we strategically select based on population and urbanization growth rates, general economic conditions and growth rates, income and purchasing power of resident consumers, anticipated demand for private residential properties, availability of future land supply and land prices, and governmental urban planning and development policies. We utilize a standardized and scalable model that emphasizes rapid asset turnover, efficient capital management and strict cost control. We plan to expand into strategically selected Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties with real estate development potential in Shaanxi Province, and expect to benefit from rising demand for residential housing as a result of increasing income levels of consumers and growing populations in these cities and counties due to urbanization.
 
In fiscal 2019, our Liangzhou Road related projects, which consist of residential buildings, office buildings and commercial plaza, will start construction after the approval by the local government of the road and become a new city center of Hanzhong city.
 
Real Estate Industry Overview
 
During the volatile real estate market, the Company has been capitalizing on its inherent strengths and market opportunities in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties to deliver value for our shareholders. We feel confident and also competent to take on every challenge and grasp every opportunity during market consolidation. We expect to provide rapid response to the market on the basis of our projected business plans together with a flexible approach in seizing market opportunities; strict investment standard and prudent attitude towards investment opportunities, and appropriate replenishment of quality land resources in existing regions to realize value within the Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties in Western China.

Company Positioning The Company is headquartered in Hanzhong in the southwestern part of the Shaanxi province, in the center of the Hanzhong Basin, on the Han River, near the Sichuan border. According to the China City Statistical Yearbook, Hanzhong had a population of about 3.8 million in 2017 calendar year. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Hanzhong is a key transportation hub connecting China’s Middle Economic zone and Western Economic Zone. The travel time from Xi’an, the provincial capital of Shaanxi province, to Hanzhong takes less than 2 hours. The new airport in Hanzhong was completed and put into service in 2014. The airport is expected to handle 300,000 passengers and 1,300 tons of cargo by 2020. Xicheng, a high-speed railway between Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan province, and Xi’an with a major stop in Hanzhong was completed in 2017. It takes 1.5 hours from Hanzhong to Xi’an and 2.5 hours from Hanzhong to Chengdu. The railway passenger’s volume is expected to increase from 1.5 million to 6 million by 2020.

In accordance with Hanzhong Government’s 2017 annual report, Hanzhong’s GDP reached RMB 133.3 billion (approximately $20.4 billion) by 2017 calendar year, representing a 15.3% increase from 2016 calendar year. Residents’ annual disposable income for 2017 calendar year was RMB 27,812 (equivalent to $4,255), representing an 8.7% increase as compared to 2016 calendar year.
 

Many Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties in China provide a major source of migration workers for the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities in China. The income from migration workers also is becoming a significant factor in supporting the hometown economy. Based on Hanzhong Government’s 2017 annual report, the number of Hanzhong’s migration workers reached approximately 822,800 as of December 31, 2017 (2016 – 816,700). Total income from migration workers was about RMB 21.6 billion (equivalent to approximately $3.3 billion) in 2017 calendar year (2016 – RMB 17.6 billion or approximately $2.6 billion).
 
The target market of the Company is in Western China. The Company continues to focus on Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties in acquiring sizable quality land reserves at low cost in a flexible and diversified manner. There has been an increasing demand for high quality residential housing, largely driven by the “Go West” policy and accelerated urbanization. Many buyers in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties are first time home buyers. In order to mitigate default risk, the Company generally requires from its homebuyer customers a deposit in the range of 30%-50% of the purchase price, which is higher than the percentage required by the government for the mortgage down payment.
 
The Company received the National Grade-I real-estate development qualification granted by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the People's Republic of China ("MOHURD")"on October 12, 2011. The Grade-I real-estate development qualification is the highest qualification for real-estate developers in China and requires meeting several strict criteria, including:
 
a. Registered capital of at least RMB 50 million (approximately $7.3 million);
 b. At least five years of experience in real estate development and operation;
 c. The completion of construction of a total over 300,000 square meters. of ground floor area (GFA) within the last three years and, in the most recent year, developed real estate projects of at least 150,000 square meters; and
 d. The completed real estate projects have no quality issues in each of the past five years; and an established, comprehensive quality control and guarantee system.
 
The National Grade-I real-estate development qualification provides significant opportunities for the Company to expand its operations beyond Shaanxi province into new regional real estate markets in China.
 
Looking ahead, the Company will continue to focus on developing high quality and large scale real estate projects in the suburban areas of Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties with promising economic growth potential. Leveraging on its unique competitive strengths, and under the direction and guidance of the government’s macro policies, the Company expects to further replicate its successful business model into new high growth regions through strategic selection of project locations, a short project development schedule characterized by fast asset turnover and excellent execution ability, as well as innovative product offering closely in line with market demand. The Company aims at becoming a leading large-scale residential property developer in Western China and a well-recognized brand name.

Pre-Sales and Sales
 
In the PRC, real estate developers are allowed to begin to market properties before construction is completed. Like other developers, we pre-sell properties prior to completion of construction. Under PRC pre-sales regulations, property developers must satisfy specific conditions before properties under construction can be pre-sold. These mandatory conditions include:
 

· | the land premium must have been paid in full;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | the land use rights certificate, the construction site planning permit, the construction work planning permit and the construction permit must have been obtained; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | at least 25% of the total project development cost must have been incurred;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the progress and the expected completion and delivery date of the construction must be fixed;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the pre-sale permit must have been obtained; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | the completion of certain milestones in the construction processes must be specified by the local government authorities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These mandatory conditions are designed to require a certain level of capital expenditure and substantial progress in project construction before the commencement of pre-sales. Generally, the local governments also require developers and property purchasers to have standard pre-sale contracts prepared under the auspices of the government. Developers are required to file all pre-sale contracts with local land bureaus and real estate administrations after entering into such contracts.
 
After-Sale Services and Delivery
 
We assist customers in arranging for and providing information related to financing. We also assist our customers in various title registration procedures related to their properties, and we have set up an ownership certificate team to assist purchasers to obtain their property ownership certificates. We offer various communication channels to customers to facilitate customer feedback collection. We also cooperate with property management companies that manage our properties and ancillary facilities, to handle customer feedback.
 
We endeavor to deliver the units to our customers on a timely basis. We closely monitor the progress of construction of our property projects and conduct pre-delivery property inspections to ensure timely delivery. The time frame for delivery is set out in the sale and purchase agreements entered into with our customers, and we are subject to penalty payments to the purchasers for any delay in delivery caused by us. The Company has never incurred any delay penalties. Once a property development has been completed, has passed the requisite government inspections and is ready for delivery, we will notify our customers and hand over keys and possession of the properties.
 
Marketing and Distribution Channel
 
We maintain a marketing and sales force for our development projects, which at September 30, 2018 consisted of 80 employees specializing in marketing and sales. We also train and use outside real estate agents to market and increase the public awareness of our projects, and spread the acceptance and influence of our brand. However, our marketing and sales are primarily conducted by our own sales force because we believe our own dedicated sales representatives are better motivated to serve our customers as well as to control our property pricing and selling expenses.

Our marketing and sales team develops the appropriate advertising and selling plan for each project. We develop public awareness through marketing and advertising as well as referrals from customers. We utilize a customer relationship management system to track customer profiles, which helps us to forecast future customer requirements and general demand for our projects. This allows us to have real-time information on the status of individual customer transactions as well as available inventory by project, which enables us to better anticipate the preferences of current and future customers.
 
We use various advertising media to market our developments and enhance our brand name, including newspapers, magazines, television, radio, e-marketing and outdoor billboards. We also participate in real estate exhibitions.
 
We have also developed a strong relationship with local institutional purchasers and governments. The Company has entered into various significant residential-apartment group-purchase agreements with local government and institutional purchasers.
 
A typical real estate property sales transaction usually consists of three steps. First, the customer pays a deposit to the Company. Within a week, after paying the deposit, the customer will sign a purchase contract with us and make a down payment to us in cash. After making the down payment, the customer arranges for a mortgage loan for the balance of the purchase price. Once the loan is approved, the mortgage loan proceeds are paid to us directly by the bank. Finally, we deliver the property to the customer. Legal title, as evidenced by a property ownership certificate issued by local land and construction bureaus, will be delivered to the customer in 12 months from the property delivery date.
 
For customers purchasing properties with mortgage financing, under current PRC laws, their minimum down payment is 30% of the total purchase price for the purchase of the first self-use residential unit with total GFA of 90 square meters (about 970 square feet) or more on all existing units and those yet to be completed, and a down payment of 20% on the first residential units for self-use with total GFA of under 90 square meters. In order to mitigate the default risk, the Company requires from its homebuyer customers deposits ranging from 30% - 50% of the purchase price, which is higher than the percentage required by the government for the mortgage down payment. 
 
Like most real estate companies in China, we generally provide guarantees to mortgagee banks in respect of the mortgage loans provided to the purchasers of our properties up until completion of the registration of the mortgage with the relevant mortgage registration authorities. As of September 30, 2018 the Company had security deposits for these guarantees amounted to approximately $3.5 million. Guarantees for mortgages on residential properties are typically discharged when the individual property ownership certificates are issued. In our experience, the issuance of the individual property ownership certificates typically takes six to twelve months, so our mortgage guarantees typically remain outstanding for up to twelve months after we deliver the underlying property.

Our Property Development Operations
 
We have a systematic and standardized process of project development, which we implement through several well-defined phases. One critically significant portion of our process is the land acquisition process, which is segmented into three stages: (i) opportunity identification, (ii) initial planning and budgeting, and (iii) land use rights acquisition. The following diagram sets forth the key stages of our property development process.

Suppliers
 
Land Bank
 
In China, the supply of land is controlled by the government. Since the early 2000s, the real estate industry in China has been transitioning from an arranged system controlled by the PRC government to a more market-oriented system. At present, although the Chinese government still owns all urban land in China, land use rights with terms of up to 70 years can be granted to, owned or leased by, private individuals and companies.

Land - under planning and development
 
In May 2011, the Company entered into a development agreement with the local government. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will prepay the development cost of $17,428,655 (RMB 119,700,000) and the Company has the right to acquire the land use rights through public bidding. The prepaid development cost will be deducted from the final purchase price of the land use rights. As of September 30, 2018, a deposit of $2,912,056 (RMB 20,000,000) was paid by the Company (2017- $3,006,027). The local government is still in a slow process of re-zoning the property. The Company expects to make payment of the remaining development cost based on the government’s current work progress.
 
In August 2011, the Company entered into a land transfer agreement with Hanzhong Shijin Real Estate Development Limited (“Shijin”). Pursuant to the agreement, Shijin agreed to transfer certain land use rights to the Company for the total price of $6,624,927 (RMB 45,500,000). The Company has made the full payment and received the land use certificate in fiscal year 2013. As of then, the related security deposit balance has been reclassified as real estate under development – Shijin Project. The Company is still waiting for the government to issue the completion settlement report in order to start construction as of September 30, 2018.
 
All land transactions are required to be reported to and authorized by the local Bureau of Land and Natural Resources. With respect to real estate project design and construction services, the Company typically selects the lowest-cost provider based on quality selected through an open bidding process. Such service providers are numerous in China and the Company foresees no difficulties in securing alternative sources of services as needed.
 
Other Suppliers
 
The Company uses various suppliers in the construction of its projects. For the year ended September 30, 2018, one constructor accounted for 10.8% of the total project expenditures. There was none for the year ended September 30, 2017.
Competition
 
The real estate industry in China is highly competitive. In the Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties that we focus on, the markets are relatively more fragmented than in the Tier 1 or Tier 2 cities. We compete primarily with regional property developers and an increasing number of large national property developers who have also started to enter these markets. Competitive factors include the geographical location of the projects, the types of products offered, brand recognition, price, designing and quality. In the regional markets in which we operate, our major competitors include regional real estate developers Wanbang Real Estate Development Co. Ltd., (“Wanbang”), Jingtai Real Estate Development Co. Ltd., (“Jingtai”) and Shaanxi Fenghui Real Estate Development Co. Ltd., (“Fenghui”) as well as other national real estate developers such as Evergrande Real Estate Group (“Evergrande”) who have also started their projects in these local markets.
 
Nationally, there are numerous national real estate developers that have real estate projects across China. There are many housing and land development companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. However, such companies usually undertake large scale projects and are unlikely to compete with the Company for business as the Company targets small to medium sized projects in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties.
 
In the regional market, the Company’s only direct competitor with meaningful market share in the market is Wanbang. This company generally undertakes medium and small scale projects and focuses on development of commercial real estate properties, such as hotels and shopping centers.
 
Competitive Strength:
 
We believe the following strengths allow us to compete effectively:
 
10

 

Well Positioned to Capture Opportunities in Tier 3 and Tier 4 Cities and Counties.
 
With the increase in consumer disposable income and urbanization rates, a growing middle-income consumer market has emerged driving demand for affordable and high quality housing in many cities across northwest China. We focus on building large communities of modern, mid-sized residential properties for this market segment and have accumulated substantial knowledge and experience about the residential preferences and demands of mid-income customers. We believe we can leverage our experience to capture the growth opportunities in the markets.
Standardized and Scalable Business Model. 
 
Our business model focuses on a standardized property development process designed for rapid asset turnover. We break up the overall process into well-defined stages and closely monitor costs and development schedules through each stage. These stages include (i) identifying land, (ii) pre-planning and budgeting, (iii) land acquisition, (iv) detailed project design, (v) construction management, (vi) pre-sales, sales and (vii) after-sale service. We commence pre-planning and budgeting prior to the land acquisition, which enables us to acquire land at costs that meet our pre-set investment targeted returns and to quickly begin the development process upon acquisition. Our enterprise resource planning enables us to collect and analyze information on a real-time basis throughout the entire property development process. We utilize our customer relationship management system to track customer profiles and sales to forecast future individual preferences and market demand.
Experienced Management Team Supported by Trained and Motivated Workforce. 
 
Our CEO and founder, Mr. Xiaojun Zhu has over 20 years of experience in the real estate industry and has gained considerable strategic planning and business management expertise in the past decade. Our management and workforce are well-trained and motivated. Employees receive on-going training in their areas of specialization at our head office in Hanzhong.
 
Guangsha is also an “AAA Enterprise in Shaanxi Construction Industry” as recognized by the Credit Association of Agricultural Bank of China, Shaanxi Branch.
 
Strategies
 
Our goal is to become the leading residential property developer focused on China’s Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties by implementing the following strategies:
 
Continue Expanding in Selected Tier 3 and Tier 4 Cities. We believe that Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties present development opportunities that are well suited for our scalable business model of rapid asset turnover. Furthermore, Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties currently tend to be in an early stage of market maturity and have fewer large national developers. We believe that the fragmented market and relative abundance of land supply in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities, as compared to Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, offer more opportunities for us to generate attractive margins. And we also believe that our experience affords us the opportunity to emerge as a leading developer in these markets. In the near future, we plan to enter into other Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities that have:

· | Increasing urbanization rates and population growth;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | High economic growth and increasing individual income; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | Sustainable land supply for future developments.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 
We plan to continue to closely monitor our capital and cash positions and carefully manage our cost for land use rights, construction costs and operating expenses. We believe that we will be able to use our working capital more efficiently by adhering to prudent cost management, which will help to maintain our profit margins. When selecting a property project for development, we will continue to follow our established internal evaluation process, including utilizing the analysis and input of our experienced management team and choosing third-party contractors through a tender process open only to bids which meet our budgeted costs.

Quality Control
 
We emphasize quality control to ensure that our buildings and residential units meet our standards and provide high quality service. We select only experienced design and construction companies. We, through our contracts with construction contractors, provide customers with warranties covering the building structure and certain fittings and facilities of our property developments in accordance with the relevant regulations. To ensure construction quality, our construction contracts contain quality warranties and penalty provisions for poor work quality. In the event of delay or poor work quality, the contractor may be required to pay pre-agreed damages under our construction contracts. Our construction contracts do not allow our contractors to subcontract or transfer their contractual arrangements with us to third parties. We typically withhold 2% of the agreed construction fees for two to five years after completion of the construction as security to guarantee quality, which provides us with assurance for our contractors’ work quality.
 
Our contractors are also subject to our quality control procedures, including examination of materials and supplies, on-site inspection and production of progress reports. We require our contractors to comply with relevant PRC laws and regulations, as well as our own standards and specifications. We set up a profile for each and every unit constructed and monitor the quality of such unit throughout its construction period until its delivery. We also employ independent surveyors to supervise the construction progress. In addition, the construction of real estate projects is regularly inspected and supervised by the PRC governmental authorities.

As a developer of property in the PRC, we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations set by the PRC national, provincial and municipal governments. These include regulations on air pollution, noise emissions, as well as water and waste discharge.  As of September 30, 2018 we have never paid any penalties associated with the breach of any such laws and regulations. Compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and we do not believe it will have such an impact in the future.
 
Our projects are normally required to undergo an environmental impact assessment by government-appointed third parties, and a report of such assessment needs to be submitted to the relevant environmental authorities in order to obtain their approval before commencing construction.
 
Upon completion of each project, the relevant environmental authorities inspect the site to ensure the applicable environmental standards have been complied with, and the resulting report is presented together with other specified documents to the relevant construction administration authorities for their approval and record. Approval from the environmental authorities on such report is required before we can deliver our completed work to our customers. As of September 30, 2018 we have not experienced any difficulties in obtaining those approvals for commencement of construction and delivery of completed projects.
