Business Strategy
 
Our business plan was developed with the overriding goal of maximizing shareholder value through the exploration and development of our mineral properties, utilizing the extensive mining-related background and capabilities of our management consultants and advisors. To achieve this goal, our business plan focuses on the following prospective areas: 
Mining Operations
 
We classify our mineral properties into three categories: “Development Properties”, “Advanced Exploration Properties”, and “Other Exploration Properties”. Development Properties are properties where a decision to develop the property into a producing mine has been made. Advanced Exploration Properties are those properties where we retain a significant ownership interest or joint venture and where there has been sufficient drilling and analysis to identify and report proven and probable reserves or other mineralized material. We currently do not have a Development Property or Advanced Exploration Property. Other Exploration Properties are those that do not fall into the other categories. Please see below for information about our Other Exploration Properties.
 
Effective March 31, 2011, we acquired Mexus Gold S.A. de C.V. (our wholly owned subsidiary) and began funding mining operations in Mexico. We have instituted a small placer processing operation to evaluate various areas of interest within the project lands.
 
Material Mining Properties
 
Santa Elena Prospect, (formerly known as the Caborca Project)
 
Our Santa Elena Prospect is comprised of early-stage exploration, including limited production operations, on the concessions. Under the terms of the concession agreement we also will acquire the associated surface. This concession is situated in the State of Sonora, Mexico. 
 
On April 16, 2018, Mexus Gold Mining S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of Mexus, announced that it planned to terminate its joint venture agreement with MarMar Holdings (the “JV Agreement”). The JV Agreement outlined the contractual obligations of the parties at the Santa Elena project in Caborca, Sonora State, Mexico. The decision to terminate the JV Agreement was made due to MarMar’s failure to provide agreed funding, equipment and general operations for the project, as well as MarMar’s inability to meet environmental standards at the site. We do not anticipate any early termination penalties associated with the JV Agreement. On July 2, 2018, the Company announced that the agreement was officially terminated.
 
We intend to move forward with the Santa Elena project with proper equipment and personnel. Due to the lack of funding by MarMar, the Santa Elena site, a disappointing 8.5oz Au was produced in the last 22 months. 
 
The Company has contracted with a security firm to provide 24-hour services at the Santa Elena site. Currently, there is equipment on site sufficient to produce an anticipated 500 tons a day and plans are in place to begin hiring staff with production beginning shortly thereafter. In addition, safety fencing will be installed and required site clean-up will occur that will satisfy any environmental concerns at the property. Two separate parties are running tests on the heap leach pad to determine the next steps to allow for recovery of gold and silver within the system. 
 
Using previously developed geological mapping the company plans to mine the Julio quartz vein and the adjacent shear zone via open pit mining. The existing Julio vein, with depths to 30 meters and widths from 1 to 4 meters, has values ranging from 1.5 to 186 grams Au per ton. The adjacent shear zone carries values from .5 to 17 grams Au per ton. Mexus estimates that the shear zone will average 2.5 grams per ton gold equivalent with the Julio vein values being much higher. Additional equipment will be purchased which will enable the company to increase production to 1000 tons a day and beyond. Mexus intends to announce a non-dilutive capital raise plan in the very near future.
 
Ures Property Prospects (also known as 8 brothers/370 mine project)
 
The Ures Prospects, also situated in the State of Sonora, Mexico are the 370 Prospect, San Ramon Prospect, La Platosa Prospect, Edgar Prospect, Edgar II Prospect, Los Lareles Prospect, El Scorpio Prospect, and Ocho Hermanos Prospect. 
 
In June 2018, Mexus completed its first test of the VAT leaching system and the Merrill Crowe gold recovery plant at the 8 brothers/370 mine project. The successful test produced 70 pounds of precipitate which is currently being dried and prepared for smelting. Results of this first run will be released soon. The material initially mined took longer to leach than expected. Mexus geologist, Cesar Lemas, has identified new material which has been column tested showing a 48 to 72 hour leach time. The company will mine and use this material going forward to accelerate recovery times.

Non-Material Mining Properties
 
San Felix Mine Project (formerly known as the Mexus-Trinidad Joint Venture)
 
In March, 2014, we sold our 50% interest in the Joint Venture to Atzek Mineral S.A. de C.V (“Atzek”). Atzek is currently in default of the sale agreement.
 
Effective January 13, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary, Mexus Gold Mining, S.A. de C.V., entered into a purchase agreement with Jesus Leopoldo Felix Mazon, Leonardo Elias Jaime Perez, and Elia Lizardi Perez, wherein we purchased a 50% interest in the “San Felix” mining site located in the La Alameda area of Caborca, State of Sonora, Mexico. The remaining 50% of the site is owned jointly by Mar Holdings S.A. de C.V. and Marco Antonio Martinez Mora. The San Felix mining site contains seven (7) concessions over an area of approximately 26,000 acres. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded an impairment of mineral property for the San Felix Project of $75,000 because the requirement payment of $500,000 due on August 13, 2017 was not paid in accordance with the purchase agreement pending the receipt of certain required instruments from the Grantor by the Company.
 
Other Operations
 
Cable Salvage Operation
 
The Company completed the first phase of its Cable Recovery Project in Alaskan waters. The cable which was recovered was smaller diameter cable which was excellent for testing the recovery equipment and vessels. The Company evaluated the project and conducted a mapping project and exploration activities in an attempt to identify larger cable. 
 
At March 31, 2017, the Company ceased cable salvage operations in order to fully concentrate on Mexico operations.
 
Mergers and Acquisitions
 
We will routinely review merger and acquisition opportunities. An appropriate merger and acquisition opportunity must be accretive to the overall value of Mexus Gold US. Our primary focus will be on those opportunities involving precious metal production or near-term production with a secondary focus on other resource-based opportunities. Potential acquisition targets would include private and public companies or individual properties. Although our preference would be for candidates located in the United States and Mexico; Mexus Gold US will consider opportunities located in other countries where the geopolitical risk is acceptable. 
Description of Mining Projects
 
The following properties are located in Mexico and owned by Mexus Gold S.A. de C.V., our wholly owned subsidiary:
 
Santa Elena Prospects (formerly known as the Caborca Project)
 
The Company executed a revised Mineral Mining and Purchase Agreement, dated December 3, 2015, with the Concession Owners covering 2,225 acres located in the State of Sonora, Mexico. The Agreement is for a term of 25 years and specifies a purchase privilege, at the discretion of the Company, for all concessions in the amount of $2,000,000 absent the exercise of the purchase privilege a royalty of 40% for lode deposits and 25% for placer deposits and is credited to the purchase price. The Agreement specifies a delayed monthly royalty in the amount of $1,000 and the payment of the semi-annual concession tax.

The Company has conducted geological evaluation of the Santa Elena Prospects comprised of expanding the existing placer facility for the purpose of mineral evaluation, physical geological evaluations including the drilling of reverse circulation and core holes. Situated on the prospect area are caterpillars, haul trucks, maintenance trucks, power generators, pumps, tractor blade, truck mounted winch, water handling supplies and maintenance trailer with supplies. The prospect area is accessed from a state highway on existing roads. There is access to well water which is available for the current and future operations.
 
On January 5, 2011, Mexus Gold Mining S.A. de C.V. entered into a Purchase Agreement to purchase the Santa Elena Prospect, formerly known as the Caborca Project. The Santa Elena Prospect consists of 7,400 acres (3,000 hectares) about 50 kilometers northwest of the City of Caborca, Sonora State, Mexico. The Caborca Project lies on claims filed by the owners of the Santa Elena Ranch, which controls the surface rights over the project claims. The claims lie near 112o 25' W, 31o 7.5" N. These claims were visited near the end of January, 2011. On or about July 11, 2011, we acquired five additional claims surrounding the Santa Elena Prospect consisting of approximately 1,000 additional acres. 
 
We have been unable to locate geologic maps of the area from the Government Geological Survey. However, pursuant to our investigation of the project, the claims were found to be underlain by an igneous complex. The rocks observed included many types of granitic rocks, exhibiting porphyrytic textures, gneissic and equigrannular textures. Quartz was variable. At times quartz "eyes" were observed, that is porphyrytic quartz which many workers consider to be indicative of a porphyry environment. In other localities, no quartz was evident. When no quartz was present, the rock was equigrannular. Quartz veining was evident throughout the claim group. A mine was developed along a major quartz vein, called the Julio 2 Mine with the vein being called the Julio Vein. 
 
There are multiple exploration targets on the Santa Elena Prospect. The two most important are the quartz stockwork zone and the Julio vein system. The first target will be the quartz stockwork zone area. A limited drilling program has been conducted and completed. Production testing has been completed resulting in the construction of the surface production and recovery facilities.
 
Access to the Santa Elena prospect is via dirt road approximately two miles west of paved highway Mexico 1 and approximately 34 miles northwest of the town of Caborca, Sonora, Mexico.

Exhibit 99.1 – PRELIMINARY REPORT AND FIRST STAGE MAPPING
 
Ures Property Prospects, being comprised of the following projects:
 
Ocho Hermanos – Guadalupe de Ures Project
 
The Guadalupe de Ures Project is accessed from Hermosillo by driving via good paved road for 60 kilometers to the town of Guadalupe de Ures and then for 15 kilometers over dirt roads to the prospects. A base camp has been established near the town of Guadalupe de Ures using mainly trailers for accommodation, workshops and kitchen facilities.

The Ocho Hermanos Project (also called the Guadalupe de Ures Project) consists of the “Ocho Hermanos” and "San Ramon" claims which are covered by the Sales and Production Contract dated the 4th day of July, 2009 between “Minerales Ruta Dorado de RL de CV” (seller) and “Mexus Gold Mining S.A. de C.V.”, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mexus Gold US (buyer). The Ocho Hermanos Claim consists of 34.9940 hectares (1 acre = 0.4047 hectares) or 86.4690 acres while the San Ramon Claim consists of 80 hectares (197.6773 acres).(Figure 4).
 
The initial term of the agreement was 5 years. During the term Mexus must pay 40% of the net revenue received for minerals produced to the seller. At the conclusion of the 5 years, the lease could be purchased for USD 50,000. Upon expiration on July 4, 2014, Mexus renewed the agreement with an indefinite term. The renewed agreement requires Mexus to pay $1,500 per month and 20% to the total proceeds upon a sale of the rights.
 
Minerales Ruta Dorado de RL de CV is a duly constituted Mexican Company and as such can hold mining claims in Mexico.
 


FIGURE 3 - OCHO HERMANOS
 PROJECT AREA CLAIM MAP
 
We did not perform any systematic sampling or any systematic drilling and because of this did not set up a formal QA/QC program. All of the samples were submitted to Certified Laboratories (ALS - Chemex in Hermosillo or American Assay in Reno, Nevada) which insert their own QA/QC samples/duplicates. Also the laboratories run duplicates and blanks from each batch fired. The sequence of events so far are the following:
 
We located a previously mined area with interesting values – Ocho Hermanos. Mexus began to submit characterization samples to the above noted assay laboratories, in order to determine the range of Au - Ag values present. Mexus then began an investigation into recovery options by using material taken from the areas with the better values.
 
The above work was completed before any systematic exploration was done because if no recovery method could be found relatively quickly, the project would move more slowly because of the lead time involved. Mexus began work on an Environmental Impact Statement for the likely operational area (a total of 4 hectares to begin). In order to complete the EIS, figures for estimated tonnages were submitted to cover the hoped for volume. To date, no suitable recovery method was found due primarily to the partial oxidation of the principally sulfide deposit.
 
The Environmental Permits run for 35 years so there is time for further investigation.

The main geologic feature of this project area is an apparent “manto” sulfide zone composed primarily of galena with some pyrite, arsenopyrite and possibly phyrrotite. Above this zone there is an oxide zone composed of iron and lead oxides. The sulfides themselves are partially oxidized. Reconnaissance and characterization samples taken indicated sporadically high gold and silver values. The deposit occurs in shallow water sediments (principally quartzites, with some limestone and shales) and can be best characterized as a skarn type deposit due to the presence of intrusive rocks within 1 kilometer. 
 
Given the complex nature of the sulfide deposit and the partial oxidization of the material (indicated by the presence of yellow colored lead oxides), a satisfactory recovery method has not yet been found. Consequently, at this time, no further systematic work beyond the initial reconnaissance and characterization sampling has been completed. The entire project was essentially put on hold until a suitable recovery method is found, which is a continuing effort and at this time is being pursued by a member of the faculty at the University of Sonora in Hermosillo. The faculty member teaches metallurgy and assay practices at the University. After a suitable recovery method has been identified, the process will need to be confirmed by a certified metallurgical testing laboratory.
 
The Environmental Permits detail all of the affected flora and fauna. The land is presently used for cattle grazing and the surface rights are owned by the community of Guadelupe de Ures. An agreement is in place with Mexus Gold Mining S.A. de C.V. for surface access and disturbance. The Environmental Permit concludes that no permanent damage or degradation of the present land use will result from the intended activity on the lands. At present, the Environmental Permits cover a total of 4 hectares - 3 hectares cover the initial site of the mineral as presently understood and 1 hectare is permitted for the erection of a suitable extraction plant. 
 
No known contamination from past mining activities was found or is known to locals. The historic workings consisted of a few shallow adits and pits. In the course of obtaining the Environmental Permission the permit stipulated that properly lined ponds etc. must be used to prevent any potential surface or ground water contamination from any proposed activities. 
 
Only separation is proposed to be conducted on site if found to be possible, while final metal recovery will be conducted at a properly licensed and certified metal refining facility. Current efforts to find suitable recovery methods are being conducted off site in a University laboratory. Up sizing the process, if found, will be completed by a licensed, certified metallurgical laboratory.
 
Figures of the proposed permitted sites are attached. These were extracted from the environmental permit Application.

 AREA DE EXTRACCION
 
370 Area Project
 
This zone is composed of a sedimentary sequence (limestone, quartzite, shale) intruded by dacite and diorite as well as rhyolite. The dacite exhibits argillic alterations as well as silicification (quartz veins). The entire area is well oxidized on the surface. This is an area of classic disseminated low grade gold and silver mineralization. Surface grab sample assays show 0.14 grams per ton to as high as 29.490 grams per ton gold. This area is an important area for potentially defining an open pit heap leach project.
El Scorpion Project Area
 
This area has several shear zones and veins which show copper and gold mineralization. Recent assays of an 84’ drill hole shows 1.750% per ton to .750% per ton of copper and 3.971 grams per ton to 0.072 grams per ton of gold. Another assay of rock sample from the area shows greater than 4.690% per ton copper. This land form distribution appears to be synonymous to the ideal porphyry deposit at Baja La Alumbrera, Argentina.
Los Laureles
 
Los Laureles is a vein type deposit mainly gold with some silver and copper. Recent assays from grab samples show gold values of 67.730 grams per ton gold, 38.4 grams per ton silver, 2,800 grams per ton copper.

10



As of the date of this Report, we have opened up old workings at the Los Laureles claim and have discovered a gold carrying vein running north and south into the mountain to the south. 
 
The San Felix Mine Project
 
The San Felix mining site contains seven (7) concessions over an area of approximately 26,000 acres located in the La Alameda area of Caborca, Sonora, Mexico. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded an impairment of mineral property for the San Felix Project of $75,000 because the requirement payment of $500,000 due on August 13, 2017 was not paid in accordance with the purchase agreement pending the receipt of certain required instruments from the Grantor by the Company.
Employees 
 
We have no employees at this time in the United States and Mexico. Consultants with specific skills are utilized to assist with various aspects of the requirements of activities such as project evaluation, property management, due diligence, acquisition initiatives, corporate governance and property management. If we complete our planned activation of the operations of the Mexican mining properties, our total workforce will be approximately 20 persons. Mr. Paul D. Thompson is our sole officer and director.
Competition 
 
We compete with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of gold properties. There is competition for the limited number of gold acquisition opportunities, some of which is with companies having substantially greater financial resources than Mexus Gold US. As a result, Mexus Gold US may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices. 
 
Management of Mexus Gold US believes that no single company has sufficient market power to affect the price or supply of gold in the world market. 
 
Legal Proceedings 
 
There are no legal proceedings to which Mexus Gold US or Mexus Gold S.A. de C.V. is a party or of which any of our properties are the subject thereof.
Property Interests, Mining Claims and Risk
 
Property Interests and Mining Claims 
 
 Our exploration activities and operations in Mexico are subject to the rules and regulations of the United Mexican States. The Ministry (Secretariat) of Mining is the Federal Mexican Government ministry charged with controlling all mining matters. A concession is granted on the acceptance of an application which identifies the specific minerals to be mined and description of the exact location of the lands to be mined. The concession is subject to a semiannual tax to continue the concession in good standing. Usually, our arrangements with a concessionaire describe specific period payments to the concessionaire and a royalty on the minerals recovered from mining operations. Where prospective mineral properties are identified by the Company, some type of conveyance of the mining rights and property acquisition agreement is necessary in order for us to explore or develop such property. Generally, these agreements take the form of long term mineral leases under which we acquire the right to explore and develop the property in exchange for periodic cash payments during the exploration and development phase and a royalty, usually expressed as a percentage of gross production or net profits derived from the leased properties if and when mines on the properties are brought into production. Other forms of acquisition agreements are exploration agreements coupled with options to purchase and joint venture agreements. 
Reclamation 
 
We may be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. 
 
While the Company, as of March 31, 2019, does not have a legal obligation associated with the disposal of certain chemicals used in its leaching process, the Company estimates it will incur costs up to $50,000 to neutralize those chemicals at the close of the leaching pond.

11



Risk
 
Our success depends on our ability to recover precious metals, process them, and successfully sell them for more than the cost of production. The success of this process depends on the market prices of metals in relation to our costs of production. We may not always be able to generate a profit on the sale of gold or other minerals because we can only maintain a level of control over our costs and have no ability to control the market prices. The total cash costs of production at any location are frequently subject to great variation from year to year as a result of a number of factors, such as the changing composition of ore grade or mineralized material production, and metallurgy and exploration activities in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body or deposit. In addition costs are affected by the price of commodities, such as fuel and electricity. Such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. A material increase in production costs or a decrease in the price of gold or other minerals could adversely affect our ability to earn a profit on the sale of gold or other minerals. Our success depends on our ability to produce sufficient quantities of precious metals to recover our investment and operating costs. 
 
Distribution Methods of the Products
 
The end product of our operations will usually be doré bars. Doré is an alloy consisting of gold, silver and other precious metals. Doré is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% pure gold. Under the terms of refining agreements we expect to execute, the doré bars are refined for a fee and our share of the refined gold, silver and other metals are credited to our account or delivered to our buyers who will then use the refined metals for fabrication or held for investment purposes. 
 
General Market
 
The general market for gold has two principal categories, being fabrication and investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry. The supply of gold consists of a combination of current production from mining and the draw-down of existing stocks of gold held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals. 
 
Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements, or labor contracts, including duration;
 
We do not have any designs or equipment which is copyrighted, trademarked or patented.
 
Effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business
 
Government Regulation 
 
Mining operations and exploration activities in Mexico are subject to the Ministry of Mining federal laws and regulations which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and other programs. We believe that Mexus Gold US is in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder any jurisdiction in which we will operate. We are not aware of any current orders or directions relating to Mexus Gold US with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. 
Environmental Regulation
 
Our gold projects are subject to various Mexican federal laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. It is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that the actions and operations of Mexus Gold US will be conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Changes to current Mexican federal laws and regulations where we operate currently, or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future, could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects. 
Research and Development
 
We do not foresee any immediate future research and development costs.

Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws
 
Our gold projects are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. It is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are and will be conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The economics of our current projects consider the costs and expenses associated with our compliance policy.
 
Changes to current state or federal laws and regulations in Mexico, where we operate currently, or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future, could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.
