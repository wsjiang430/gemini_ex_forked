Company Overview 
 Home BancShares, Inc. (Home BancShares, which may also be referred to in this document as we, us, HBI or the Company) is a Conway, Arkansas headquartered bank holding company registered under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Companys common stock is traded through the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol HOMB. We are primarily engaged in providing a broad range of commercial and retail banking and related financial services to businesses, real estate developers and investors, individuals and municipalities through our wholly owned community bank subsidiary  Centennial Bank. Centennial Bank has branch locations in Arkansas, Florida, South Alabama and New York City. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, commercial real estate loans represented 58.1% and 61.8% of gross loans and 273.6% and 289.6% of total stockholders equity, respectively. The Companys total assets, total deposits, total revenue and net income for each of the past three years are as follows:

 Home BancShares acquires, organizes and invests in community banks that serve attractive markets. Our community banking team is built around experienced bankers with strong local relationships. The Company was formed in 1998 by an investor group led by John W. Allison, our Chairman, and Robert H. Bunny Adcock, Jr., our Vice Chairman. Since opening our first subsidiary bank in 1999, we have acquired and integrated a total of 22 banks with locations in Arkansas, Florida and Alabama, including 17 banks since 2010, seven of which we acquired through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) assisted transactions. Our subsidiary bank has operated under a single charter and the Centennial Bank name since 2009. In 2015, after acquiring a pool of national commercial real estate loans, we created Centennial Commercial Finance Group (Centennial CFG) to build out a national lending platform focused on commercial real estate as well as commercial and industrial loans. Centennial CFG operates out of our New York City branch office and loan production offices in Los Angeles, California and Dallas, Texas. On June 30, 2018, we acquired Shore Premier Finance (SPF), a marine-lending division of Union Bank & Trust of Richmond, Virginia, and established the SPF division of Centennial Bank to build out a lending platform focusing on commercial and consumer marine loans. In connection with the creation of the SPF division, Centennial Bank opened a loan production office in Chesapeake, Virginia.

 Acquisitions 
 We believe many individuals and businesses prefer banking with a locally managed community bank capable of providing flexibility and quick decisions. The execution of our community banking strategy has allowed us to rapidly build our network of banking operations through acquisitions. The following summary provides additional details concerning our acquisitions during the previous five fiscal years. 
 Florida Traditions Bank  On July 17, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Florida Traditions Bank (Traditions) and merged Traditions into Centennial Bank. Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 25, 2014, by and among Home BancShares, Centennial Bank, and Traditions, the shareholders of Traditions received approximately $39.5 million of the Companys common stock valued at the time of closing, in exchange for all outstanding shares of Traditions common stock. 
 Prior to the acquisition, Traditions operated eight banking locations in Central Florida, including its main office in Dade City, Florida. Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, Traditions had $310.5 million in total assets, $241.6 million in loans after $8.5 million of loan discounts, and $267.3 million in deposits. 
 Broward Financial Holdings, Inc.  On October 23, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Broward Financial Holdings, Inc. (Broward), parent company of Broward Bank of Commerce (Broward Bank), and merged Broward Bank into Centennial Bank. Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 30, 2014 by and among Home BancShares, Centennial Bank, Broward, Broward Bank and an acquisition subsidiary of Home BancShares, the shareholders of Broward received approximately $30.2 million of the Companys common stock valued as of the closing date, plus $3.3 million in cash, in exchange for all outstanding shares of Broward common stock. The Company also agreed to pay the Broward shareholders at an undetermined date up to approximately $751,000 in additional consideration, the amount and timing of which, if any, was dependent on future payments received or losses incurred by Centennial Bank from certain current Broward Bank loans. During the first quarter of 2016, we determined and reached an agreement with the Broward shareholders that no additional consideration was owed or would be paid to the Broward shareholders. 
 Prior to the acquisition, Broward Bank operated two banking locations in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, Broward had approximately $184.4 million in total assets, $121.1 million in total loans after $3.0 million of loan discounts, and $134.2 million in deposits. 
 Doral Banks Florida Panhandle Operations  On February 27, 2015, Centennial Bank acquired in an FDIC-assisted transaction all the deposits and substantially all the assets of the Florida Panhandle operations of Doral Bank of San Juan, Puerto Rico (Doral Florida) through an alliance agreement with Banco Popular of Puerto Rico (Popular), who was the successful lead bidder to acquire the assets and liabilities of the failed Doral Bank from the FDIC, as receiver for Doral Bank. Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, the acquisition provided the Company with loans of approximately $37.9 million net of loan discounts, deposits of approximately $467.6 million, plus a $428.2 million cash settlement to balance the transaction. The FDIC did not provide any loss-sharing with respect to these acquired assets. 
 Prior to the acquisition, Doral Florida operated five branch locations in Panama City, Panama City Beach and Pensacola, Florida plus a loan production office in Tallahassee, Florida. At the time of acquisition, Centennial operated 29 branch locations in the Florida Panhandle. As a result, the Company closed all five branch locations during the July 2015 systems conversion and returned the facilities back to the FDIC. 
 Pool of National Commercial Real Estate Loans  On April 1, 2015, Centennial Bank purchased a pool of national commercial real estate loans totaling approximately $289.1 million from AM PR LLC, an affiliate of J.C. Flowers & Co. (collectively, the Seller) for a purchase price of 99% of the total principal value of the acquired loans. The acquired loans were originated by the former Doral Bank within its Doral Property Finance portfolio and were transferred to the Seller by Popular upon its acquisition of the assets and liabilities of Doral Bank from the FDIC. This pool of loans is now managed by Centennial CFG, which is responsible for servicing the acquired loan pool and originating new loan production.

 In connection with this acquisition of loans, the Company opened a loan production office on April 23, 2015 in New York City, which became a full branch on September 1, 2016. 
 Florida Business BancGroup, Inc.  On October 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Florida Business BancGroup, Inc. (FBBI), parent company of Bay Cities Bank (Bay Cities). The Company paid a purchase price to the FBBI shareholders of $104.1 million for the FBBI acquisition. Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of FBBI received shares of the Companys common stock valued at approximately $83.8 million as of October 1, 2015, plus approximately $20.3 million in cash in exchange for all outstanding shares of FBBI common stock. A portion of the cash consideration, $2.0 million, was placed into escrow with the FBBI shareholders having a contingent right to receive their pro-rata portions of such amount. The amount, if any, of such escrowed funds to be released to FBBI shareholders would depend upon the amount of losses that the Company incurred in the two years following the completion of the merger related to two class action lawsuits that were pending against Bay Cities. In August 2017, the Company distributed the contingent cash consideration to the former FBBI shareholders, less $10,000 for compensation paid to a representative designated by FBBI who acted on behalf of the FBBI shareholders in connection with the escrow arrangements. 
 FBBI formerly operated six branch locations and a loan production office in the Tampa Bay area and in Sarasota, Florida. Including the effects of any purchase accounting adjustments, as of October 1, 2015, FBBI had approximately $564.5 million in total assets, $408.3 million in loans after $14.1 million of loan discounts, and $472.0 million in deposits. 
 Giant Holdings, Inc.  On February 23, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Giant Holdings, Inc. (GHI), parent company of Landmark Bank, N.A. (Landmark), pursuant to a definitive agreement and plan of merger whereby GHI merged with and into HBI and, immediately thereafter, Landmark merged with and into Centennial Bank. The Company paid a purchase price to the GHI shareholders of approximately $96.0 million for the GHI acquisition. Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of GHI received 2,738,038 shares of the Companys common stock valued at approximately $77.5 million as of February 23, 2017, plus approximately $18.5 million in cash in exchange for all outstanding shares of GHI common stock. 
 GHI formerly operated six branch locations in the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida area. Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, as of acquisition date, GHI had approximately $398.1 million in total assets, $327.8 million in loans after $8.1 million of loan discounts, and $304.0 million in deposits. 
 The Bank of Commerce  On February 28, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of The Bank of Commerce, a Florida state-chartered bank that operated in the Sarasota, Florida area (BOC), pursuant to an acquisition agreement, dated December 1, 2016, by and between HBI and Bank of Commerce Holdings, Inc. (BCHI), parent company of BOC. The Company merged BOC with and into Centennial Bank effective as of the close of business on February 28, 2017. 
 The acquisition of BOC was conducted in accordance with the provisions of Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) pursuant to a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code filed by BCHI with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida (the Bankruptcy Court). The sale of BOC by BCHI was subject to certain bidding procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court. On November 14, 2016, the Company submitted an initial bid to purchase the outstanding shares of BOC in accordance with the bidding procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court. An auction was subsequently conducted on November 16, 2016, and the Company was deemed to be the successful bidder. The Bankruptcy Court entered a final order on December 9, 2016 approving the sale of BOC to the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the acquisition agreement. 
 Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company paid an aggregate of approximately $4.2 million in cash for the acquisition, which included the purchase of all outstanding shares of BOC common stock, the discounted purchase of certain subordinated debentures issued by BOC from the existing holders of the subordinated debentures, and an expense reimbursement to BCHI for approved administrative claims in connection with the bankruptcy proceeding.

 BOC formerly operated three branch locations in the Sarasota, Florida area. Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, as of acquisition date, BOC had approximately $178.1 million in total assets, $118.5 million in loans after $5.8 million of loan discounts, and $139.8 million in deposits. 
 Stonegate Bank  On September 26, 2017, the Company, completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Stonegate Bank (Stonegate), and merged Stonegate into Centennial Bank. The Company paid a purchase price to the Stonegate shareholders of approximately $792.4 million for the Stonegate acquisition. Under the terms of the merger agreement, shareholders of Stonegate received 30,863,658 shares of HBI common stock valued at approximately $742.3 million at the time of closing plus approximately $50.1 million in cash in exchange for all outstanding shares of Stonegate common stock. In addition, the holders of outstanding stock options of Stonegate received approximately $27.6 million in cash in connection with the cancellation of their options immediately before the acquisition closed, for a total transaction value of approximately $820.0 million. 
 Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, as of acquisition date, Stonegate had approximately $2.89 billion in total assets, $2.37 billion in loans and $2.53 billion in customer deposits. Stonegate formerly operated its banking business from 24 locations in key Florida markets with significant presence in Broward and Sarasota counties. 
 Shore Premier Finance  On June 30, 2018, the Company, completed the acquisition of Shore Premier Finance (SPF), a division of Union Bank & Trust of Richmond, Virginia, the bank subsidiary of Union Bankshares Corporation. The Company paid a purchase price of approximately $377.4 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and 1,250,000 shares of HBI common stock valued at approximately $28.2 million at the time of the acquisition. SPF provides direct consumer financing for United States Coast Guard (USCG) registered high-end sail and power boats. Additionally, SPF provides inventory floor plan lines of credit to marine dealers, primarily those selling USCG documented vessels. 
 Including the purchase accounting adjustments, as of acquisition date, SPF had approximately $377.0 million in total assets, including $376.2 million in total loans, which resulted in goodwill of $30.5 million being recorded. 
 This portfolio of loans is now housed in a division of Centennial Bank known as Shore Premier Finance. The SPF division of Centennial Bank is responsible for servicing the acquired loan portfolio and originating new loan production. In connection with this acquisition, Centennial Bank has opened a new loan production office in Chesapeake, Virginia. Through the SPF division, Centennial Bank is working to build out a lending platform focusing on commercial and consumer marine loans.

 Our Growth Strategy 
 Our goals are to achieve growth in earnings per share and to create and build stockholder value. Our growth strategy entails the following: 
 

 | Strategic acquisitions  Strategic acquisitions (both FDIC-assisted and non-FDIC-assisted) have been a significant component of our historical growth strategy, and we believe properly priced bank acquisitions can continue to be a large part of our growth strategy. We anticipate that our principal acquisition focus will continue to be to expand our presence in Arkansas, Florida and Alabama and into other contiguous markets, although we may seek to expand into other areas if attractive financial opportunities in other market areas arise. We will continue to evaluate potential bank acquisition opportunities to determine whether they are in the best interests of our Company. Our goals in making these decisions are to maximize the return to our shareholders and to enhance our franchise.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Organic growth  We believe our current branch network provides us with the capacity to grow within our existing market areas. We also believe we are well positioned to attract new business and additional experienced personnel as a result of ongoing changes in our competitive markets. We believe the markets we entered into as a result of historical acquisitions provide us opportunities for organic growth as we now have a presence in several large markets where our market share has not previously been significant. Additionally, through our Centennial CFG franchise, we are continuing to build out a national lending platform that focuses on commercial real estate plus commercial and industrial loans. As opportunities arise, we will evaluate new (commonly referred to as de novo) branches in our current markets and in other attractive market areas. During 2018, two de novo branch locations were opened in Jonesboro and Russellville, Arkansas. During 2018, we also opened a loan production office in Dallas, Texas under the management of Centennial CFG. We will continue to evaluate de novo opportunities during 2019 and make decisions on a case-by-case basis in the best interest of the shareholders. Overall, we expect the organic loan growth we experienced during the last two years to continue in all of our markets as the economic environment has improved.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Community Banking Philosophy 
 Our community banking philosophy consists of four basic principles: 
 

 | manage our community banking franchise with experienced bankers and community bank boards who are empowered to make customer-related decisions quickly;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | provide exceptional service and develop strong customer relationships;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pursue the business relationships of our local boards of directors, executive officers, stockholders, and customers to actively promote our community bank; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | maintain our commitment to the communities we serve by supporting civic and nonprofit organizations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These principles, which make up our community banking philosophy, are the driving force for our business. As we streamlined our legacy business into an efficient banking network and have integrated new acquisitions, we have preserved lending authority with local management in most cases by using local loan committees that maintain an integral connection to the communities we serve. These committees are empowered with lending authority of up to $6.0 million in their respective geographic areas. This allows us to capitalize on the strong relationships that these individuals and our local bank officers have in their respective communities to maintain and grow our business. Through experienced and empowered local bankers and board members, we are committed to maintaining a community banking experience for our customers. 
 
10 


 Operating Goals 
 Our operating goals focus on maintaining strong credit quality, increasing profitability, finding experienced bankers, and maintaining a fortress balance sheet: 
 

 | Maintain strong credit quality  Credit quality is our first priority. We employ a set of credit standards designed to ensure the proper management of credit risk. Our management team plays an active role in monitoring compliance with these credit standards in the different communities served by Centennial Bank. We have a centralized loan review process, which we believe enables us to take prompt action on potential problem loans. During the past few years we have taken an aggressive approach to resolving problem loans, including those problem loans acquired in our FDIC-assisted and non-FDIC-assisted acquisitions. We are committed to maintaining high credit quality standards.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to improve profitability  We will continue to strive to improve our profitability and achieve high performance ratios as we continue to utilize the available capacity of branches and employees. As we work out problem loans in our special assets department, we plan to emphasize business development and relationship enhancement in lending and retail areas in our newly acquired markets. Our efficiency ratio has improved from 62.68% for the year ended 2008 to 38.48% for the year ended 2018. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis and non-interest income. Our efficiency ratio, as adjusted, has improved from 59.4% for the year ended 2008 to 37.7% for the year ended 2018. The efficiency ratio, as adjusted, is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income excluding certain adjustments such as merger expenses and/or gain and losses. These improvements in operating efficiency are being driven by, among other factors, increasing revenue from organic loan growth, improving our cost savings from the acquisitions, implementing our efficiency study initiatives, streamlining the processes in our lending and retail operations and improving our purchasing power.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Attract and motivate experienced bankers  We believe a major factor in our success has been our ability to attract and motivate bankers who have experience in and knowledge of their local communities. Historically, our hiring and retaining experienced relationship bankers has been integral to our ability to grow quickly when entering new markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Maintain a fortress balance sheet  We intend to maintain a strong balance sheet through a focus on four key governing principles: (1) maintain solid asset quality; (2) remain well-capitalized; (3) pursue high performance metrics including return on tangible equity (ROTE), return on assets (ROA), efficiency ratio and net interest margin; and (4) retain liquidity at the bank holding company level that can be utilized should attractive acquisition opportunities be identified or for internal capital needs. We strive to maintain capital levels above the regulatory capital requirements through our focus on these governing principles, which historically has allowed us to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they become available without the need for additional capital.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Market Areas 
 As of December 31, 2018, we conducted business principally through 77 branches in Arkansas, 76 branches in Florida, five branches in Alabama and one branch in New York City. Our branch footprint includes markets in which we are the deposit market share leader as well as markets where we believe we have opportunities for deposit market share growth. As of December 31, 2018, we also operate loan production offices in Los Angeles, California and Dallas, Texas through our Centennial CFG division and in Chesapeake, Virginia through our SPF division.

 Lending Activities 
 We originate loans primarily secured by single and multi-family real estate, residential construction and commercial buildings. In addition, we make loans to small and medium-sized commercial businesses as well as to consumers for a variety of purposes. 
 Our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018, was comprised as follows:

Total | $ | 11,071,879 | | 100.0 | %

 Real Estate  Non-farm/Non-residential. Non-farm/non-residential real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by income-producing properties, such as shopping/retail centers, hotel/motel properties, office buildings, and industrial/warehouse properties. Commercial lending on income-producing properties typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties collateralizing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. This category of loans also includes specialized properties such as churches, marinas, and nursing homes. Additionally, we make commercial mortgage loans to entities to operate in these types of properties, and the repayment of these loans is dependent, in large part, on the cash flow generated by these entities in the operations of the business. Often, a secondary source of repayment will include the sale of the subject collateral. When this is the case, it is generally our practice to obtain an independent appraisal of this collateral within the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines. 
 Real Estate  Construction/Land Development. This category of loans includes loans to residential and commercial developers to purchase raw land and to develop this land into residential and commercial land developments. In addition, this category includes construction loans for all of the types of real estate loans, including both commercial and residential. These loans are generally secured by a first lien on the real estate being purchased or developed. Often, the primary source of repayment will be the sale of the subject collateral. When this is the case, it is generally our practice to obtain an independent appraisal of this collateral within the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines. 
 Real Estate  Residential. Our residential mortgage loan program primarily originates loans to individuals for the purchase of residential property. We generally do not retain long-term, fixed-rate residential real estate loans in our portfolio due to interest rate and collateral risks. Residential mortgage loans to individuals retained in our loan portfolio primarily consisted of approximately 30.2% owner occupied 1-4 family properties and approximately 58.7% non-owner occupied 1-4 family properties (rental) as of December 31, 2018 with the remaining 11.1% relating to condos and mobile homes. The primary source of repayment for these loans is generally the income and/or assets of the individual to whom the loan is made. Often, a secondary source of repayment will include the sale of the subject collateral. When this is the case, it is generally our practice to obtain an independent appraisal of this collateral within the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines. 
 
12 


 Consumer. While our focus is on service to small and medium-sized businesses, we also make a variety of loans to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including secured and unsecured installment and term loans originated by our bank, the primary portion of which consists of loans to finance USCG registered high-end sail and power boats as a result of our acquisition of SPF on June 30, 2018. The primary source of repayment for these loans is generally the income and/or assets of the individual to whom the loan is made. The performance of consumer loans will be affected by the local and regional economies as well as the rates of personal bankruptcies, job loss, divorce and other individual-specific characteristics. When secured, we may independently assess the value of the collateral using a third-party valuation source. 
 Commercial and Industrial. Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio primarily consisted of 52.1% inventory/accounts receivable financing, 12.0% equipment/vehicle financing and 35.9% other, including letters of credit at less than 1%, as of December 31, 2018. This category includes loans to smaller business ventures, credit lines for working capital and short-term inventory financing, for example. These loans are typically secured by the assets of the business and are supplemented by personal guaranties of the principals and often mortgages on the principals primary residences. The primary source of repayment may be conversion of the assets into cash flow, as in inventory and accounts receivable, or may be cash flow generated by operations, as in equipment/vehicle financing. Assessing the value of inventory can involve many factors including, but not limited to, type, age, condition, level of conversion and marketability, and can involve applying a discount factor or obtaining an independent valuation, based on the assessment of the above factors. Assessing the value of accounts receivable can involve many factors including, but not limited to, concentration, aging, and industry, and can involve applying a discount factor or obtaining an independent valuation, based on the assessment of the above factors. Assessing the value of equipment/vehicles may involve a third-party valuation source, where applicable. 
 Agricultural Loans. Agricultural loans include loans for financing agricultural production, including loans to businesses or individuals engaged in the production of timber, poultry, livestock or crops and are not categorized as part of real estate loans. Our agricultural loans are generally secured by farm machinery, livestock, crops, vehicles or other agricultural-related collateral. A portion of our portfolio of agricultural loans is comprised of loans to individuals which would normally be characterized as consumer loans except for the fact that the individual borrowers are primarily engaged in the production of timber, poultry, livestock or crops. 
 Credit Risks. The principal economic risk associated with each category of the loans that we make is the creditworthiness of the borrower and the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. General economic conditions and the strength of the services and retail market segments affect borrower creditworthiness. General factors affecting a commercial borrowers ability to repay include interest rates, inflation and the demand for the commercial borrowers products and services as well as other factors affecting a borrowers customers, suppliers and employees. 
 Risks associated with real estate loans also include fluctuations in the value of real estate, new job creation trends, tenant vacancy rates, and in the case of commercial borrowers, the quality of the borrowers management. Consumer loan repayments depend upon the borrowers financial stability and are more likely to be adversely affected by divorce, job loss, illness and other personal hardships. 
 
13 


 Lending Policies. We have established common loan documentation procedures and policies, based on the type of loan, for our bank subsidiary. The board of directors periodically reviews these policies for validity. In addition, it has been and will continue to be our practice to attempt to independently verify information provided by our borrowers, including assets and income. We have not made loans similar to those commonly referred to as no doc or stated income loans. We focus on the primary and secondary methods of repayment, and prepare global cash flows where appropriate. There are legal restrictions on the dollar amount of loans available for each lending relationship. The Arkansas Banking Code provides that no loan relationship may exceed 20% of a banks risk-based capital, and we are in compliance with this restriction. In addition, we are not dependent upon any single lending relationship for an amount exceeding 10% of our revenues. As of December 31, 2018, the maximum amount outstanding to a single borrower was $172.7 million. As a community lender, we believe from time to time it is in our best interest to agree to modifications or restructurings. These modifications/restructurings can take the form of a reduction in interest rate, a move to interest-only from principal and interest payments, or a lengthening in the amortization period or any combination thereof. Occasionally, we will modify/restructure a single loan by splitting it into two loans following the interagency guidance involving the workout of commercial real estate loans. The loan representing the portion that is supported by the current cash flow of the borrower or project will remain on our books, while the new loan representing the portion that cannot be serviced by the current cash flow is charged-off. Furthermore, we may make an additional loan or loans to a borrower or related interest of a borrower who is past due more than 90 days. These circumstances will be very limited in nature, and when approved by the appropriate lending authority, will likely involve obtaining additional collateral that will improve the collectability of the overall relationship. It is our belief that judicious usage of these tools can improve the quality of our loan portfolio by providing our borrowers an improved probability of survival during difficult economic times. 
 Loan Approval Procedures. Our bank subsidiary has supplemented our common loan policies to establish its loan approval procedures as follows: 
 

 | Individual Authorities. The board of directors of Centennial Bank establishes the authorization levels for individual loan officers on a case-by-case basis. Generally, the more experienced a loan officer, the higher the authorization level. The approval authority for individual loan officers ranges from $10,000 to $2.5 million for secured loans and from $1,000 to $100,000 for unsecured loans.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Officers Loan Committees. Our bank subsidiary also gives its Officers Loan Committees loan approval authority. Credits in excess of individual loan limits are submitted to the regions Officers Loan Committee. The Officers Loan Committee consists of members of the senior management team of that region and is chaired by that regions chief lending officer. The regional Officers Loan Committees have approval authority of up to $2.0 million secured on all loans and $100,000 unsecured on loan renewals.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Directors Loan Committee. Our bank subsidiary has Directors Loan Committees (DLCs) throughout our market areas consisting of outside directors and senior lenders of the respective market areas. Generally, each DLC requires a majority of outside directors be present to establish a quorum. Generally, this committee is chaired either by the Division Chief Lending Officer or the Regional President. The regional DLCs have approval authority up to $6.0 million secured and $3.0 million unsecured.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Executive Loan Committee  The board of directors of Centennial Bank established the Executive Loan Committee consisting of three outside board members and members of executive management. This committee requires five voting members to establish a quorum, including at least two of the outside board members, and is chaired by the Chief Lending Officer of the bank. The Executive Loan Committee has approval authority up to the in-house consolidated lending limit of $20.0 million.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Currently, our board of directors has established an in-house consolidated lending limit of $20.0 million to any one borrowing relationship without obtaining the approval of both our Chairman and our director Richard H. Ashley. We have 106 separate relationships that exceed this in-house limit.

 Deposits and Other Sources of Funds 
 Our principal source of funds for loans and investing in securities is core deposits. We offer a wide range of deposit services, including checking, savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We obtain most of our deposits from individuals and small businesses, and municipalities in our market areas. We believe that the rates we offer for core deposits are competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in our market areas. Additionally, our policy also permits the acceptance of brokered deposits. Secondary sources of funding include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and other borrowings. These secondary sources enable us to borrow funds at rates and terms which, at times, are more beneficial to us. 
Other Banking Services 
 Given customer demand for increased convenience and account access, we offer a range of products and services, including 24-hour internet banking, mobile banking and voice response information, cash management, overdraft protection, direct deposit, safe deposit boxes, United States savings bonds and automatic account transfers. We earn fees for most of these services. We also receive ATM transaction fees from transactions performed by our customers participating in a shared network of automated teller machines and a debit card system that our customers can use throughout the United States, as well as in other countries. 
 As a result of our acquisition of Stonegate in September 2017, we also offer credit cards to both consumers and businesses. Credit cards typically involve a higher degree of credit risk since outstanding balances are unsecured and repayment of such balances is often negatively impacted by a decline in economic conditions. Our credit cards offer a variety of benefits and features designed to meet the needs of our customer. In addition, our consumer credit cards can be used in Cuba. 
 Insurance 
 Centennial Insurance Agency, Inc. is an independent insurance agency, originally founded in 1959 and purchased by Centennial Bank in 2000. Centennial Insurance Agency writes policies for commercial and personal lines of business including insurance for property, casualty, life, health and employee benefits. It is subject to regulation by the Arkansas Insurance Department. The offices of Centennial Insurance Agency are currently located in Jacksonville, Cabot and Conway, Arkansas. 
 Cook Insurance Agency, Inc. is an independent insurance agency, originally founded in 1913 and acquired by Centennial Bank in 2010 during our FDIC-assisted acquisition of Gulf State Community Bank. Cook Insurance Agency writes policies for commercial and personal lines of business including life insurance. It is subject to regulation by the Florida Insurance Department. The offices of Cook Insurance Agency are located in Apalachicola and Crawfordville, Florida.

 Competition 
 As of December 31, 2018, we conducted business through 159 branches in our primary market areas of Pulaski, Faulkner, Craighead, Lonoke, Pope, Washington, White, Benton, Greene, Sebastian, Cleburne, Independence, Stone, Baxter, Clay, Conway, Crawford, Johnson, Saline, Sharp and Yell counties in Arkansas; Broward, Monroe, Hillsborough, Leon, Sarasota, Bay, Franklin, Palm Beach, Gulf, Charlotte, Collier, Escambia, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Walton, Miami-Dade, Lee, Calhoun, Gadsden, Hernando, Liberty, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Seminole, Wakulla and Manatee counties in Florida; Baldwin County in Alabama; and New York County in New York. Many other commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions have offices in our primary market areas. These institutions include many of the largest banks operating in these respective states, including some of the largest banks in the country. Many of our competitors serve the same counties we do. Our competitors often have greater resources, have broader geographic markets, have higher lending limits, offer various services that we may not currently offer and may better afford and make broader use of media advertising, support services and electronic technology than we do. To offset these competitive disadvantages, we depend on our reputation as having greater personal service, consistency, and flexibility and the ability to make credit and other business decisions quickly. 
Employees 
 On December 31, 2018, we had 1,815 full-time equivalent employees. Except for any additional employees acquired in future acquisitions, we expect that our 2019 staffing levels will be slightly higher than those at year end 2018 to meet increased regulatory requirements resulting from exceeding $10 billion in assets. We consider our employee relations to be good, and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any employees. 
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 General 
 We and our bank subsidiary are subject to extensive state and federal banking regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of our company and its operations. These laws generally are intended to protect depositors, the deposit insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders. 
 The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to us. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. Also, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us and our subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because our bank subsidiarys total assets exceed $10 billion, it is subject to additional supervision and regulation, including by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), with such additional supervision and regulation discussed throughout this section. 
 Financial Regulatory Reform 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) made extensive changes in the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. Some of these provisions are described in more detail below. Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have delayed effective dates, and the legislation requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, some of which have not yet been issued in final form. In addition, we and our bank subsidiary became subject to certain Dodd-Frank Act provisions for the first time in 2018 as our bank subsidiarys total assets exceeded $10 billion. We expect our operating and compliance costs to continue to increase as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing its regulations.

 Home BancShares 
 We are a bank holding company registered under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the Bank Holding Company Act) and are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. The Bank Holding Company Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. 
 Acquisitions of Banks. The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve Boards prior approval before: 
 

 | acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the banks voting shares;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the Bank Holding Company Act, if well-capitalized and well managed, we, as well as other bank holding companies located within the states in which we operate, may purchase a bank located outside of those states. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well managed bank holding company located outside of the states in which we operate may purchase a bank located inside those states. In each case, however, restrictions may be placed on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in specified concentrations of deposits. In approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve Board is required to consider, among other things, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and various competitive factors. 
 Permitted Activities. A bank holding company is generally permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities: 

 | banking or managing or controlling banks; and
--+----------------------------------------------


 | any activity that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Activities that the Federal Reserve Board has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include but are not limited to: factoring accounts receivable; making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities; leasing personal or real property; operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; trust company functions; financial and investment advisory activities; conducting securities brokerage activities; underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; performing selected data processing services and support services; acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and performing selected insurance underwriting activities. 
 Support of Subsidiary Institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to act as a source of financial strength for our bank subsidiary and to commit resources to support the bank. Under current federal law, the Federal Reserve may require us to make capital injections into our bank subsidiary and may charge us with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if we fail to commit resources to our bank subsidiary or if we undertake actions that the Federal Reserve believes might jeopardize our ability to commit resources to the bank. As a result, an obligation to support our bank subsidiary may be required at times when, without this requirement, we might not be inclined to provide it. 
 Safe and Sound Banking Practices. Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve Boards Regulation Y, for example, generally requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the companys consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. Depending upon the circumstances, the Federal Reserve Board could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 
 
17 


 The Federal Reserve Board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as approximately $2 million for each day the activity continues. 
 Annual Reporting; Examinations. We are required to file annual reports with the Federal Reserve Board, and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act. The Federal Reserve Board may examine a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries and charge the company for the cost of such examination. 
 Capital Adequacy Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted a system using risk-based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies having $500 million or more in assets on a consolidated basis. Under the guidelines, specific categories of assets are assigned different risk weights, based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset. These risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk-weighted asset base. The guidelines in effect as of December 31, 2018 require a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% (of which at least 6.0% is required to consist of Tier 1 capital elements) and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% (of which at least 8.0% is required to consist of Tier 1 capital elements) to be well-capitalized. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. As of December 31, 2018, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.93% and our total risk-based capital ratio was 15.31%. Thus, as of December 31, 2018, we are considered well-capitalized for regulatory purposes. 
 In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the Federal Reserve Board uses a leverage ratio as an additional tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies. The leverage ratio is a companys Tier 1 capital divided by its average total consolidated assets. Certain highly-rated bank holding companies may maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0%, but other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0%. Well-capitalized is a leverage ratio in excess of 5%. As of December 31, 2018, our leverage ratio was 10.36%. 
 The federal banking agencies risk-based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve Board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions, substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act includes certain provisions concerning the capital regulations of the federal banking agencies. These provisions, often referred to as the Collins Amendment, are intended to subject bank holding companies to the same capital requirements as their bank subsidiaries and to eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. Under the Collins Amendment, trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 by a company, such as our Company, with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, and treated as regulatory capital are grandfathered, but any such securities issued later are not eligible as regulatory capital. The Collins Amendment requires banking regulators to develop regulations setting minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements for holding companies and banks on a consolidated basis that are no less stringent than the generally applicable requirements in effect for depository institutions under the prompt corrective action regulations discussed below. The banking regulators also must seek to make capital standards countercyclical so that the required levels of capital increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction. 
 In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems (Basel III) and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule applies to all depository institutions, bank holding companies with total 
 
18 


  consolidated assets of $500 million or more and savings and loan holding companies (collectively, banking organizations). Among other things, the rule established a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets) and a higher minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital requirement (6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns higher risk weightings (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on non-accrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. As of December 31, 2018, the Companys common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.34%. 
 The final rule permanently grandfathers trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying capital instruments that were issued and outstanding as of May 19, 2010 in the Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009. The rule phases out of Tier 1 capital these non-qualifying capital instruments issued before May 19, 2010 by all other bank holding companies. Because our total consolidated assets were less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, our outstanding trust preferred securities continue to be treated as Tier 1 capital. However, now that we have exceeded $15 billion in assets, if we acquire another financial institution in the future, then the Tier 1 treatment of our outstanding trust preferred securities will be phased out, but those securities will still be treated as Tier 2 capital. 
 The final rule also limits a banking organizations capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule became effective for the Company and our bank subsidiary on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in on January 1, 2016, and the full capital conservation buffer requirement became effective January 1, 2019. As of January 1, 2016, the required capital conservation buffer was 0.625% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital conservation buffer increased to 1.25% as of January 1, 2017, 1.875% effective January 1, 2018 and 2.5% effective January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, our capital conservation buffer was 5.93%. 
 Liquidity Requirements. Historically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without minimum required formulaic measures. The Basel III liquidity framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio, is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entitys expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements are expected to incent banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. The federal banking agencies have not determined to what extent they will apply to U.S. banks that are not large, internationally active banks. 
 Stress Testing. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, in October 2012, the Federal Reserve Board published its final rules regarding company-run stress testing. The rules require institutions with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion, such as the Company and our bank subsidiary, to conduct an annual company-run stress test of capital and consolidated earnings and losses under one base and at least two stress scenarios provided by bank regulatory agencies. 
 On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the EGRRCPA) was signed into law, making certain limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as certain targeted modifications to other post-financial crisis regulations. Among other things, the law raises the asset thresholds for Dodd-Frank Act company-run stress testing, liquidity coverage and living will requirements for bank holding companies to $250 billion, subject to the ability of the Fed to apply such requirements to institutions with assets of $100 billion or more to address financial stability risks or safety and soundness concerns. On July 6, 2018, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC) issued a joint interagency statement regarding the impact of the EGRRCPA. As a result of this statement and the EGRRCPA, we and our bank subsidiary are no longer subject to Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements and were not required to undergo stress testing in 2018. Notwithstanding these amendments to the stress testing requirements, the federal banking agencies indicated 
 
19 


  through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than $100 billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process. We will continue to monitor our capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators. 
 Risk Management. Regulation YY requires publicly-traded bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets to establish a risk committee responsible for oversight of enterprise-wide risk management practices. The committee must be chaired by an independent director and include at least one risk management expert with experience in managing risk exposures of large, complex firms. As a result of our total assets exceeding $10 billion, we established a risk committee meeting these requirements. However, effective May 2018, the recently enacted EGRRCPA increased the asset threshold for mandatory risk committees from $10 billion to $50 billion in total assets. While we are no longer required to maintain a risk committee, we currently continue to utilize our risk committee to oversee our enterprise-wide risk management practices. 
 Regulation YY also requires us, as a publicly-traded bank holding company with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets, to have a global risk management framework commensurate with their structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, and size. The risk management framework must include risk management policies and procedures, as well as processes and controls to implement them. Accordingly, we have adopted a compliant risk management framework. 
 Payment of Dividends. We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our bank subsidiary and other affiliated entities. The principal sources of our cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders, are dividends that our bank subsidiary pays to us as its sole shareholder. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the dividends that our bank subsidiary can pay to us, as well as to the dividends we can pay to our shareholders. 
 The policy of the Federal Reserve Board that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank also results in the position of the Federal Reserve Board that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiary or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding companys ability to serve as such a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Arkansas law. 
 There are certain state-law limitations on the payment of dividends by our bank subsidiary. Centennial Bank, which is subject to Arkansas banking laws, may not declare or pay a dividend of 75% or more of the net profits of such bank after all taxes for the current year plus 75% of the retained net profits for the immediately preceding year without the prior approval of the Arkansas State Bank Commissioner. Members of the Federal Reserve System must also comply with the dividend restrictions with which a national bank would be required to comply. Among other things, these restrictions require that if losses have at any time been sustained by a bank equal to or exceeding its undivided profits then on hand, no dividend may be paid. Although we have historically paid quarterly dividends on our common stock, there can be no assurances that we will be able to pay dividends in the future under the applicable regulatory limitations. 
 The payment of dividends by us, or by our bank subsidiary, may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institutions capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under FDICIA, a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would result in the depository institution being undercapitalized. 
 Subsidiary Bank 
 General. Our bank subsidiary, Centennial Bank, is chartered as an Arkansas state bank and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, making it primarily subject to regulation and supervision by both the Federal Reserve Board and the Arkansas State Bank Department. In addition, our bank subsidiary is subject to various requirements and 
 
20 


  restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that they may charge, and limitations on the types of investments they may make and on the types of services they may offer. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of our bank subsidiary. Further, because our bank subsidiary had total assets of over $10 billion as of December 31, 2018, it is subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB, which is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. 
 Prompt Corrective Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized financial institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) in which all institutions are placed. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category. 
 An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. 
 The Basel III final rule issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies in July 2013 amended the prompt corrective action rules to incorporate a common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and to raise the capital requirements for certain capital categories. These rules became effective as of January 1, 2015. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules, a banking organization will be required to have at least an 8% total risk-based capital ratio, a 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 4% Tier 1 leverage ratio. To be well-capitalized, a banking organization will be required to have at least a 10% total risk-based capital ratio, an 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 5% Tier 1 leverage ratio. 
 Deposit Insurance and Assessments. Centennial Banks deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the deposit coverage limit to $250,000 per depositor retroactive to January 1, 2008. 
 The FDIC imposes an assessment against institutions for deposit insurance. This assessment is based primarily on the risk category of the institution and certain risk adjustments specified by the FDIC, with riskier institutions paying higher assessments. Under the FDICs risk-based assessment system, insured institutions with at least $10 billion in assets are assessed on the basis of a scoring system that combines the institutions regulatory ratings and certain financial measures. The scoring system assesses risk measures to produce two scores, a performance score and a loss severity score, that will be combined and converted to an initial assessment rate. The performance score measures an institutions financial performance and its ability to withstand stress. The loss severity score quantifies the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of an institutions failure. Once the performance and loss severity scores are calculated, these scores will be converted to a total score. The FDIC has the authority to raise or lower assessment rates, subject to limits, and to impose special additional assessments. 
 The FDICs restoration program for the DIF adopted in 2010 is designed to bolster the DIF reserve ratio to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The plan provides that, at least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking if required. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are required to fund the increase in the designated reserve ratio (DRR) to 1.35%. 
 
21 


 In 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule implementing changes to the deposit insurance assessment system, as authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, changed the assessment base for insured depository institutions from adjusted domestic deposits to the institutions average consolidated total assets during an assessment period less average tangible equity capital (Tier 1 capital) during that period. The rule revised the assessment rate schedule so that it ranges from 2.5 basis points for the least risky institutions to 45 basis points for the riskiest institutions. The rule also suspended indefinitely the requirement of the FDIC to pay dividends from the DIF when it reaches 1.5% of insured deposits. In lieu of the dividends, the FDIC adopted progressively lower assessment rate schedules when the reserve ratio exceeds 1.15%, 2.0% and 2.5%, respectively. In addition, a final rule issued by the FDIC in March 2016 required insured institutions with an assessment base (total assets less tangible capital) of over $10 billion to pay surcharge insurance assessments at an annual rate of 4.5 basis points of their assessment base, starting the quarter after the DRR surpassed 1.15% and ending when the DRR reached 1.35%. The 4.5 basis point surcharge will be assessed against each covered institutions assessment base, less $10 billion. 
 The DRR exceeded 1.15% as of June 30, 2016. As a result, the base deposit insurance rates now range from (i) 1.5 to 30 basis points of an institutions assessment base for small banks and (ii) 1.5 to 40 basis points for institutions with an assessment base of over $10 billion, which are also now subject to the 4.5 basis point surcharge. The surcharge continued through October 1, 2018, when the reserve ratio exceeded 1.35%. 
 In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC must pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established as a financing vehicle for the Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation. The assessment rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 is 0.46% of assets and is adjusted quarterly. These assessments will continue until the bonds mature in 2019. 
 Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 
 Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act requires, in connection with examinations of financial institutions, that federal banking regulators evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. These facts are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on our bank subsidiary. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of various Community Reinvestment Act-related agreements. Our bank subsidiary received a satisfactory CRA rating from the Federal Reserve Bank during its last exam as published in our banks CRA Public Evaluation. 
 Capital Requirements. Our bank subsidiary is also subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as a result of the requirement that it maintain adequate levels of capital in accordance with guidelines promulgated from time to time by applicable regulators. The regulating agencies consider a banks capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system. The Federal Reserve Bank monitors the capital adequacy of our bank subsidiary by using a combination of risk-based guidelines and leverage ratios. 
 The FDIC Improvement Act. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, made a number of reforms addressing the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system, supervision of domestic and foreign depository institutions, and improvement of accounting standards. This statute also limited deposit insurance coverage, implemented changes in consumer protection laws and provided for least-cost resolution and prompt regulatory action with regard to troubled institutions. 
 FDICIA requires every bank with total assets in excess of $500 million to have an annual independent audit made of the banks financial statements by an independent public accountant to verify that the financial statements of the bank are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and comply with such other disclosure requirements as prescribed by the FDIC. FDICIA also places certain restrictions on activities of banks depending on their level of capital.

 The capital classification of a bank affects the frequency of examinations of the bank and impacts the ability of the bank to engage in certain activities and affects the deposit insurance premiums paid by such bank. Under FDICIA, the federal banking regulators are required to conduct a full-scope, on-site examination of every bank at least once every 12 months. 
 Brokered Deposits. Under FDICIA, banks may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits, depending on their capital classification. Well-capitalized banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits, but banks that are not well-capitalized are not permitted to accept such deposits. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis, permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept brokered deposits if the FDIC determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank. The EGRRCPA enacted in May 2018 provides that most reciprocal deposits are no longer treated as brokered deposits. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System. The Federal Home Loan Bank system, of which our bank subsidiary is a member, consists of regional FHLBs governed and regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA. The FHLBs serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions. They are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. They make loans (i.e., advances) to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the FHLB and the boards of directors of each regional FHLB. 
 As a system member, our bank subsidiary is entitled to borrow from the FHLB of its region and is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. Our bank subsidiary is in compliance with the stock ownership rules with respect to such advances, commitments and letters of credit and home mortgage loans and similar obligations. All loans, advances and other extensions of credit made by the FHLB to our bank subsidiary are secured by a portion of its respective loan portfolio, certain other investments and the capital stock of the FHLB held by such bank. 
 Federal Reserve System. Federal Reserve regulations require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and demand deposit accounts). A reserve of 3% is to be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts between $16.0 million and $122.3 million (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve) plus a reserve of 10% (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve between 8% and 14%) against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of $122.3 million. The first $16.0 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve) is exempt from the reserve requirements. Our bank subsidiary is in compliance with the foregoing requirements. 
 Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations. The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending, which was re-emphasized in December 2015. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (1) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (2) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential properties and loans for construction, land development and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the banks commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner occupied loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. 
 Mortgage Banking Operations. Our bank subsidiary is subject to the rules and regulations of FHA, VA, FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA with respect to originating, processing, selling and servicing mortgage loans and the issuance and sale of mortgage-backed securities. Those rules and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines which include provisions for inspections and appraisals, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and fix maximum loan amounts, and, with respect to VA loans, fix maximum interest rates. 
 
23 


 Consumer Financial Protection. Our bank subsidiary is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the banks ability to raise interest rates and subject the bank to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which our bank subsidiary operates and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our bank subsidiarys failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions the bank may wish to pursue or its prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has supervisory authority over depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion or greater. The CFPB focuses its supervision and regulatory efforts on (1) risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws when it evaluates the policies and practices of a financial institution; (2) the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets; (3) depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services; (4) certain depository institutions with a more specialized focus; and (5) non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services. 
 The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumers ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumers (1) lack of financial savvy, (2) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services or (3) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumers interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, as well as their affiliates. 
 Loans to One Borrower. Our bank subsidiary generally may not make loans or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, up to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2018, our bank subsidiary was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations. 
 Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Under Regulation Y, our bank subsidiary is prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. 
 Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates. We and our bank subsidiary are subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. In general, Section 23A imposes limits on the amount of transactions between the bank and its affiliates, and also requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties. It also limits the amount of advances to affiliates which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the bank or its nonbanking affiliates. An affiliate of a bank is generally any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank. 
 Affiliate transactions are also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which generally requires that certain other transactions between the bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at that time for comparable transactions with or involving other non-affiliated persons. 
 
24 


 Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation O, also place restrictions on loans by a bank to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10% shareholder of a bank and certain of their related interests, or insiders, and insiders of affiliates, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and related interests, the banks loans-to-one-borrower limit. Section 22(h) also requires that loans to insiders and to insiders of affiliates be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of the bank and (ii) does not give preference to insiders over other employees of the bank. In addition, Section 22(h) requires prior board of directors approval for certain loans, and the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the institutions unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. 
 Interchange Fees. Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. Interchange fees, or swipe fees, are charges that merchants pay to our bank subsidiary and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Federal Reserve Board rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee is equal to no more than 21 cents plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. A debit card issuer may also recover 1 cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. We exceeded $10 billion in assets during the first quarter of 2017 and became subject to the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act interchange fee restrictions beginning in the third quarter of 2018. The Durbin Amendment negatively impacted debit card and ATM fees beginning in the second half of 2018. During the third and fourth quarters of 2018, we collected $6.6 million in debit card interchange fees, which was approximately $5.3 million lower from debit interchange fees of $11.9 million collected during the third and fourth quarter of 2017. 
 The Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The statutory provision is commonly called the Volcker Rule. In December 2013, federal regulators adopted final rules to implement the Volcker Rule that generally became effective in July 2015. The Volcker Rule also requires covered banking entities, including us and our bank subsidiary, to implement certain compliance programs, and the complexity and rigor of such programs is determined based on the asset size and complexity of the business of the covered company. Since neither we nor our bank subsidiary engages in the types of trading or investing covered by the Volcker Rule, the Volcker Rule does not currently have any effect on our or our bank subsidiarys operations. 
 Privacy. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except under narrow circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly sponsoring a product or service with a nonaffiliated third party. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. We and our subsidiary have established policies and procedures to assure our compliance with all privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. 
 We are also subject to various regulatory guidance as updated from time to time and implemented by the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council (the FFIEC), an interagency body of the FDIC, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the National Credit Union Administration and various state regulatory authorities. The FFIEC has provided guidance in areas such as data privacy, disaster recovery, information security, and third-party vendor management to identify potential risks related to our services that could adversely affect our customers. In addition, lawmakers, regulators and the public are increasingly focused on the use of personal information and efforts to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The law in these areas continues to develop, and we expect regulation in these areas to continue to increase.

 Anti-Terrorism and Anti-Money Laundering Legislation. Our bank subsidiary is subject to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the USA PATRIOT Act), the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and rules and regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (the OFAC). These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specific financial transactions and account relationships intended to guard against money laundering, terrorism financing and transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others on whom the United States has imposed economic sanctions. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. 
 As part of our bank subsidiarys anti-money laundering (AML) program, we are required to designate a BSA officer, maintain a BSA/AML training program, maintain internal controls to effectuate the BSA/AML program, implement independent testing of the BSA/AML program, and as of February 1, 2019, comply with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Networks new Customer Due Diligence for Financial Institutions Rule (the CDD Rule). The CDD Rule adds a new requirement for our bank subsidiary to identify and verify the identity of natural persons (beneficial owners) of legal entity customers who own, control and profit from companies when those companies open accounts. The CDD Rule requires covered financial institutions to establish and maintain written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to (1) identify and verify the identity of customers; (2) identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of companies opening accounts; (3) understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships to develop customer risk profiles; and (4) conduct ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions and, on a risk basis, to maintain and update customer information. With respect to the new requirement to obtain beneficial ownership information, financial institutions will have to identify and verify the identity of any individuals who own 25 percent or more of a legal entity, and an individual who controls the legal entity. 
 Incentive Compensation. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. 
 In June 2010, the Federal Reserve and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors. 
 In May 2016, the Federal Reserve, other federal banking agencies and the SEC jointly published a revised version of proposed rulemaking initially issued in April 2011 designed to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking at a covered institution, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more of assets, such as the Company and our bank subsidiary. The proposed joint compensation regulations would require compensation practices consistent with the three principles discussed above. As of February 1, 2019, these regulations have not been finalized. Unless and until a final rule is adopted, we cannot fully determine whether compliance with such a rule will adversely affect the Companys or our bank subsidiarys ability to hire, retain and motivate our key employees. 
 The Federal Reserve Board reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not large, complex banking organizations. These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organizations activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of this supervisory initiative will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations 
 
26 


  supervisory ratings, which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 
 Proposed Legislation and Regulatory Action 
 From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment for us and our bank subsidiary in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. 
Effect of Governmental Monetary Polices 
 Our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve Boards monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board affect the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which banks are subject. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies. 
AVAILABLE INFORMATION
