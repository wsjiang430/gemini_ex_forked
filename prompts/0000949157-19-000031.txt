Item 1.  Business
Overview
Century Aluminum Company is a global producer of primary aluminum and operates aluminum reduction facilities, or "smelters," in the United States and Iceland.  Aluminum is an internationally traded commodity, and its price is effectively determined on the London Metal Exchange (the "LME"), plus applicable regional and product premiums. Our primary aluminum facilities produce standard-grade and value-added primary aluminum products.  Our current annual production capacity is approximately 1,016,000 tonnes per year ("tpy"). We produced approximately 753,000 tonnes of primary aluminum in 2018.
In addition to our primary aluminum assets, we own a carbon anode production facility located in the Netherlands ("Vlissingen") and hold a 40% interest in Baise Haohai Carbon Co., Ltd. ("BHH"), a joint venture that owns and operates a carbon anode and cathode facility located in China. Carbon anodes are consumed in the production of primary aluminum. Both BHH and Vlissingen currently supply carbon anodes to our smelter in Grundartangi, Iceland. Each of our smelters in the United States sources anodes from on-site carbon anode production facilities.
We operate our business through one reportable segment, primary aluminum. Additional information about our segment reporting and certain geographic information is available in Note 18. Business Segments to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
Century Aluminum Company is a Delaware corporation with our principal executive offices located at One South Wacker Drive, Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60606.
Strategic Objective
Our strategic objective is to maximize the financial returns we generate for our stockholders by: (a) optimizing our safety and environmental performance; (b) improving the competitiveness of our existing assets by managing costs and improving productivity and efficiency; (c) pursuing upstream investment opportunities in bauxite mining, alumina refining and the production of other key operating supplies; and (d) expanding our primary aluminum business by improving and investing in the facilities we currently own as well as constructing, investing in or acquiring additional capacity. 
Primary Aluminum Facilities
Overview of Facilities
We operate three U.S. aluminum smelters, in Hawesville, Kentucky ("Hawesville"), Robards, Kentucky ("Sebree") and Goose Creek, South Carolina ("Mt. Holly"), and one aluminum smelter in Grundartangi, Iceland ("Grundartangi"). 
Grundartangi
The Grundartangi facility, located in Grundartangi, Iceland, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nordural Grundartangi ehf, and is our most modern facility. Grundartangi is currently in the process of a multi-year expansion project that has brought the annual production capacity from 280,000 tonnes to current capacity of 317,000 tonnes (2018 volume) and is expected to ultimately increase annual production capacity to approximately 325,000 tonnes.  Grundartangi produces standard-grade aluminum ingot and a primary foundry alloy product, which is a value-added product that is sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum. 
Hawesville
Hawesville, located adjacent to the Ohio River near Hawesville, Kentucky, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Kentucky, Inc. ("CAKY"). Hawesville has an annual production capacity of approximately 250,000 tonnes. Approximately 60% of Hawesville's capacity was curtailed in the fourth quarter of 
1

2015 as a result of significant declines in the LME price for aluminum. In 2018, we began the process of restarting capacity on the three potlines at Hawesville that had been curtailed. The first of these three lines was restarted in September 2018 and the second was restarted in December 2018. We expect that the third line will be restarted and back in operation during the first quarter of 2019. Each line represents incremental production of approximately 50,000 tonnes per year when fully operational.
Hawesville produces standard-grade and high-purity aluminum that can be cast into sow or delivered directly to nearby customers as molten metal. 
Hawesville is our largest U.S. smelter and has the capacity to be the largest producer of high purity primary aluminum in North America. Four of Hawesville's five potlines are capable of producing high purity aluminum which is sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum and is used extensively by the defense industry as well as for aerospace and other applications.  
Sebree
Sebree, located adjacent to the Green River near Robards, Kentucky, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum Sebree LLC ("Century Sebree"). Sebree has an annual production capacity of approximately 220,000 tonnes. Sebree produces standard-grade aluminum that can be cast into sow and value-added products, including billet, that are sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum or delivered directly to nearby customers as molten metal. In May 2018, we temporarily curtailed one potline at Sebree due to an equipment failure. We returned the curtailed potline at Sebree back to service during the third quarter of 2018. 
Mt. Holly
Mt. Holly, located in Goose Creek, South Carolina, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum of South Carolina, Inc. ("CASC"). Mt. Holly has an annual production capacity of approximately 229,000 tonnes. The Mt. Holly facility is currently operating at approximately 50% of capacity while CASC pursues a long-term power solution. See "Key Production Costs — Electrical Power Supply Agreements" below for further discussion of our power arrangements at Mt. Holly.
Mt. Holly produces standard-grade aluminum that is cast into tee bars as well as several value-added products, including billet and foundry products. These value-added primary aluminum products are sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum. 
Primary Aluminum Production Capacity
Our primary aluminum smelters and their respective capacities are shown in the following table: 

Facility | Ownership Percentage | Operational | Annual Production Capacity (tpy) (1) | Actual 2018 Annual Production (tpy) 
Grundartangi, Iceland | 100% | 1998 | 317,000 | 317,000 
Hawesville, Kentucky USA | 100% | 1970 | 250,000 | 117,000 
Sebree, Kentucky, USA | 100% | 1973 | 220,000 | 204,000 
Mt. Holly, South Carolina USA | 100% | 1980 | 229,000 | 115,000 
 | | | 1,016,000 | 753,000 


(1) | The tonnes per year (tpy) figures in this column reflect an estimate of the facility's total production capacity based on plant design, historical operating results and operating efficiencies and does not necessarily represent each facility’s maximum production capability.

Primary Aluminum Shipment Volume
The following table shows our primary aluminum shipment volumes since 2014(1).

(1) | Shipment volumes reflect (i) our acquisition of the remaining interest in Mt. Holly in December 2014; (ii) the partial curtailment of our Hawesville and Mt. Holly operations during the fourth quarter of 2015; and (iii) increases from the Hawesville restart in 2018, offset by lower production due to the temporary potline outage at Sebree.

Primary Aluminum Projects
Helguvik project 
The Helguvik project is a greenfield project for an aluminum reduction facility in Helguvik, Iceland ("Helguvik" or the "Helguvik project"), owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary Nordural Helguvik ehf ("Nordural Helguvik"). The Helguvik project site is located approximately 30 miles from the city of Reykjavik, Iceland.  Construction activity and spending on the project have remained curtailed since 2008 pending our ability to secure power delivery for the project at competitive prices. See "Key Production Costs — Electrical Power Supply Agreements" below for further discussion of our power arrangements at Helguvik. 
Carbon Products Facilities
In addition to our primary aluminum assets, we also own a carbon anode production facility located in Vlissingen, the Netherlands, and a 40% interest in BHH, a joint venture that owns and operates a carbon anode and cathode facility located in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of south China. 
Vlissingen
3

Vlissingen is a carbon anode production facility owned and operated by Century Aluminum Vlissingen B.V. Vlissingen has an annual carbon anode production capacity of 145,000 tonnes. We acquired Vlissingen in 2012 and restarted the facility in late 2013 with an initial carbon anode production capacity of 75,000 tonnes. In 2015, we completed our project to expand its annual production capacity to 145,000 tonnes and we have begun a project to rebuild one of the baking furnaces at Vlissingen which is expected to increase annual carbon anode production capacity by an additional 12,000 tonnes per year. The rebuilt baking furnace is expected to be operational before the end of 2019. Vlissingen currently supplies carbon anodes to our smelter in Grundartangi, Iceland. Each of our smelters in the United States sources anodes from on-site carbon anode production facilities.
Baise Haohai Carbon Company, Ltd.
BHH is a carbon anode and cathode facility which commenced operations in 2008. BHH is operated as a joint venture between one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, which owns a 40% stake in the company, and Guangxi Qiangqiang Carbon Co., Ltd., which holds the remaining 60% ownership interest and is the operator of this facility. The BHH facility has an annual carbon anode production capacity of 180,000 tonnes and an annual cathode baking and graphitization capacity of 20,000 tonnes. Following the completion of the construction of our second furnace at our carbon anode facility in Vlissingen, Netherlands, we made the decision to pursue an exit from this investment. There is no assurance that we will be successful in exiting this investment on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.
Pricing
Pricing for primary aluminum products is typically comprised of three components: (i) the base commodity price which is based on quoted prices on the LME and other exchanges, (ii) any regional premium (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold in the United States and the European Duty Paid premium for metal sold into Europe) and (iii) any product premium. Our operating results are highly sensitive to changes in the LME price of primary aluminum and the amount of regional delivery and product premiums.  As a result, from time to time, we assess the appropriateness of mitigating the effects of fluctuations in the aluminum price through the use of fixed-price commitments, LME-linked supply contracts and financial instruments. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for further discussion of how we manage our exposure to market risk. 
Customer Base
We have historically derived substantially all of our consolidated net sales from a small number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived approximately 64% of our consolidated sales from Glencore plc and its affiliates (together, "Glencore") and approximately 11% of our consolidated sales from Southwire Company ("Southwire"). We currently have agreements in place to sell a substantial portion of our 2019 production to these customers. We expect that the rest of our 2019 customer base will remain fairly concentrated among a small number of customers under short-term contracts.
Both Glencore and Southwire purchase aluminum produced at our North American smelters at prices based on the LME price for primary aluminum plus the Midwest regional premium and any additional market based product premiums. Glencore also purchases aluminum produced at our Grundartangi, Iceland smelter at prices based on the LME plus the European Duty Paid premium and any applicable product premiums. Glencore beneficially owns 42.9% of our outstanding common stock (47.2% on a fully diluted basis) and purchases the aluminum we produce for resale. 
Key Production Costs
Alumina, electrical power, calcined petroleum coke and liquid pitch (the key raw materials for carbon anodes), and labor are the principal components of our cost of production.  These components together represented over 75% of our cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018.  For a description of certain risks related to our raw materials, supplies and labor, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) | Both parties are continuing to operate under the terms of this agreement while we negotiate a new agreement. Under the terms of this agreement, Glencore provides alumina supply for all of Century's requirements net of other contractual commitments. 


(2) | "API" refers to a published alumina price index ("API").

Electrical Power Supply Agreements
The table below summarizes our long-term power supply agreements:

Facility | | Supplier | Term | Pricing 
Grundartangi | | Landsvirkjun | Through 2023 - 2036 | Variable rate linked to (i) the LME price for primary aluminum or (ii) the Nord Pool power market
 | Orkuveita Reykjavíkur ("OR") | 
 | HS Orka hf ("HS") | 
Hawesville | | Kenergy Corporation ("Kenergy") | Through December 31, 2023 | Variable rate based on market prices 
Sebree | | Kenergy | Through December 31, 2023 | Variable rate based on market prices 
Mt. Holly | | South Carolina Public Service Authority | Through December 31, 2020 | Variable rate based in part on a cost of service charge and in part on natural gas prices 
Helguvik | | OR | Approximately 25 years from the dates of each phase of power delivery | Variable rate based on the LME price for primary aluminum 

Electrical power represents one of the largest components of our cost of goods sold. From time to time, we may enter into forward contracts or other hedging arrangements to mitigate our electrical power or natural gas price risk. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the long-term power arrangements for each of our operations.
Grundartangi. Power is currently supplied to Grundartangi from hydroelectric and geothermal sources under long-term power purchase agreements with HS, Landsvirkjun and OR at prices indexed to the price of primary aluminum, which provides a natural hedge for one of our largest production costs.  Beginning in November of 2019, our contract with Landsvirkjun (covering approximately 30% of our current power requirements at Grundartangi) will be priced linked to the market price for power in the Nord Pool power market, the trading market for power in the Nordic countries and certain other areas of Europe. 
5

We have entered into financial contracts to fix the forward price of approximately 4% of Grundartangi's total power requirements for the period from November 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020. 
Grundartangi's power purchase agreements expire on various dates from 2023 through 2036 (subject to extension). Each power purchase agreement contains take-or-pay obligations with respect to a significant percentage of the total committed and available power under such agreement. 
Hawesville. CAKY is party to a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and EDF Trading North America, LLC (“EDF") which provides market-based power to the Hawesville smelter. Under this arrangement, the power companies purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Hawesville at Midcontinent Independent System Operator ("MISO") pricing plus transmission and other costs. The power supply arrangement with Kenergy has an effective term through December 2023. The arrangement with EDF to act as our market participant with MISO has an effective term through May 2020. Both of these agreements extend automatically year to year thereafter unless a one year notice of termination is given by either party.
Sebree. Century Sebree is party to a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and EDF which provides market-based power to the Sebree smelter. Similar to the arrangement at Hawesville, the power companies purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Sebree at MISO pricing plus transmission and other costs. The power supply arrangement with Kenergy has an effective term through December 2023. The arrangement with EDF to act as our market participant with MISO has an effective term through May 2020. Both of these agreements extend automatically year to year thereafter unless a one year notice of termination is given by either party.
Mt. Holly. CASC is party to a power agreement with the South Carolina Public Service Authority ("Santee Cooper") for power to the Mt. Holly smelter. Under this contract, 25% of Mt. Holly's electric power requirements is supplied from Santee Cooper's generation at cost-of-service based rates. The remaining 75% of Mt. Holly's electric power requirements is supplied from third-party generation at rates based on natural gas prices. The agreement with Santee Cooper has a term through December 31, 2020 and can be terminated by Mt. Holly on 120 days' notice. The agreement with the other power supplier has a term through December 31, 2020 and may be terminated by Mt. Holly on 60 days' notice.
Mt. Holly's inability to access the open market for 100% of its power requirements significantly impacts its ability to be competitive in the aluminum industry and puts its continued operation at risk. As a result of such uncompetitive power prices, Mt. Holly has already curtailed 50% of its production capacity. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. If we are unable to enter into a long term, market-based power arrangement for Mt. Holly, we may choose, or be forced, to curtail operations at the plant.
Helguvik. Nordural Helguvik is party to a power agreement with OR for a portion of Helguvik’s expected power requirements to the Helguvik project.  The first stage of power under the OR power purchase agreement (approximately 47.5 megawatts ("MW")) became available in the fourth quarter of 2011 and is currently being utilized at Grundartangi. The agreement contains certain conditions to OR’s obligations with respect to the remaining phases and OR has alleged that certain of these conditions have not been satisfied. We are in discussions with OR with respect to such conditions and other matters pertaining to this agreement.
See Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information concerning our power arrangements. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,069 employees. 
Labor Agreements 
The bargaining unit employees at our Grundartangi, Vlissingen, Hawesville and Sebree facilities are represented by labor unions, representing 65% of our total workforce.  Our employees at Mt. Holly are not represented by a labor union.

A summary of our key labor agreements is provided below:
 
Facility | Organization | Term 
Grundartangi | Icelandic labor unions | Through December 31, 2019
Hawesville | USW | Through April 1, 2020 
Sebree | USW | Through October 28, 2023 
Vlissingen | FME | Through December 1, 2020 

Approximately 84% of Grundartangi’s workforce is represented by five labor unions, governed by a labor agreement that establishes wages and work rules for covered employees. The current agreement is effective through December 31, 2019. 
100% of Vlissingen's workforce is represented by the Federation for the Metal and Electrical Industry (the "FME"). The FME negotiates working conditions with trade unions on behalf of its members. The current labor agreement is effective through December 1, 2020.
Approximately 57% of our U.S. based workforce is represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union ("USW"). CAKY's Hawesville employees represented by the USW are under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on April 1, 2020. Century Sebree's employees represented by USW are under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on October 28, 2023. 
Competition
The market for primary aluminum is global, and demand for aluminum varies widely from region to region.  We compete with aluminum producers within the U.S. and internationally as well as with producers of alternative materials such as steel, copper, carbon fiber, composites, plastic and glass, each of which may be substituted for aluminum in certain applications. Our competitive position depends, in part, on the availability of electricity, alumina and our other key raw materials to our operations at competitive prices. We face global competition from companies who may have access to these key production costs at lower prices. Many of our competitors are also larger than we are and have vertically integrated operations with superior cost positions. As a result, these companies may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions.
While we face significant competition, we also have several competitive advantages. We believe our key competitive advantages are:
Focus on upstream aluminum business. We operate principally in the production of primary aluminum. By concentrating our activities in the upstream part of the aluminum industry, we are able to focus our resources on optimizing the cost effectiveness of our existing operations, minimizing overhead costs and maintaining a market position where our products are ultimately targeted toward a broad range of end uses.
Significant Internal Growth Opportunities. In 2018, we began the process of restarting capacity on three potlines at Hawesville that had been curtailed since the fourth quarter of 2015. The first of these three lines was restarted in September 2018 and the second was restarted in December 2018. We expect that the third line will be restarted and back in operation during the first quarter of 2019. Operating Hawesville at full capacity would allow us to increase our annual production of aluminum by approximately 150,000 tonnes from recent levels. We are also in the process of a multi-year expansion project at our Grundartangi smelter that has brought Grundartangi’s annual production capacity from 280,000 tonnes to current capacity of 317,000 tonnes (2018 volume) and is expected to ultimately increase annual production capacity to approximately 325,000 tonnes.
Duty Free Access to our Major Customer Markets. Our facilities benefit from international and national trade laws and regulations. For example, the European Union imposes import tariffs on primary aluminum from producers outside the European Economic Area (the "EEA"), which includes Iceland and the U.S. imposes a 10% tariff on certain primary aluminum imports into the United States. Our U.S. and Icelandic businesses currently access these respective markets duty-free which provides us with an advantage over our competitors who sell into these markets under these tariff regimes.
7

Close Proximity to our Major Customers. Our U.S. facilities benefit from the proximity to our U.S. customer base, allowing us to capture the Midwest regional premium and providing a competitive advantage in freight costs over our competitors. The proximity to our customers also allows our Hawesville and Sebree plants to deliver a portion of their production in molten form, saving casting costs, and providing a competitive advantage over other potential suppliers. In Iceland, our proximity to European markets provides a competitive advantage for Grundartangi, including logistical benefits compared to our competitors outside the EEA. 
Access to Competitive Power. Our Kentucky operations benefit from market-based power contracts that provide electricity to these operations at competitive prices. Currently, all of our power under our power contract for our Grundartangi plant is indexed to the price of primary aluminum (and after November 2019, 70% of its power will continue to be indexed to the price of primary aluminum), which provides a natural hedge of one of our largest production costs. We continue to seek the ability to access the open market for 100% of our power requirements at Mt. Holly. 
  Diverse Value Added Product Portfolio. Our Hawesville plant has the capacity to be the largest producer of high purity aluminum in the United States. Four of Hawesville’s five potlines are capable of producing high purity aluminum, which is used extensively by the defense industry as well as for certain aerospace applications. We also have the ability across our operations to cast a variety of aluminum products, both in terms of shapes and alloys. These high purity and value-added primary aluminum products are sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum.
Sustainability. Our Grundartangi plant receives 100% of its power requirements from clean hydroelectric and geothermal sources, reducing our fossil fuel usage and mitigating the impact of any current or future carbon regulations.
For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.  We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant amounts for compliance with those laws and regulations.  In addition, some of our past manufacturing activities have resulted in environmental consequences that require remedial measures.  Under certain environmental laws, which may impose liability regardless of fault, we may be liable for the costs of remediation of contaminated property, including our current and formerly owned or operated properties or adjacent areas, or for the amelioration of damage to natural resources. We believe, based on currently available information, that our current environmental liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on Century.  However, we cannot predict the requirements of future environmental laws and future requirements at current or formerly owned or operated properties or adjacent areas or the outcome of certain existing litigation to which we are a party.  Such future requirements or events may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  More information concerning our environmental contingencies can be found in Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
Intellectual Property
We own or have rights to use a number of intellectual property rights relating to various aspects of our operations. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any of these intellectual property rights.
Disclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act 
Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (“ITRA”), effective August 10, 2012, added a new subsection (r) to Section 13 of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers that file periodic reports with the SEC to disclose in their annual and quarterly reports whether, during the reporting period, they or any of their “affiliates” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) have knowingly engaged in specified activities or transactions relating to Iran, including activities not prohibited by U.S. law and conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable laws. Issuers must also file a notice with the SEC if any disclosable activity under ITRA has been included in an annual or quarterly report. 
Because the SEC defines the term “affiliate” broadly, our largest stockholder may be considered an affiliate of the Company despite the fact that the Company has no control over its largest stockholder’s actions or the actions of its affiliates. As such, pursuant to Section 13(r)(1)(D)(iii) of the Exchange Act, the Company hereby discloses the following information provided by our largest stockholder regarding transactions or dealings with entities controlled by the Government of Iran (“the GOI”):
8

During the year ended December 31, 2018, non-U.S. affiliates of the largest stockholder of the Company (“the non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates”) entered into sales and purchase contracts for agricultural products, metals, minerals, and energy products with, or for delivery to or from Iranian entities wholly or majority owned by the GOI. The non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates performed their obligations under the contracts in compliance with applicable sanction laws and, where required, with the necessary prior approvals by the relevant governmental authorities.

The gross revenue of the non-U.S Stockholder Affiliates related to the contracts did not exceed the value of $1,049 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
The non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates do not allocate net profit on a country-by-country or activity-by-activity basis, but estimate that the net profit attributable to the contracts would not exceed a small fraction of the gross revenue from such contracts. It is not possible to determine accurately the precise net profit attributable to such contracts.
The contracts disclosed above do not violate applicable sanctions laws administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, and are not the subject of any enforcement action under Iran sanction laws.

In response to the re-imposition of certain US secondary sanctions, the non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates wound down such activities to the extent necessary to avoid any sanctionable activity after such sanctions took effect. 
The Company and its global subsidiaries had no transactions or activities requiring disclosure under ITRA, nor were we involved in the transactions described in this section. As of the date of this report, the Company is not aware of any other activity, transaction or dealing by it or any of its affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2018 that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.
