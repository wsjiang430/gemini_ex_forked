ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
We are a diversified healthcare company that seeks to establish industry-leading positions in large and rapidly growing medical markets. Our diagnostics business includes BioReference Laboratories (“BioReference”), the nation’s third-largest clinical laboratory with a core genetic testing business and an almost 300-person sales and marketing team to drive growth and leverage new products, including the 4Kscore prostate cancer diagnostic test and the Claros 1 in-office immunoassay platform. Our pharmaceutical business features Rayaldee, an FDA-approved treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism (“SHPT”) in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease (“CKD”) and vitamin D insufficiency (launched in November 2016), OPK88004, a selective androgen receptor modulator which we have studied for benign prostatic hyperplasia but for which we are exploring other indications, and OPK88003, a once or twice weekly oxyntomodulin for type 2 diabetes and obesity which is a clinically advanced drug candidate among the new class of GLP-1 glucagon receptor dual agonists (phase 2b). Our pharmaceutical business also features hGH-CTP, a once-weekly human growth hormone injection (in phase 3 and partnered with Pfizer). We operate established pharmaceutical business operations in Spain, Ireland, Chile, and Mexico, which are generating revenue and from which we expect to generate positive cash flow and facilitate future market entry for our products currently in development. We have a development and commercial supply pharmaceutical company as well as a global supply chain operation and holding company in Ireland, which we expect will play an important role in the development, manufacturing, distribution and approval of a wide variety of drugs with an emphasis on high potency products. We also own a specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”) manufacturer in Israel, which we expect will facilitate the development of our pipeline of molecules and compounds for our proprietary molecular diagnostic and therapeutic products. 
We have a highly experienced management team. Based on their experience in the industry, we believe that our management team has extensive development, regulatory and commercialization expertise and relationships that provide access to commercial opportunities.

GROWTH STRATEGY
We expect our future growth to come from leveraging our commercial infrastructure, proprietary technology and development strengths, and by opportunistically pursuing complementary, accretive, or strategic acquisitions and investments.
We launched our first pharmaceutical product, Rayaldee, in the U.S. market in the fourth quarter of 2016. We have under development a broad and diversified portfolio of diagnostic tests, small molecules, and biologics targeting a broad range of unmet medical needs. We also operate the third largest full service clinical laboratory in the U.S. We intend to continue to leverage our proprietary technology and our strengths in all phases of research and development to further develop and commercialize our portfolio of proprietary pharmaceutical and diagnostic products. In support of our strategy, we intend to:

• | continue to enhance our commercialization capability in the U.S. and internationally;


• | develop and commercialize Rayaldee for new indications, including the treatment of SHPT in patients with vitamin D insufficiency and stage 5 CKD requiring regular hemodialysis;


• | obtain requisite regulatory approval and compile clinical data for our most advanced product candidates; and


• | expand into other medical markets that provide significant opportunities and that we believe are complementary to and synergistic with our business.

In addition, we expect to leverage the BioReference business and infrastructure to drive rapid and widespread uptake of our diagnostic products, including the 4Kscore test. We also intend to leverage the genetic and genomic data generated and accumulated through BioReference’s genetic sequencing laboratory to enhance drug discovery and clinical trial programs. 
We have and expect to continue to be opportunistic and to pursue complementary or strategic acquisitions, licenses and investments. Our management team has significant experience in identifying, executing and integrating these transactions. We expect to use well-timed, carefully selected acquisitions, licenses and investments to continue to drive our growth, including:

• | Products and technologies. We intend to continue to pursue product and technology acquisitions and licenses that will complement our existing businesses and provide new product and market opportunities, enhance our profitability, leverage our existing assets, and contribute to our own organic growth. 


• | Commercial businesses. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of commercial businesses that will both drive our growth and provide geographically diverse sales and distribution opportunities. 


• | Early stage investments. We have and may continue to make investments in early stage companies that we perceive to have valuable proprietary technology and significant potential to create value for OPKO as a shareholder. 

CORPORATE INFORMATION
We were originally incorporated in Delaware in October 1991 under the name Cytoclonal Pharmaceutics, Inc., which was later changed to eXegenics, Inc. (“eXegenics”). On March 27, 2007, we were part of a three-way merger with Froptix Corporation (“Froptix”) and Acuity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Acuity”), both research and development companies. On June 8, 2007, we changed our name to OPKO Health, Inc. Our shares are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker “OPK” and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Our principal executive offices are located in leased office space in Miami, Florida. 
We currently manage our operations in two reportable segments: diagnostics and pharmaceuticals. The pharmaceutical segment consists of the pharmaceutical operations we operate in Chile, Mexico, Ireland, Israel and Spain and our pharmaceutical research and development operations. The diagnostics segment primarily consists of the clinical laboratory operations we acquired through the acquisition of BioReference in 2015 and our point-of-care operations.

Refer to Note 17 for financial information about the segments and geographic areas.
CURRENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND RELATED MARKETS
Diagnostics 
BioReference Laboratories
Through BioReference, the third largest full service clinical laboratory in the U. S., we offer comprehensive laboratory testing services utilized by healthcare providers in the detection, diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, and treatment of diseases, including esoteric testing, molecular diagnostics, anatomical pathology, genetics, women’s health and correctional healthcare. We market and sell these services to physician offices, clinics, hospitals, employers and governmental units nationally, with the largest concentration of business in the larger metropolitan areas across New York, New Jersey, Florida, Texas, Maryland, California, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Washington DC, Illinois and Massachusetts. 
BioReference has an almost 300-person sales and marketing team and operates a network of approximately 200 patient service centers. 
Our BioReference laboratory testing business consists of routine testing and esoteric testing. Routine tests measure various health parameters, such as the functions of the heart, kidney, liver, thyroid and other organs, including such tests as blood cell counts, cholesterol levels, pregnancy, substance abuse and urinalysis. We typically operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year and perform and report most routine test results within 24 hours. 
The esoteric tests we perform require sophisticated equipment and materials, highly skilled personnel and professional attention. Esoteric tests are ordered less frequently than routine tests and typically are priced higher than routine tests. Esoteric tests include tests related to endocrinology, genetics and genomics, immunology, microbiology, HIV tests, molecular diagnostics, next generation sequencing, oncology, serology, and toxicology. 
Through BioReference, we operate in the following highly specialized laboratory divisions: 

• | BioReference Laboratories. BioReference constitutes our core clinical testing laboratory offering automated, high volume routine testing services, STAT testing, informatics, HIV, Hep C and other molecular tests. 


• | GenPath (Oncology). National oncology presence with expertise in cancer pathology and diagnostics, as well as molecular diagnostics. Core tests include FLOW, IHC, MicroArray, FISH, ISH, Morphology, and full service oncology. 


• | GenPath (Women’s Health). Innovative technology platform for sexually transmitted infections has enabled expansion nationally with specimens coming from 41 states, including Image Directed Paps analysis, HPV Plus, and STI Testing. 


• | GeneDx. Industry leading national laboratory for testing rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases with international reach, performing testing on specimens from more than 50 countries. 


• | Laboratorio Buena Salud. National testing laboratory dedicated to serving the Spanish-speaking population in the U. S., where all business is conducted in Spanish including patient and physician interaction. 

We have one of the largest marketing staffs of any laboratory in the country with sales and marketing groups dedicated to urology, oncology, women’s health, genetic testing and correctional health, as well as cross-over groups selling to large institutions. All of our sales and marketing personnel operate in a dual capacity, as both marketing and client support representatives, which we believe provides better customer service and a strong connection with our customers. 
We expect the clinical laboratory testing industry will continue to experience growth in testing volumes due to aging of the population in the U.S., patient awareness of the value of laboratory tests, a decrease in the cost of tests, the development of sophisticated and specialized tests for detection and management of disease, increased recognition of early detection and prevention as a means of reducing healthcare costs, and ongoing research and development in genetics and genomics and personalized medicine. Our mission is to be recognized by our clients as the premier provider of clinical laboratory testing, information and related services. 
BioReference provides us with a significant diagnostics commercial infrastructure for marketing and sales that reached almost 11 million patients in 2018. In addition, its large team of managed care experts complement our efforts to ensure that payors recognize the value of our diagnostic and laboratory tests for reimbursement purposes. We continue to leverage the national marketing, sales and distribution resources of BioReference, along with its almost 300-person sales and marketing team, to enhance sales of and reimbursement for our 4Kscore test, a laboratory developed blood test that provides a personalized risk score for aggressive prostate cancer. We plan to leverage the BioReference commercial infrastructure and capabilities, as well as its extensive relationships with payors, to commercialize OPKO’s other diagnostic products under development. 
4Kscore Test
We offer the 4Kscore test through our BioReference laboratory located in Elmwood Park, New Jersey. We began selling the 4Kscore test in the U.S. in March 2014 and in Europe and Mexico in September 2014 and January 2015, respectively. The 4Kscore test is a laboratory developed test that measures the blood plasma levels of four different prostate-derived kallikrein proteins: Total PSA, Free PSA, Intact PSA and Human Kallikrein-2 (“hK2”). These biomarkers are then combined with a patient’s age, Digital Rectal Exam (“DRE”) status (nodule / no nodule), and prior negative biopsy status (yes / no) using a proprietary algorithm to calculate the risk (probability) of finding a Gleason Score 7 or higher prostate cancer. The four kallikrein panel of biomarkers utilized in the 4Kscore test is based on decades of research conducted by scientists at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and leading European institutions. Investigators at the Lund University, Sweden, University of Turku, Finland and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, have also demonstrated that the 4Kscore test can risk stratify the 20-year risk for development of prostate metastases and mortality in men who present at age 50 or 60 years old with an elevated PSA. 
The 4Kscore test was developed by OPKO and validated in two prospective, blinded studies of 1,012 and 366 men, respectively. The first study was done in collaboration with 26 urology centers across the U.S. and the second study was conducted at eight VA centers in the U.S. with a predominantly African American cohort. African Americans are 1.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than Caucasian men and 2.2 times more likely to die from the disease. Results showed that the 4Kscore test was highly accurate for predicting the presence of high-grade cancer (Gleason score 7 or higher) prior to prostate biopsy, regardless of race. The full data from the blinded, prospective U.S. clinical validation studies have been published in peer reviewed medical journals. 
The clinical data from both studies demonstrated the ability of the 4Kscore test to discriminate between men with high-grade, aggressive prostate cancer and those men who had no findings of cancer or had low-grade or indolent form of the disease. The discrimination, measured by Area Under the Curve (“AUC”) analysis, was greater than 0.80 and is significantly higher than previously developed tests. Furthermore, the 4Kscore test demonstrated excellent risk calibration, indicating the accuracy of the result for an individual patient, both Caucasian and African American. The high value of AUC and the excellent risk calibration make the 4Kscore test result valuable information for the shared decision-making between the urologist and patient on whether or not to perform a prostate biopsy. 
A separate clinical utility study indicated that the 4Kscore test led to 64.6% fewer biopsies. The study, “The 4Kscore® Test Reduces Prostate Biopsy Rates in Community and Academic Urology Practices”, was published in a peer reviewed medical journal. The study, which included 611 patients seen by 35 academic and community urologists across the U.S., evaluated the influence of the 4Kscore test on urologist- patient decisions about whether to perform a biopsy in men who had an abnormal PSA and or DRE result. Test results for patients were stratified into low risk (< 7.5%), intermediate risk (7.5%-19.9%) and high risk (³20%) for developing aggressive prostate cancer. Nearly half (49.3%) of the men were categorized as low risk; 25.7% and 25.0% fell into the intermediate-risk and high-risk categories, respectively. Notably, the 4Kscore test results influenced biopsy decisions in 88.7% of the men. In the three risk groups, a biopsy was avoided in 94.0%, 52.9% and 19.0% of men in the low, intermediate and high-risk categories, respectively. 
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”) included the 4Kscore test as a recommended test in their 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 Guidelines for Prostate Cancer Early Detection. The panel making this recommendation concluded that the 4Kscore test is indicated for use prior to a first prostate biopsy, or after a negative biopsy, to assist patients and physicians in further defining the probability of high-grade cancer. In addition, the European Association of Urology (“EAU”) Prostate Cancer Guidelines Panel included the 4Kscore test in the 2018 EAU Guidelines for Prostate Cancer, concluding that the 4Kscore, as a blood test with greater specificity over the PSA test, is indicated for use prior to a first prostate biopsy or after a negative biopsy to assist patients and physicians in further defining the probability of high-grade cancer. 
We have and will continue to commit substantial efforts to obtaining broad reimbursement coverage for the 4Kscore test. The 4Kscore test has been granted a Category I CPT® code by the AMA (CPT Code 81539). A CPT code is used by insurance companies and government payors to describe health care services and procedures. A Category I CPT code is critical to facilitate reimbursement in government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private insurance programs. We have obtained a positive coverage decision from at least one national private payor and pricing agreements from several regional payors. 
Novitas Solutions, the local Medicare Administrative Contractor (“MAC”) for our laboratory in New Jersey, issued a proposed non-coverage policy for the 4Kscore test in May 2018 subject to a public comment period ending July 5, 2018. We made oral presentations at a Novitas open meeting and submitted substantial evidence and data to address the comments raised in the draft non-coverage determination. In January 2019, Novitas issued a notice of a future non-coverage determination for the 4KScore test to be effective March 20, 2019. We are evaluating options to appeal the decision and undertake other steps with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) in an effort to have this determination rescinded or reversed. We are also developing a strategy to obtain FDA approval for the 4Kscore test, among other efforts, to assist in securing broad reimbursement coverage.
Point-of-Care Diagnostics
OPKO Diagnostics, LLC (“OPKO Diagnostics”), formerly Claros Diagnostics, Inc., has developed a novel diagnostic instrument system to provide rapid, high performance blood test results in the point-of-care setting. The technology only requires a finger stick drop of blood introduced into the test cassette that can then run a quantitative test. The instrument performs the tests on a disposable, one time usable cassette that is a microfluidics-based diagnostic test system. The credit card-sized test cassette works with a sophisticated desktop analyzer to provide high performance quantitative blood test results within minutes and permits the transition of complex immunoassays from the centralized reference laboratory to the physician’s office, hospital nurses station, or other decentralized location. 
We completed multiple in vitro analytical validation and field use tests for the PSA test in mid-2017 and filed the pre-marketing authorization (“PMA”) for the Claros Analyzer and Sangia Total PSA Test with the FDA in November 2017. The key clinical study with patients who were suspicious for prostate cancer found that the Sangia Total PSA test improved the sensitivity of a digital rectal exam (“DRE”) to 91%, detecting 2.9 times the prostate cancers compared to DRE alone.
The FDA approved the PMA for the Sangia Total PSA Test using the Claros Analyzer in January 2019. We also intend to commence a clinical trial of a testosterone diagnostic test for our point-of-care system. We are evaluating commercialization strategies for the Claros system, including expansion of the test menu prior to commercialization.
We are presently working to add additional tests for our point-of-care system, and we believe that there are many more applications for the technology, including infectious disease, cardiology, women’s health and companion diagnostics. 
Pharmaceutical Business
We currently have one commercial stage pharmaceutical product and several pharmaceutical compounds and technologies in various stages of research and development for a broad range of indications and conditions, including the following:
Renal Products
We launched Rayaldee, our lead renal product, in the U.S. market in November 2016. In June 2016, the FDA approved Rayaldee extended release capsules for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (“SHPT”) in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease (“CKD”) and vitamin D insufficiency, defined as serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL. Rayaldee is a patented extended release product containing 30 mcg of a prohormone called calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3). 
We have a 79-person highly specialized sales, marketing and market access team dedicated to the launch and commercialization of Rayaldee as of December 31, 2018. As compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and the third quarter of 2018, total Rayaldee prescriptions increased approximately 141% and 17%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2018. Efforts are underway to obtain broader commercial and Part D insurance coverage for Rayaldee. We have already contracted for commercial and Part D coverage for more than seventy percent (70%) of U.S. covered lives as of the end of 2018. 
In connection with the launch of Rayaldee, we have also engaged in a comprehensive ongoing market education campaign highlighting the unmet need in treating SHPT, including by leveraging key opinion leaders in community outreach programs such as speakers’ bureaus and patient advocacy programs. 
In May 2016, we entered into a collaboration with Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma (“VFMCRP”) for the development and commercialization of Rayaldee in Europe, Canada, Mexico, Australia, South Korea and certain other international markets for the treatment of SHPT in patients with stage 3, 4 or 5 CKD and vitamin D insufficiency. Under the terms of the agreement, OPKO received an upfront payment of $50 million. We also received a $2 million payment triggered by the marketing approval of Rayaldee in Canada and will receive up to $230 million in additional regulatory and sales-based milestones. In addition, VFMCRP will pay OPKO tiered, double digit royalties on sales of the product at percentage rates that range from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties or a minimum royalty, whichever is greater, upon commencement of sales of the product. OPKO and VFMCRP are also collaborating to develop and commercialize a new dosage form of Rayaldee for the treatment of SHPT in hemodialysis patients. OPKO granted VFMCRP an option to acquire rights to this dosage form for the U.S. market; if exercised, OPKO will receive up to $555 million in additional milestones and double digit royalties. 
On October 12, 2017, we entered into a Development and License Agreement (the “JT Agreement”) with Japan Tobacco Inc. (“JT”) granting JT the exclusive rights for the development and commercialization of Rayaldee in Japan (the “JT Territory”). The license grant to JT covers the therapeutic and preventative use of the product for (i) SHPT in non-dialysis and dialysis patients with CKD, (ii) rickets and (iii) osteomalacia, as well as such additional indications as may be added to the scope of the license subject to the terms of the JT Agreement. Under the terms of the JT Agreement, OPKO received an initial upfront payment of $6 million and received another $6 million milestone payment triggered by the initiation of OPKO’s U.S. phase 2 study with Rayaldee in dialysis patients. OPKO is also eligible to receive up to an additional aggregate amount of $31 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory and development milestones by JT for Rayaldee in the JT Territory, and $75 million upon the achievement of certain sales based milestones by JT in the JT Territory. OPKO will also receive tiered, double digit royalty payments at rates ranging from low double digits to mid-teens on net product sales within the JT Territory. JT will, at its sole cost and expense, be responsible for performing all development activities necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals for Rayaldee in Japan and for all commercial activities pertaining to Rayaldee in Japan, except for certain preclinical expenses which OPKO has agreed to reimburse JT up to a capped amount. 
The FDA approval of Rayaldee was supported by successful results from two identical randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 studies which established the safety and efficacy of Rayaldee as a new treatment for SHPT in adults with stage 3 or 4 CKD and vitamin D insufficiency. 
Vitamin D insufficiency arises in CKD due to the abnormal upregulation of CYP24A1, an enzyme that destroys vitamin D and its metabolites, and from many other causes as well. 
Studies in CKD patients have demonstrated that currently available over-the-counter and prescription vitamin D supplements cannot reliably raise blood vitamin D prohormone levels and effectively treat SHPT, a condition commonly associated with CKD in which the parathyroid glands secrete excessive amounts of PTH. Prolonged elevation of blood PTH causes excessive calcium and phosphorus to be released from bone, leading to elevated serum calcium and phosphorus levels, softening of the bones (osteomalacia) and calcification of vascular and renal tissues. SHPT affects 40-82% of patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD and approximately 95% of patients with stage 5 CKD. 
The completed phase 3 trials for Rayaldee successfully met all primary efficacy and safety endpoints. The primary efficacy endpoint was a responder analysis in which “responder” was defined as any treated subject who demonstrated an average decrease in PTH of at least 30% from pre-treatment baseline during the last six weeks of the 26-week treatment period. A significantly higher response rate was observed with Rayaldee compared to placebo treatment in both trials and safety and 
tolerability data were comparable in both treatment groups. The PTH-lowering response rates with Rayaldee were similar in both stage 3 and 4 CKD. Patients completing the two pivotal trials were treated, at their election, for an additional six months with Rayaldee during an open-label extension study. Data from the extension study indicated that the PTH lowering response rate steadily increased with duration of Rayaldee treatment without deterioration in safety profile. 
We also are developing Rayaldee for other indications, including for SHPT in patients with vitamin D insufficiency and stage 5 CKD requiring regular hemodialysis. A phase 2 study of a higher dose product commenced in this patient population during the third quarter of 2018. We expect to receive data from the study in the second half of 2020. 
In August 2014, we also announced the submission of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) to the FDA to evaluate Rayaldee as an adjunctive therapy for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases undergoing anti-resorptive therapy. We commenced a phase 1 dose escalation study in the fourth quarter of 2014 in breast and prostate cancer patients with bone metastases who were receiving anti-resorptive therapy. The study, which has been completed, was designed to evaluate safety, markers of vitamin D and mineral metabolism and tumor progression. We are currently collecting the final data and will shortly complete a final analysis of the study. 
We filed an IND for Rayaldee in January 2019 for the treatment of SHPT arising from vitamin D insufficiency in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery. We intend to commence a phase 2 study in this population in the first half of 2019. 
Another renal product in our development pipeline, Alpharen (Fermagate Tablets), is a new and potent non-absorbed phosphate binder to treat hyperphosphatemia in stage 5 CKD patients requiring regular hemodialysis. Alpharen (Fermagate Tablets) has been shown to be safe and effective in treating hyperphosphatemia in phase 2 and 3 trials in stage 5 CKD patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. Hyperphosphatemia, or elevated serum phosphorus, is common in dialysis patients and tightly linked to the progression of SHPT and vascular calcification, both of which drive morbidity and mortality. The kidneys provide the primary route of excretion for excess phosphorus absorbed from ingested food. As kidney function worsens, serum phosphorus levels increase and directly stimulate PTH secretion. Stage 5 CKD patients requiring dialysis must reduce their dietary phosphate intake and usually require regular treatment with orally administered phosphate binding agents to lower serum phosphorus to meet the recommendations of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (“KDIGO”) Clinical Practice Guidelines that elevated serum phosphorus levels should be lowered. Hyperphosphatemia contributes to soft tissue mineralization and affects approximately 90% of dialysis patients. Dialysis patients require ongoing phosphate binder treatment to maintain controlled serum phosphorus levels. An additional phase 3 clinical trial is required to support marketing approvals for Alpharen in North America and in Europe, and the Company is evaluating development opportunities.
We believe the CKD patient population is large and growing as a result of obesity, hypertension and diabetes; therefore this patient population represents a significant global market opportunity. According to the National Kidney Foundation, CKD afflicts over 40 million people in the U.S., including more than 21 million patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD. In stage 5 CKD, kidney function is minimal to absent and most patients require regular dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival. An estimated 71-97% of CKD patients have vitamin D insufficiency which can lead to SHPT and its debilitating consequences. CKD continues to be associated with poor outcomes, reflecting the inadequacies of the current standard of care. 
Vitamin D insufficiency, hyperphosphatemia and SHPT, when inadequately treated, are major contributors to poor CKD outcomes. We intend to develop and commercialize Rayaldee and other renal products to constitute part of the foundation for a new and markedly improved standard of care for CKD patients having SHPT and other renal products. 
SARM 
Through the acquisition of Transition Therapeutics, a Toronto-based biotechnology company, we acquired OPK88004, an orally administered selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) which we have been developing for the treatment of Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH) and other urologic and metabolic conditions. The selective and antagonistic properties of OPK88004 on the prostate appear to be well suited to potentially reduce prostate hyperplasia and volume, as well as provide anabolic therapeutic benefits such as increased lean body mass and physical function, and decreased fat mass in specific patient populations. We believe that SARMs hold considerable promise as a new class of anabolic therapies for a variety of clinical indications, such as frailty and functional limitations associated with aging and chronic illnesses, cancer and osteoporosis. 
A phase 2 study of 350 male subjects for another indication showed significantly increased lean body mass and muscle strength and significant fat mass reduction with no change in lower PSA levels. OPK88004 is currently being studied in a phase 2 study in prostate cancer patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy. The main objective of the study is to examine the effect of OPK88004 on sexual function and quality of life issues associated with this patient population. 
An additional phase 2b study to determine the optimal dose to treat patients with BPH commenced in November 2017 and we completed enrollment and randomized 114 patients in the U.S. in December 2018. The main focus of the study is to 
determine the optimal dose of OPK88004 that will reduce prostate volume and PSA levels, and increase anabolic effects such as lean body and decreased fat mass in BPH patients. As previously reported, blinded data from the phase 2b study have shown significant variability in the measurement of prostate volume, rendering the assessment of prostate volume from treatment impractical. Additionally, a small number of subjects have shown increased liver enzymes. We have suspended the current trial but continue to analyze data relating to the study’s other primary endpoint, the effect of OPK88004 on serum PSA levels, and the secondary endpoints, changes in lean body mass and fat mass. The results of this data analysis are expected in the second quarter of 2019. Additional indications including treatment of symptoms associated with androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients and low testosterone levels, muscle weakness and general frailty in kidney dialysis patients are being planned.
Oxyntomodulin
Our internal product development program is also currently focused on developing a once weekly administered oxyntomodulin for type 2 diabetes and obesity. Our most advanced oxyntomodulin product candidate, OPK88003, a once-weekly administered peptide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and associated obesity, is a dual agonist of the Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucagon receptors. The receptors play an integral role in regulating appetite, food intake, satiety and energy utilization in the body. Stimulating both of the receptors, OPK88003 has the potential to regulate blood glucose. 
OPK88003 has been evaluated in a phase 2 study enrolling 420 type 2 diabetes subjects in a 24 week study consisting of a 12-week randomized blinded stage followed by a 12-week open-label stage. The study included four once-weekly dose arms of OPK88003 (10mg, 15mg, 30mg, 50mg), a placebo arm, and an active comparator arm (exenatide extended release – 2mg). The study was completed in February, 2016. 
Subjects receiving the highest dose of OPK88003 peptide once weekly in the study demonstrated significantly superior weight loss compared with currently approved extended release exenatide and placebo after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. OPK88003 also provided a reduction in HbA1c, a marker of sugar metabolism, similar to exenatide at weeks 12 and 24. 
We have evaluated OPK88003 in a dose escalation phase 2b trial in 110 type 2 diabetics where patients have been treated with a dose escalation regimen over 3 months intended to optimize dose levels, and increase body weight loss and reduce the adverse event profile, such as nausea and vomiting. The patients were treated for a total of 30 weeks in the study. We have completed the study and expect to have topline data from the study in March 2019. The key primary endpoint will be HbA1c and secondary endpoints such as weight loss, lipid profile and safety will also be analyzed. 
We believe oxyntomodulin has potential to be a safe, long term therapy for obesity and diabetes type II patients, representing significant market opportunities. More than 380 million are living with diabetes worldwide, of which approximately 90% have type II diabetes. According to the World Health Organization, there are more than 500 million severely overweight or obese people. 
Biologics 
Our biologics business focuses on developing and commercializing longer-acting proprietary versions of already approved therapeutic proteins. One of our innovative platform technologies uses a short, naturally-occurring amino acid sequence, carboxl terminal peptide (“CTP”) which has the effect of slowing the removal from the body of the therapeutic protein to which it is attached. This CTP can be readily attached to a wide array of existing therapeutic proteins, stabilizing the therapeutic protein in the bloodstream and extending its life span without additional toxicity or loss of desired biological activity. We are using the CTP technology to develop new, proprietary versions of certain existing therapeutic proteins that have longer life spans than therapeutic proteins without CTP. We believe that our products will have greatly improved therapeutic profiles and distinct market advantages.
hGH-CTP
Our lead product candidate utilizing CTP, hGH-CTP, is a recombinant human growth hormone product under development for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency (“GHD”), which is a pituitary disorder resulting in short stature in children and other physical ailments in both children and adults. 
In December 2014, we entered into an exclusive worldwide agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of hGH-CTP for the treatment of GHD in adults (“Adult GHD”) and in children (“Pediatric GHD”), as well as for the treatment of growth failure in children born small for gestational age (“SGA”). In connection with the transaction, we granted Pfizer an exclusive license to commercialize hGH-CTP worldwide, and we received non-refundable and non-creditable upfront payments of $295 million and are eligible to receive up to an additional $275 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. In addition, we are eligible to receive initial tiered royalty payments associated with the commercialization of hGH-CTP for Adult GHD with percentage rates ranging from the high teens to mid-twenties. Upon the 
launch of hGH-CTP for Pediatric GHD in certain major markets, the royalties will transition to regional, tiered gross profit sharing for both hGH-CTP and Pfizer’s Genotropin®. 
Pursuant to our agreement with Pfizer, we agreed to lead the clinical development activities for the hGH-CTP program and are responsible for funding the development programs for the key indications, including Adult and Pediatric GHD and Pediatric SGA. Pfizer agreed to be responsible for all development costs for additional indications as well as all post-marketing studies. In addition, Pfizer agreed to fund the commercialization activities for all indications and lead the manufacturing activities covered by the global development plan. The agreement obligated us to fund development up to an agreed cap. We have exceeded the development cap and if we are unable to reach an agreement with Pfizer regarding cost sharing for the overruns, as well as other obligations, including development obligations, it could have a material adverse impact on the expected benefits of the Pfizer transaction.
GHD occurs when the production of growth hormone, secreted by the pituitary gland, is disrupted. Since growth hormone plays a critical role in stimulating body growth and development, and is involved in the production of muscle protein and in the breakdown of fats, a decrease in the hormone affects numerous body processes. hGH is used for the long-term treatment of children and adults with inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone. The primary indications it treats in children are GHD, SGA, kidney disease, Prader-Willi Syndrome and Turner’s Syndrome. In adults, the primary indications are replacement of endogenous growth hormone and the treatment of AIDS-induced weight loss. Patients using hGH receive daily injections six or seven times a week. This is particularly burdensome for pediatric patients. We believe a significant market opportunity exists for a longer-lasting version of hGH that would require fewer injections. 
Our phase 3 trial of hGH-CTP in pediatric patients was initiated in December 2016 and patient enrollment was completed in August 2018. The global study is a 225-patient study in Pediatric GHD patients designed to evaluate weekly treatment with hGH-CTP versus daily injections of Genotropin. The hGH-CTP is delivered in a pen device in this multi-regional study in over 21 countries. The GHD subjects will be treated weekly for 12 months. We expect to perform top-line data analysis from the study in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition to the phase 3 pediatric study, we have continued without interruption our ongoing phase 2 pediatric open label extension study for hGH-CTP. The phase 2 pediatric patients have been treated with hGH-CTP for over four years, and some patients for over five years. We have switched all of the pediatric patients in this study to the disposable pen device. We have also initiated a 44-patient study in Pediatric GHD patients in Japan which has completed enrollment. hGH-CTP has orphan drug designation in the U.S. and Europe for both adults and children with GHD. 
In December 2016, we announced preliminary topline data from our phase 3, double blind, placebo controlled study of hGH-CTP in adults with GHD. The multinational, multi-center study, which utilized a 2:1 randomization between hGH-CTP and placebo, enrolled 203 subjects, 198 of whom received at least one dose of study treatment. Treatment was administered through a weekly injection. The topline results showed: 
•The active group had a mean change in trunk fat mass of -0.4kg and placebo group was 0;
•There was no statistically significant difference (≤ 0.05 (p value)) between the active and placebo group; 
•97% of hGH-CTP vs 6% of placebo group showed IGF-1 normalization; and
•The safety profile of hGH-CTP is consistent with that observed with those treated with daily growth hormone 
Although there was no statistically significant difference between hGH-CTP and placebo on the primary endpoint of change in trunk fat mass from baseline to 26 weeks, after unblinding the study, we identified an exceptional value of trunk fat mass reduction in the placebo group that may have affected the primary outcome. We have completed post-hoc sensitivity analyses to evaluate the influence of outliers on the primary endpoint results using multiple statistical approaches. Analyses that excluded outliers showed a statistically significant difference between hGH-CTP and placebo on the change in trunk fat mass. Additional analyses that did not exclude outliers showed mixed results. Following completion of the analyses, OPKO and Pfizer have agreed that OPKO may communicate with the FDA regarding a potential biologics license application (“BLA”) submission. 
Factor VII
In addition to hGH-CTP, we are developing a product to extend the life span of Factor VIIa (hemophilia) using the CTP technology. In February 2013, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to our longer-acting version of clotting Factor VIIa, Factor VIIa-CTP, for the treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX. Currently, Factor VIIa therapy is available only as an intravenous (IV) formulation which, due to Factor VIIa’s short half-life, requires multiple infusions to treat a bleeding episode. In addition, frequent infusions are onerous when used as preventative prophylactic therapy, especially for children. 
We have conducted a phase 1/2a dose escalation study and a phase 1 dose escalating subcutaneous study in healthy volunteers to determine safety of our long acting Factor VIIa-CTP for the treatment of bleeding episodes in hemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX. These two studies are completed, and data assessment is ongoing. Further regulatory and development strategies will be planned. 
We believe that the CTP technology may also be broadly applicable to other therapeutic proteins in the market and provide a reduction in the number of injections.
APIs
FineTech Pharmaceutical, Ltd. (“FineTech”), is our Israeli-based subsidiary that develops and produces high value, high potency specialty APIs. Through its FDA registered facility in Nesher, Israel, FineTech currently manufactures commercial APIs for sale or license to pharmaceutical companies in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Israel. We believe that FineTech’s significant know-how and experience with analytical chemistry and organic syntheses, together with its production capabilities, may play a valuable role in the development of our pipeline of proprietary molecules and compounds for diagnostic and therapeutic products, while providing revenues and profits from its existing API business.
Oligonucleotide Therapeutics
OPKO CURNA, LLC (“CURNA”), previously CURNA Inc., is engaged in the discovery of new drugs for the treatment of a wide variety of illnesses, including cancer, heart disease, metabolic disorders and a range of genetic anomalies. CURNA’s platform technology utilizes a short, single strand oligonucleotide and is based on the up-regulation of protein production through interference with non-coding RNA’s or natural antisense. This strategy contrasts with established approaches which down-regulate protein production. CURNA has designed a novel type of therapeutic modality, termed AntagoNAT, and has initially demonstrated this approach for up-regulation of several therapeutically relevant proteins in in vitro and animal models. 
CURNA has identified and developed potential active compounds which increase the production of over 80 key proteins involved in a large number of individual diseases. We have ongoing pre-clinical studies for several of these compounds. A lead compound has been identified for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome. Orphan disease designations are granted by FDA and EMA. 
NK-1 Program
We acquired rolapitant and other neurokinin-1 (“NK-1”) assets from Merck & Co. In December 2010, we exclusively out-licensed the development, manufacture and commercialization of our lead NK-1 candidate, VARUBI™ (rolapitant), to TESARO, Inc. (“TESARO”). VARUBI™, a potent and selective competitive antagonist of the NK-1 receptor, had successfully completed clinical testing for prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (“CINV”) and post-operative induced nausea and vomiting. TESARO’s NDA for oral VARUBI™ was approved by the FDA in September 2015, and in November 2015, TESARO commenced the commercial launch of oral VARUBI™ in the U.S. TESARO’s IV formulation of VARUBI™ was approved by the FDA in October 2017 and commercial sales commenced in November 2017. In January 2018, the package insert for VARUBI™ was updated to include mention of new adverse effects, including anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock and other serious hypersensitivity reactions which were reported following its introduction to the market in November 2017. In late February 2018, TESARO announced it would suspend distribution of VARUBI™ IV, but would continue to support the oral product. 
Under the terms of the license, we received a $6.0 million upfront payment from TESARO and we received $30.0 million of milestone payments upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sale milestones. We are eligible to receive additional commercial milestone payments of up to $85.0 million if specified levels of annual net sales are achieved. TESARO is also obligated to pay us tiered royalties on annual net sales achieved in the U.S. and Europe at percentage rates that range from the low double digits to the low twenties, and outside of the U.S. and Europe at low double-digit percentage rates. TESARO assumed responsibility for clinical development and commercialization of licensed products at its expense. Under the agreement, we will continue to receive royalties on a county-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of the date that all of the patents rights licensed from us and covering rolapitant expire, are invalidated or are not enforceable, and 12 years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product. 
If TESARO elects to develop and commercialize VARUBI™ in Japan through a third-party licensee, TESARO will share equally with us all amounts it receives in connection with such activities, subject to certain exceptions and deductions. The term of the license will remain in force until the expiration of the royalty term unless we terminate the license earlier for TESARO’s material breach of the license or bankruptcy. TESARO has a right to terminate the license during the term for any reason on three month’s written notice. 
In June 2018, TESARO assigned its rights and obligations under the agreement to TerSera Therapeutics LLC (“TerSera”) pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. Under the asset purchase agreement, TerSera is responsible for VARUBI in the U.S.and Canada and TESARO can continue to commercialize VARUBY® in Europe and the rest of the world though a sublicense with TerSera. 
Commercial Operations
We also intend to continue to leverage our global commercialization expertise to pursue acquisitions of commercial businesses that will both drive our growth and provide geographically diverse sales and distribution opportunities. During 2015, we acquired EirGen Pharma Ltd. (“EirGen”), a specialty pharmaceutical company based in Ireland. EirGen is focused on the development and commercial supply of high potency, high barrier to entry, pharmaceutical products. Through its facility in Waterford, Ireland, EirGen currently manufactures high potency pharmaceutical products and exports to over 50 countries. High potency drugs such as those used for cancer chemotherapy are typically unsuitable for manufacture in normal multi-product facilities due to cross contamination risks. 
To date, EirGen and its commercial partners have filed several product applications with the FDA in Europe and in Japan. EirGen has a strong research and development portfolio of high barrier to entry drugs and we expect to rapidly expand its drug portfolio. We believe EirGen will play an important role in the development, manufacturing, distribution and approval of a wide variety of drugs in a variety of dosage forms with an emphasis on high potency products. 
OPKO Health Europe (previously Farmadiet Group Holding, S.L.) operates primarily in Spain and has more than 20 years of experience in the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and veterinary products in Europe. 
OPKO Mexico (previously Pharmacos Exakta S.A. de C.V.), is engaged in the manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of ophthalmic and other pharmaceutical products to private and public customers in Mexico. OPKO Mexico is commercializing food supplements and over the counter products, and manufactures and sells products primarily in the generics market in Mexico, although it also has some proprietary products as well. 
OPKO Chile (previously Pharma Genexx, S.A.) markets, sells and distributes pharmaceutical products to the private, hospital, pharmacy and public institutional markets in Chile for a wide range of indications, including, cardiovascular products, vaccines, antibiotics, gastro- intestinal products and hormones, among others. ALS Distribuidora Limitada (“ALS”) is engaged in the business of importation, commercialization and distribution of pharmaceutical products for private markets in Chile. ALS started operations in 2009 as the exclusive product distributor of Arama Laboratorios y Compañía Limitada (“Arama”), a company with more than 20 years of experience in the pharmaceutical products market. In connection with the acquisition of ALS, OPKO acquired all of the product registrations and trademarks previously owned by Arama, as well as the Arama name. We distribute food supplements and over the counter products through Arama. 
Strategic Investments
We have and may continue to make investments in other early stage companies that we perceive to have valuable proprietary technology and significant potential to create value for OPKO as a shareholder. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we incurred $125.6 million, $126.4 million, and $113.9 million, respectively, of research and development expenses related to our various product candidates. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our research and development expenses primarily consisted of hGH-CTP and Rayaldee development programs, including expenses related to the development of hGH-CTP and phase 3 clinical trials for Rayaldee. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We believe that technology innovation is driving breakthroughs in healthcare. We have adopted a comprehensive intellectual property strategy which blends the efforts to innovate in a focused manner with the efforts of our business development activities to strategically in-license intellectual property rights. We develop, protect, and defend our own intellectual property rights as dictated by the developing competitive environment. We value our intellectual property assets and believe we have benefited from early and insightful efforts at understanding diagnostics, as well as the disease and the molecular basis of potential pharmaceutical intervention.
We actively seek, when appropriate and available, protection for our products and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and contractual arrangements. Patent protection in the 
pharmaceutical and diagnostic fields, however, can involve complex legal and factual issues. There can be no assurance that any steps taken to protect such proprietary information will be effective.
We own or license-in thousands of U.S. and foreign patents and applications for our products, product candidates and our outlicensed product candidates. These patents cover pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and other products and their uses, pharmaceutical and diagnostic compositions and formulations and product manufacturing processes. Our patents are filed in various locations worldwide as is appropriate to the particular patent and its use. 
Rayaldee
We have multiple U.S. patent families relating to Rayaldee. These patents are also filed in multiple countries worldwide. One patent family claims a sustained release oral dosage formulation and a method of treating 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency or deficiency and will not expire until at least February 2027. A second patent family claims a method of administering 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 by controlled release, a formulation for controlled release of a vitamin D compound, a controlled release oral dosage formulation of a vitamin D compound and a method of treatment, and will not expire until at least April 2028. We also have additional patents and patent applications pending relating to the sustained release formulation and its use which will expire in 2034 and have licensed patents covering the capsule shell. The patents issued in the U.S. covering Rayaldee are listed in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or the Orange Book. OPKO and/or its affiliates have entered into two exclusive license agreements with respect to Rayaldee patents in certain territories outside of North America with VFMCRP (Europe plus) and JT (Japan). 
Rolapitant
The rolapitant line of patents, exclusively licensed to TESARO and TerSera includes multiple patent families that cover anti-nausea treatment for chemotherapy patients. These U.S. patents are also filed and granted in many countries around the world. One patent family covers the chemical composition of rolapitant and related compounds and expires in December 2023 (with the patent term adjustment). A patent term extension request was submitted to the USPTO in October 2015 to obtain an additional 1,716 days which will, upon approval, extend the rolapitant compound patent expiration date to August 2028.The second patent family covers pharmaceutical formulations, including a capsule formulation with a related method of use and expires in April of 2027. The third patent family covers particular aspects of the chemical composition of rolapitant as well as certain methods of treating delayed onset nausea and expires in April 2027. The fourth patent family covers a powdered pharmaceutical composition of a crystalline salt of rolapitant and expires in March 2028. The current line of rolapitant patents are approved for oral treatment. Patents and applications directed towards the IV formulation of rolapitant are granted and/or currently pending in multiple jurisdictions. 
hGH-CTP
The hGH-CTP line of patents, which is currently licensed to Pfizer, Inc., includes two main patent families that cover modified human grown hormone treatment. These U.S. patents are also filed in multiple countries around the world. One patent family covers certain CTP modified hGH polypeptides relating to growth hormones and their method of use and expires in February of 2027 (with the exception of two U.S. patents, namely US 8304386 and US 8097435, which expire in January 2028 and April 2027, respectively, due to Patent Term Adjustment for each). The second patent family covers cytokine-based polypeptides relating to human growth hormone treatment and expires in 2027. In addition to the CTP patents and applications licensed to Pfizer, OPKO has multiple patent families covering similar biologicals with patents and applications pending in the U.S. and internationally.
OPK88003 and OPK88004
In 2016, we acquired Transition Therapeutics, Inc. which is developing multiple drug candidates that include OPK88003 (a long acting oxyntomodulin) and OPK88004 (a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM)), each of which are licensed from Eli Lilly and have granted patents worldwide covering the compounds and their use in their respective indications. U.S. Pat. No. 8367607 covers OPK88003 and expires in December 2030, without extension. U.S. Pat. No. 7968587 covers OPK88004 and expires, without extension, in November 2027. In addition to the molecule patent covering the selective androgen receptor modulator, Transition Therapeutics exclusively licensed a method of use patent family covering its use in treating androgen deprivation therapy associated symptoms. These patents expire in 2035. In addition, Transition and its affiliates have patented compounds (scyllo-inositol) for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The patents are pending or granted in many countries of the world. We and/or our affiliates will seek all available patent term extensions for our product candidates and products.
Because the patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostics companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, the patents owned and licensed by us, or any future patents, may not prevent other 
companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products or ensure that others will not be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties. Furthermore, to the extent that any of our future products or methods are not patentable, that such products or methods infringe upon the patents of third parties, or that our patents or future patents fail to give us an exclusive position in the subject matter claimed by those patents, we will be adversely affected. We may be unable to avoid infringement of third party patents and may have to obtain a license, defend an infringement action, or challenge the validity of the patents in court. A license may be unavailable on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming, and we may be unable to prevail in any such patent litigation or devote sufficient resources to even pursue such litigation.
LICENSES AND COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS
Our strategy is to develop a portfolio of product candidates through a combination of internal development, acquisition, and external partnerships. Collaborations are key to our strategy and we continue to build relationships and forge partnerships in various areas where unmet medical need and commercial opportunities exist. In October 2017, we entered into a license and development agreement with JT for the development and commercialization of Rayaldee in Japan for the treatment of SHPT in non-dialysis and dialysis patients with CKD. In May 2016, we entered into a license and collaboration with VFMCRP for the development and commercialization of Rayaldee in Europe, Canada, Mexico, Australia, South Korea and certain other international markets for the treatment of SHPT in patients with CKD and vitamin D insufficiency. In December 2014, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of our long-acting hGH-CTP for the treatment of GHD in adults and children, as well as for the treatment of growth failure in children born small for gestational age. Previously, we (or entities we have acquired) have completed strategic licensing transactions with the President and Fellows of Harvard College, Academia Sinica, The Scripps Research Institute, TESARO, INEOS Healthcare, and Arctic Partners, among others. 
COMPETITION
The pharmaceutical and diagnostic testing industries are highly competitive and require an ongoing, extensive search for technological innovation. The industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. They also require, among other things, the ability to effectively discover, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products, as well as the ability to effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products.
Numerous companies, including major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, are engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products competitive with those that we are or intend to commercialize ourselves and through our partners. Competitors to our diagnostics business include major diagnostic companies, reference laboratories, molecular diagnostic firms, universities and research institutions. Most of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations than ours. This enables them, among other things, to make greater research and development investments and efficiently utilize their research and development costs, as well as their marketing and promotion costs, over a broader revenue base. This also provides our competitors with a competitive advantage in connection with the highly competitive product acquisition and product in-licensing process, which may include auctions in which the highest bidder wins. Our competitors may also have more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition to product development, testing, approval, and promotion, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical and diagnostics industry include industry consolidation, product quality and price, product technology, reputation, customer service, and access to technical information.
In our clinical laboratory operations, we compete with three types of providers in a highly fragmented and competitive industry: hospital laboratories, physician-office laboratories and other independent clinical laboratories. Our major competitors in the New York metropolitan area are two of the largest national laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America. Although we are much smaller than these national laboratories, we believe that we compete successfully with them in our region due to our innovative testing services and our level of service. We believe our responses to medical consultation are faster and more personalized than those of the national laboratories. Our client service staff deals only with basic technical questions and those that have medical or scientific significance are referred directly to our senior scientists and medical staff.
We are commercializing our 4Kscore product in the U.S., Europe and Mexico in a laboratory setting and seek to capitalize on near-term commercialization opportunities for our proprietary diagnostic point-of-care system by transitioning laboratory-based tests, including the PSA, and testosterone and other tests to our point-of-care system. We expect to leverage BioReference’s national marketing, sales and distribution resources, along with its almost 300-person sales and marketing team 
to support commercialization of the 4Kscore and other diagnostic products. Competitors to our diagnostics business are many and include major diagnostic companies, molecular diagnostic firms, universities, and research institutions. 
Pricing and reimbursement coverage positions, including the recent future non-coverage determination by Novitas, could substantially impact the competitiveness of the 4Kscore test and our other diagnostic products. See “Risk Factors - If the 4Kscore test is not covered and eligible for reimbursement from government and third party payors, we may not be able to generate significant revenue for the product.”
Our ability to commercialize our pharmaceutical and diagnostic test product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in large part, on:

• | our ability to meet all necessary regulatory requirements to advance our product candidates through clinical trials and the regulatory approval process in the U.S. and abroad;


• | the perception by physicians and other members of the health care community of the safety, efficacy, and benefits of our products compared to those of competing products or therapies;


• | our ability to manufacture products we may develop on a commercial scale;


• | the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;


• | the willingness of physicians to adopt a new diagnostic or treatment regimen represented by our technology;


• | our ability to secure reimbursement for our product candidates;


• | the price of the products we may develop and commercialize relative to competing products;


• | our ability to accurately forecast and meet demand for our product candidates if regulatory approvals are achieved;


• | our ability to develop a commercial scale infrastructure either on our own or with a collaborator, which would include expansion of existing facilities, including our manufacturing facilities, development of a sales and distribution network, and other operational and financial systems necessary to support our increased scale;


• | our ability to maintain a proprietary position in our technologies; and


• | our ability to rapidly expand the existing information technology infrastructure and configure existing operational, manufacturing, and financial systems (on our own or with third party collaborators) necessary to support our increased scale, which would include existing or additional facilities and or partners.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
The U.S. government regulates healthcare through various agencies, including but not limited to the following: (i) the FDA, which administers the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), as well as other relevant laws; (ii) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), which administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (iii) the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), which enforces various laws aimed at curtailing fraudulent or abusive practices, including by way of example, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly referred to as the Stark law, the Civil Monetary Penalty Law (including the beneficiary inducement prohibition) (“CMP”), and the laws that authorize the OIG to exclude healthcare providers and others from participating in federal healthcare programs; and (iv) the Office of Civil Rights, which administers the privacy aspects of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. All of the aforementioned are agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). Healthcare is also provided or regulated, as the case may be, by the Department of Defense through its TRICARE program, the Department of Veterans Affairs, especially through the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, the Public Health Service within HHS under Public Health Service Act § 340B (42 U.S.C. § 256b), the Department of Justice through the Federal False Claims Act and various criminal statutes, and state governments under the Medicaid and other state sponsored or funded programs and their internal laws regulating all healthcare activities.
The testing, manufacture, distribution, advertising, and marketing of drug and diagnostic products and medical devices, as well as the performance of clinical testing services, are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and local governmental authorities in the U.S., including the FDA, and by similar agencies in other countries. Any drug, diagnostic, or device product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country.
Clinical Laboratory Operations
Our clinical laboratory operations are subject to regulations, which are designed to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. Laboratories must undergo on-site surveys at least every two years, which may be conducted by CMS under the Federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) program or by a private CMS approved accrediting agency. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. We are also subject to regulation of laboratory operations under state clinical laboratory laws. State clinical laboratory laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. Certain states, such as New York, California, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, each require that we obtain licenses to test specimens from patients residing in those states and additional states may require similar licenses in the future. Only Washington and New York State are exempt under CLIA, as these states have established laboratory quality standards at least as stringent as CLIA’s. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations.
Our clinical laboratory operations are subject to complex laws, regulations and licensure requirements relating to billing and payment for laboratory services, sales and marketing interactions with ordering physicians and other health care providers, security and confidentiality of health information, and environmental and occupational safety, among others. Changes in regulations often increase the cost of testing or processing claims. Also, these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including in our pricing, billing and/or marketing practices in a manner that could adversely affect operations. 
Drug Development
The regulatory process, which includes overseeing preclinical studies and clinical trials of each pharmaceutical compound to establish its safety and efficacy and confirmation by the FDA that good laboratory, clinical, and manufacturing practices were maintained during testing and manufacturing, can take many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources, and gives larger companies with greater financial resources a competitive advantage over us. Delays or terminations of clinical trials that we undertake would likely impair our development of product candidates. Delays or terminations could result from a number of factors, including stringent enrollment criteria, slow rate of enrollment, size of patient population, having to compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, geographical considerations, failure to meet anticipated clinical success, patient safety concerns, and others.
Although accelerated pathways for approval exist for certain drugs, generally, FDA review processes can be lengthy and unpredictable, and we may encounter delays or rejections of our applications when submitted. Generally, in order to gain FDA approval, we must first conduct preclinical studies in a laboratory and in animal models to obtain preliminary information on a compound and to identify any safety problems. The results of these studies are submitted as part of an IND application that the FDA must review before human clinical trials of an investigational drug can commence.
Clinical trials are normally done in three sequential phases and generally take two to five years or longer to complete. phase 1 consists of testing the drug product in a small number of humans, normally healthy volunteers, to determine preliminary safety and tolerable dose range. Phase 2 usually involves studies in a limited patient population to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug product in humans having the disease or medical condition for which the product is indicated, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible common adverse effects and safety risks. Phase 3 consists of additional controlled testing at multiple clinical sites to establish clinical safety and effectiveness in an expanded patient population of geographically dispersed test sites to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship for administering the product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted- and are sometimes required - after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. There are also certain situations when drugs and biologics are eligible for one of FDA’s expedited approval programs, designed to shorten review and development time.
After completion of clinical trials of a new drug product, FDA and foreign regulatory authority marketing approval must be obtained. Assuming that the clinical data support the product’s safety and effectiveness for its intended use, a Biologics License Application (BLA) or an NDA is submitted to the FDA for its review. Since the early 1990s, the FDA has managed a user fee program whereby sponsors of drug applications pay a fee to the agency and the agency commits to meeting a series of performance goals designed to reduce drug review times. Generally, it takes one to three years to obtain approval. If questions arise during the FDA review process, approval may take a significantly longer period of time. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and we may not receive approval on a timely basis, if at all, or the approval that we receive may be for a narrower indication than we had originally sought, potentially undermining the commercial viability of the product. Even if regulatory approvals are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of 
previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. For marketing outside the U.S., we also will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary widely from country to country.
In addition to clinical trial rules, FDA imposes other requirements on applicants including obligations related to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), proper labeling, and other issues related to manufacturing and marketing a drug. 
Other than Rayaldee, none of our pharmaceutical products under development have been approved for marketing in the U.S. or elsewhere. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any such products under development in a timely manner, if at all. Failure to obtain requisite governmental approvals or failure to obtain approvals of the scope requested will delay or preclude us, or our licensees or marketing partners, from marketing our products, or limit the commercial use of our products, and thereby would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See “Risk Factors — The results of pre-clinical trials and previous clinical trials for our products may not be predictive of future results, and our current and planned clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities.”
Device Development
Medical devices are subject to varying levels of premarket regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires human clinical trials be conducted before a device receives approval for commercial distribution. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based upon their risk profile (both to the patient and provider): Class I devices are relatively simple “low risk” technologies, and can be manufactured and distributed with general controls without a premarket clearance or approval from the FDA; Class II devices are somewhat more complex “moderate risk” devices, and require greater scrutiny from the agency, requiring a premarket clearance from the FDA before market entry; Class III devices are “high risk” technologies inserted or implanted in the body, intended to treat life sustaining functions. These Class III technologies require a premarket approval from the FDA before market entry.
In the U.S., a company generally can obtain permission to distribute a new device in one of two ways. The first applies to a Class II device that is substantially equivalent to a device first marketed prior to May 1976, or to another device marketed after that date, but which was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 1976 device. To obtain FDA permission to distribute the device, a company generally must submit a section 510(k) premarket notification, and receive an FDA order finding substantial equivalence to a predicate device (pre-May 1976 or post-May 1976 device that was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 1976 device) and permitting commercial distribution of that device for its intended use. A 510(k) submission must provide information supporting a claim of substantial equivalence to the predicate device. If clinical data from human experience are required to support the 510(k) submission, these data must be gathered in compliance with investigational device exemption (“IDE”), regulations for investigations performed in the U.S. The 510(k) process is normally used for products of the type that the Company proposes distributing. The FDA review process for premarket notifications submitted pursuant to section 510(k) takes, on average, about 90 days, but it can take substantially longer if the FDA has concerns, and there is no guarantee that the FDA will “clear” the device for marketing, in which case the device cannot be distributed in the U.S. There is also no guarantee that the FDA will deem the applicable device subject to the 510(k) process, as opposed to the more time-consuming, resource-intensive and problematic, PMA process described below.
The second, more comprehensive, PMA process, which can take a year or longer, applies to a new device that is not substantially equivalent to a pre-1976 product or that is to be used in supporting or sustaining life or preventing impairment. These devices are normally Class III devices. For example, most implantable devices are subject to the approval process. Two steps of FDA approval are generally required before a company can market a product in the U.S. that is subject to approval, as opposed to clearance. First, a company must comply with IDE regulations in connection with any human clinical investigation of the device. These regulations permit a company to undertake a clinical study of a “non-significant risk” device without formal FDA approval. Prior express FDA approval is required if the device is a significant risk device. Second, the FDA must review the company’s PMA application, which contains, among other things, clinical information acquired under the IDE. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The PMA process takes substantially longer than the 510(k) process and it is conceivable that the FDA would not agree with our assessment that a device that we propose to distribute should be a Class I or Class II device. If that were to occur we would be required to undertake the more complex and costly PMA process. However, for either the 510(k) or the PMA process, the FDA could require us to run clinical trials, which would pose all of the same risks and uncertainties associated with the clinical trials of drugs, described above.
In December of 2016, Congress enacted the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) which contained provisions establishing a new Breakthrough Device pathway to allow faster patient access to devices and breakthrough technologies that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis for life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases, for which no approved or cleared treatment exists or that offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives. FDA has just begun to implement this program and it is not clear if any of our products would be eligible.
Even when a clinical study has been approved by the FDA or deemed approved, the study is subject to factors beyond a manufacturer’s control, including, but not limited to the fact that the institutional review board at a given clinical site might not approve the study, might decline to renew approval which is required annually, or might suspend or terminate the study before the study has been completed. Also, the interim results of a study may not be satisfactory, leading the sponsor to terminate or suspend the study on its own initiative or the FDA may terminate or suspend the study. There is no assurance that a clinical study at any given site will progress as anticipated; there may be an insufficient number of patients who qualify for the study or who agree to participate in the study or the investigator at the site may have priorities other than the study. Also, there can be no assurance that the clinical study will provide sufficient evidence to assure the FDA that the product is safe and effective, a prerequisite for FDA approval of a PMA, or substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a predicate device, a prerequisite for clearance under 510(k). Even if the FDA approves or clears a device, it may limit its intended uses in such a way that manufacturing and distributing the device may not be commercially feasible. For marketing outside the U.S., we also will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval for medical devices. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, device clearance/approval, pricing, and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In addition to the regulatory clearance and approval processes described herein, the FDA periodically issues draft guidance documents designed to provide additional detail on or reform aspects of the 510(k) and PMA clearance and approval processes. To the extent the FDA finalizes and implements these documents, the average 510(k) and PMA submission requirements and review times may change and devices that might previously have been cleared under the 510(k) process may require approval under the PMA process (and vice-versa). Additionally, since 2012, the FDA has collected user fees for the review of certain premarket submissions received on or after October 1, 2012, including 510(k) and PMA applications. These fees are intended to improve the device review process, but it is still too early to assess the actual impact on the industry.
After clearance or approval to market is given, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, upon the occurrence of certain events, are authorized under various circumstances to withdraw the clearance or approval or require changes to a device, its manufacturing process or its labeling or additional proof that regulatory requirements have been met.
A manufacturer of a device approved through the PMA is not permitted to make changes to the device, which affects its safety or effectiveness without first submitting a supplement application to its PMA and obtaining FDA approval for that supplement. In some instances, the FDA may require clinical trials to support a supplement application. A manufacturer of a device cleared through the 510(k) process must submit another premarket notification if it intends to make a change or modification in the device that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, such as a significant change or modification in design, material, chemical composition, energy source or manufacturing process. Any change in the intended uses of a PMA device or a 510(k) device requires an approved PMA supplement or a cleared premarket notification. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported, as well as certain FDA export requirements.
A company that intends to manufacture medical devices is required to register with the FDA before it begins to manufacture the device for commercial distribution. As a result, we and any entity that manufactures products on our behalf will be subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation requirements and other regulations. In the European Community, we will be required to maintain certain International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), certifications in order to sell products and we or our manufacturers undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. These regulations require us or our manufacturers to manufacture products and maintain documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, we are required to comply with various FDA and other agency requirements for labeling and promotion. The Medical Device Reporting regulations require that we provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence to reasonably suggest that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. In addition, the FDA prohibits us from promoting a medical device for unapproved indications.
Diagnostic Products
Certain of our diagnostic products in development are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar international health authorities. For these products, we have an obligation to adhere to the FDA’s cGMP regulations. Additionally, we are subject to periodic FDA inspections, quality control procedures, and other detailed validation procedures. If the FDA finds deficiencies in the validation of our manufacturing and quality control practices, they may impose restrictions on marketing specific products until corrected.
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries may be a significant factor in how we develop, test, produce and market our diagnostic test products. Diagnostic tests like ours may not fall squarely within the regulatory approval process for pharmaceutical or device products as described above, and the regulatory pathway is not as clear. Although the FDA regulates in vitro diagnostic devices, some companies have successfully commercialized diagnostic tests for various conditions and disease states without seeking clearance or approval for such tests through a 510(k) or PMA approval process. These tests are known as laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”) and are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory that is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”). CLIA is a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for diagnostic, preventative or treatment purpose. Such LDT testing is currently under the purview of CMS and state agencies that provide oversight of the safe and effective use of LDTs.
However, the FDA has consistently asserted that it has the regulatory authority to regulate LDTs despite historically exercising enforcement discretion. In furtherance of that position, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents in October 2014: (1) Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (the “Framework Guidance”); and (2) FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (the “Notification Guidance”). The Framework Guidance outlines the FDA’s plan to adopt over time a risk-based approach to regulating LDTs whereby different classifications of LDTs would be subject to different levels of FDA oversight and enforcement, including, for example, prohibitions on adulteration and misbranding, establishment registration and device listing, premarket notification, banned devices, records and reports, good manufacturing practices, adverse event reporting, premarket review of safety, effectiveness, and clinical validity, and quality system requirements. The Notification Guidance is intended to explain how clinical laboratories should notify the FDA of the LDTs they develop and how to satisfy Medical Device Reporting requirements. However, the FDA indicated in November 2016 that it would delay implementation of the Framework Guidance and the Notification Guidance, and seek additional input from industry. In addition, on January 13, 2017, the FDA published a synthesis of feedback on the Framework Guidance and Notification Guidance titled, Discussion Paper on Laboratory Developed Tests (the “Discussion Paper”). The Discussion Paper provided notice that the FDA would not issue a final guidance on the oversight of LDTs to allow for further public discussion on appropriate oversight approach, and to give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution. 
If finalized in the October 2014 format, the Framework Guidance and the Notification Guidance may have a materially adverse effect on the time, cost, and risk associated with the Company’s development and commercialization of LDTs for the U.S. market, and there can be no assurance that clearances or approvals sought by the Company will be granted and maintained. However, the FDA’s authority to regulate LDTs continues to be challenged and the regulatory situation remains fluid. The FDA has indicated that it will continue dialogue with the industry, and the timeline and process for finalizing the draft guidance documents is unknown. We will continue to monitor changes to all domestic and international LDT regulatory policy so as to ensure compliance with the current regulatory scheme.
Impact of Regulation
The FDA in the course of enforcing the FDCA may subject a company to various sanctions for violating FDA regulations or provisions of the FDCA, including requiring recalls, issuing Warning Letters, seeking to impose civil money penalties, seizing devices that the agency believes are non-compliant, seeking to enjoin distribution of a specific drug or device seeking to revoke a clearance or approval, seeking disgorgement of profits and seeking to criminally prosecute a company and its officers and other responsible parties.
The levels of revenues and profitability of biopharmaceutical companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of government and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the U.S., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control. In addition, in the U.S. and elsewhere, sales of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products are dependent in part on the availability and adequacy of reimbursement from third party payors, such as the government or private insurance plans. Third party payors are increasingly challenging established prices, and new products that are more expensive than existing treatments may have difficulty finding ready acceptance unless there is a clear therapeutic benefit. On April 1, 
2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”) was enacted into law. Under PAMA, Medicare payment for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests are established by calculating a weighted mean of private payor rates with new rates. Effective January 1, 2018, clinical laboratory fee schedule rates will be based on weighted median private payor rates as required by PAMA. We cannot assure you that any of our products will be considered cost effective, or that reimbursement will be available or sufficient to allow us to sell them competitively and profitably.
State and Federal Security and Privacy Regulations
The privacy and security regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ( the “HITECH Act”, and collectively, “HIPAA”), establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information, or PHI, by health plans and health care providers, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:

• | the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, to obtain payments for services and health care operations activities;


• | a patient’s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI;


• | the content of notices of privacy practices for PHI; and


• | administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive PHI electronically.

The final omnibus rule implementing the HITECH Act took effect on March 26, 2013. The rule is broad in scope, but certain provisions are particularly significant in light of our business operations. For example, the final “omnibus” rule implementing the HITECH Act:

• | Makes clear that situations involving impermissible access, acquisition, use or disclosure of protected health information are now presumed to be a breach unless the covered entity or business associate is able to demonstrate that there is a low probability that the information has been compromised;


• | Defines the term “business associate” to include subcontractors and agents that receive, create, maintain or transmit protected health information on behalf of the business associate;


• | Establishes new parameters for covered entities and business associates on uses and disclosures of PHI for fundraising and marketing; and


• | Establishes clear restrictions on the sale of PHI without patient authorization.

As a provider of clinical laboratory services and as we launch commercial diagnostic tests, we must continue to implement policies and procedures related to compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, as required by law. The privacy and security regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties.
Additionally, as we operate in Europe, we may be subject to laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of personal and/or patient information. In December 2015, the European Union approved a General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) to replace the current data protection directive, Directive 95/46/EC, which took effect May 25, 2018. The GDPR governs the use and transfer of personal data and imposes enhanced penalties for noncompliance. We have made, and will continue to make, certain adjustments to our operations so as to comply with the GDPR.
Anti-Kickback Laws, Physician Self-Referral Laws, False Claims Act, Civil Monetary Penalties
We are also subject to various federal, state, and international laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits anyone from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying any remuneration with the intent to refer, or to arrange for the referral or order of, services or items payable under a federal health care program, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug or the use of a service or device. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, to issue a series of regulations, known as “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth requirements that, if met in their entirety, will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal, or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG.
Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by the imposition of criminal fines, civil money penalties, treble damages, and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Many states have also enacted similar anti-kickback laws. The Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws and regulations are expansive. If the government were to allege against or convict us of violating these laws, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and our stock price. Even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We will consult counsel concerning the potential application of these and other laws to our business and our sales, marketing and other activities and will make good faith efforts to comply with them. However, given the broad reach of federal and state anti-kickback laws and the increasing attention given by law enforcement authorities, we are unable to predict whether any of our activities will be challenged or deemed to violate these laws.
We are also subject to the physician self-referral laws, commonly referred to as the Stark law, which is a strict liability statute that generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to providers of “designated health services,” including clinical laboratories, with whom the physician or the physician’s immediate family member has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement, unless an applicable exception applies. Moreover, many states have adopted or are considering adopting similar laws, some of which extend beyond the scope of the Stark law to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the prohibited referral of patients for designated healthcare services and physician self-referrals, regardless of the source of the payment for the patient’s care. If it is determined that certain of our practices or operations violate the Stark law or similar statutes, we could become subject to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare programs and loss of government reimbursement. The imposition of any such penalties could harm our business.
Another development affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal civil False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act, as amended by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“Affordable Care Act”), imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program. We submit claims for services performed at our laboratories. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal health care program. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly adversely affect our financial performance.
Further, the beneficiary inducement prohibition of the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law prohibits any entity from offering or transferring to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof) and transfers of items or services for free or for other than fair market value. On December 7, 2016, the OIG released amendments to the CMP. Some of the amendments may impact our business, such as allowing certain remuneration to financially needy individuals. Entities found in violation may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act. Although we believe that our sales and marketing practices are in material compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, relevant regulatory authorities may disagree and violation of these laws, or, our exclusion from such programs as Medicaid and other governmental programs as a result of a violation of such laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Open Payments Program
With the launch of Rayaldee, part of our business is now subject to the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, which is implemented though the physicians Open Payments Program (the “Open Payments Program”). The Open Payments Program requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or 
individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals. Manufacturers must also report, on an annual basis, certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other “transfers of value” made to such physician owners. A failure to report each payment, other transfer of value, or ownership/investment interest in a timely, accurate, and complete manner may result in civil monetary penalties of up to $150,000 annually. Further, the “knowing” failure to report each payment, other transfer of value, or ownership/investment interest may result in a one million dollar annual penalty. Several other states and a number of countries worldwide have adopted or are considering the adoption of similar transparency laws. Any failure by us to implement proper procedures to track and report on a timely basis transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals could result in substantial penalties.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors, even though they may not always be subject to our control. We discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees and agents comply with the FCPA and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions.
MANUFACTURING AND QUALITY
Other than our facilities in Waterford, Ireland, Guadalajara, Mexico, Nesher, Israel, and Banyoles, Spain, we currently have no pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. We have entered into agreements with various third parties for the formulation and manufacture of our pharmaceutical clinical supplies. These suppliers and their manufacturing facilities must comply with FDA regulations, current good laboratory practices (“cGLPs”) and current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”). We plan to continue to outsource the manufacturing and formulation of our clinical supplies.
The FDA and similar regulatory bodies may inspect our facilities and the facilities of those who manufacture on our behalf worldwide. If the FDA or similar regulatory bodies inspecting our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers find regulatory violations in manufacturing and quality control practices or procedures they may require us to cease partial or complete manufacturing operations until the violations are corrected. They may also impose restrictions on distribution of specific products until the violations are corrected.
Our point-of-care diagnostic system consists of a disposable test cassette and an analyzer. We prepare all necessary test reagents and assemble and package the disposable cassettes at our facility in Woburn, Massachusetts. We rely on third parties for the manufacture of the analyzer.
We are committed to providing high quality products to our customers, and we plan to meet this commitment by working diligently to continue implementing updated and improved quality systems and concepts throughout our organization.
SALES & MARKETING
Our diagnostics business includes BioReference’s almost 300-person sales and marketing team in the U.S. to drive growth and leverage new products, including the 4Kscore prostate cancer test. We have a highly specialized, field based 79-person sales and marketing team in the U.S. dedicated to the launch and commercialization of Rayaldee. We also have limited sales and marketing personnel in Ireland, Chile, Spain, Mexico and Israel. 
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we had 5,690 full-time employees worldwide. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We require all employees, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer and other senior officers and our employee directors, to read and to adhere to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics in discharging their work-related responsibilities. Employees are required to report any 
conduct that they believe in good faith to be an actual or apparent violation of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our website at http://www.OPKO.com.
