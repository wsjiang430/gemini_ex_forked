OVERVIEW
General
Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. (“BNED”) is one of the largest contract operators of physical and virtual bookstores for college and university campuses and K-12 institutions across the United States. We are also one of the largest textbook wholesalers, inventory management hardware and software providers, and a leading provider of digital education solutions. We operate 1,448 physical, virtual, and custom bookstores and serve more than 6 million students, delivering essential educational content and tools within a dynamic omni channel retail environment. Additionally, we offer direct-to-student products and services to help students study more effectively and improve academic performance. 
The Barnes & Noble and MBS brands are virtually synonymous with bookselling, and, we believe, are widely recognized and respected brands in the United States. Our large college footprint, reputation, and credibility in the marketplace not only support our marketing efforts to universities, students, and faculty, but are also important for leading publishers who rely on us as one of their primary distribution channels, and for being a trusted source for students in our direct-to-student digital solutions business. 
We provide product and service offerings designed to address the most pressing issues in higher education, including affordable and accessible course materials and products designed to drive and improve student outcomes. Students today want to have access to their course materials at an affordable price and in the format of their choice. We focus on providing affordable solutions, such as our First Day™ inclusive access program, in which course materials, including e-content, are offered at a reduced price through a course materials fee, and delivered to students on or before the first day of class. 
Technology-enabled learning is a rapid growth area in the higher education industry, as a growing number of students are enrolling in online services to complement print and digital course materials and classroom activities. We continue to enhance our digital content and services in an efficient, low-cost/high-value manner to complement our course materials business. We offer BNC OER+ which is a turnkey solution for colleges and universities that offers advanced, affordable learning materials built on a high-quality foundation of open educational resource-based (“OER”) or custom developed content from experts and faculty, as well as enhanced with digital content that includes videos, activities and auto-graded practice assessments that faculty can easily customize to align with class objectives. BNC OER+ significantly reduces course material costs for students and enables easier implementation for faculty. 
In Fiscal 2019, we launched bartleby® textbook solutions and a question and answer feature, our first internally developed products, on bartleby.com, providing critical services for students to achieve better success throughout their academic journey. Bartleby is a central offering in our developing ecosystem of direct-to-student digital products and services, accessible anytime and anywhere. We offer these online solutions to students via internet search engine optimization, as well as by marketing directly to students in our physical and virtual bookstore footprint and nationally to students. We have demonstrated positive leverage of our managed bookstore footprint, with subscriber results that exceeded our expectations. Since the launch during the Spring semester of Fiscal 2019, we have achieved over 50,000 customers subscribed for bartleby textbook solutions utilizing marketing and promotional offers, both within our managed bookstore footprint and nationally to students, representing a small percentage of the total addressable market opportunity. 
As demand for new, enhanced, and more affordable products and services increase in the rapidly changing education landscape, we strive to continue to evolve our business model and enhance our solutions. In Fiscal 2019, we combined the retail operations and sales organizations of our physical and virtual bookstore organizations, to focus on strengthening our retail and e-commerce solutions for our institutional partners and customers, and to accelerate our ability to leverage our bookstore footprint to provide digital education solutions. We expect to continue to grow our business by introducing scalable and advanced digital solutions focused largely on the student, increasing market share with new bookstore accounts, and expanding our strategic opportunities. We are leveraging our deep experience in consumer marketing, e-commerce, digital product development and higher education to enhance our existing services and solutions, and develop new assets that will bring the Company to new levels of innovation, growth and profitability.

Segments
We identify our segments in accordance with the way our business is managed (focusing on the financial information distributed) and the manner in which our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses financial performance. 
Prior to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, we had three reportable segments: BNC, MBS, and Digital Student Solutions (“DSS”). During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in an effort to streamline our retail go-to-market strategy, reinforce our company branding, and more efficiently focus our product development efforts, we realigned our business and sales organization into the following three reportable segments: Retail, Wholesale and DSS. The Retail Segment combines the operations of the former BNC segment with MBS Direct (from the former MBS segment), the Wholesale Segment is comprised of the MBS wholesale business (from the former MBS segment), and the DSS Segment remains unchanged. Additionally, unallocated shared-service costs, which include various corporate level expenses and other governance functions, continue to be presented as “Corporate Services”. The following discussion provides information regarding the three segments, with additional information in each respective subsequent segment discussion.
RETAIL SEGMENT
General
The Retail Segment operates 1,448 college, university, and K-12 school bookstores, comprised of 772 physical campus bookstores and 676 virtual bookstores. Our bookstores typically operate under agreements with college, university, or K-12 schools to be the official bookstore and the exclusive seller of course materials and supplies, including physical and digital products. The majority of the physical campus bookstores have school-branded e-commerce sites which we operate and which offer students access to affordable course materials and affinity products, including emblematic apparel and gifts. Our physical and virtual bookstores, e-commerce sites and digital platforms serve and interact with the key constituents in our business ecosystem and enable us to act as a key partner for students, universities and publishers. 
The Retail Segment offers existing and prospective clients the flexibility of physical, virtual or custom store solutions, which afford students a ship-to-campus option where course materials are conveniently delivered to a centralized campus location. Students have access to the right course materials at the right time, combined with a superior in-house customer service department to help with ordering, delivery, and digital content inquiries. Students also have the flexibility of using financial aid for their course material purchases.
The Retail Segment also offers our First Day inclusive access program, in which course materials, including e-content, are offered at a reduced price through a course materials fee, and delivered to students on or before the first day of class. We have entered into several agreements with major publishers, including Cengage Learning, McGraw-Hill Education and Pearson Education, to distribute their content through First Day. In Fiscal 2019, First Day total sales increased by 92% from the prior year.
Additionally, the Retail Segment offers a suite of digital content and services to colleges and universities, including a variety of OER courseware. 
In Fiscal 2019, in the Retail Segment, we signed contracts for 68 new physical and virtual bookstores for estimated first year annual sales of approximately $63 million. Currently, we estimate that over 35% of college and university affiliated bookstores in the United States are operated by their respective institutions. We anticipate the trend towards outsourcing in the campus bookstore market, and we intend to aggressively pursue these opportunities to grow our businesses. We evaluate each new contract based on established profitability measures to ensure we maintain a portfolio of profitable accounts. Our ability to offer existing and prospective clients physical, virtual and custom store solutions is a key element of our competitive strategy.
Contracts
Physical and Custom Campus Bookstore Solutions
We operate 772 physical campus bookstores. Our physical bookstores are typically operated under management agreements with the college or university to be the official university bookstore and the exclusive seller of course materials and supplies, including physical and digital products sold in-store, online or through learning management systems. We pay the school a percentage of sales for the right to be the official college or university bookstore and the use of the premises; more than half of our agreements do not have any minimum guaranteed amount to be paid to our partners. In addition, we have the non-exclusive right to sell all items typically sold in a college bookstore both in-store and online. We also have the ability to integrate the store's systems with the university’s systems in order to accept student financial aid, university debit cards and other forms of payment. Our decentralized management structure empowers local teams to make decisions based on the local campus needs and fosters collaborative working relationships with our partners.

Index to Form 10-K Index to FS

We also offer “Custom Store Solutions” where an institution has a physical on-campus store for general merchandise sales, but course materials are offered virtually and fulfilled direct-to-student (either to an individual address or a central campus pick-up point). Our virtual-only solutions, discussed below, also have the ability to offer ship-to-campus options. 
The physical bookstore management contracts with colleges and universities typically include five year terms with renewal options and are typically cancelable by either party without penalty with 90 to 120 days' notice. Our campus bookstores have an average relationship tenure of 15 years. From Fiscal 2016 through Fiscal 2019, over 90% of these contracts were renewed or extended, often before their termination dates. 
Virtual Campus Bookstore Solutions
We operate 676 virtual campus bookstores. Our virtual bookstores operate under a contract with the school as the exclusive online seller of course materials. We operate as the institution’s official source of course materials with exclusive rights to booklists and access to online programs that link course materials to the courses offered by the school. Our virtual-only solutions typically ship course materials directly to students, but also have the ability to offer ship-to-campus options. 
Virtual bookstore agreements typically have a term that ranges between three to five years, with automatic renewal periods. For the past three years, we have retained over 90% of our contracts annually, with the majority of the contracts being automatically renewed as per the contract terms or renewed before their expiration dates. We pay the school a percentage of sales for the right to be the official college or university bookstore. 
We also operate Textbooks.comSM which is one of the largest e-commerce sites for new and used textbooks. This division is primarily for direct-to-student sales. 
Customers and Distribution Network
 As of April 27, 2019, we operate 772 physical college and university bookstore operations and 676 virtual bookstore operations (451 K-12 virtual stores or 67% and 225 Higher Education virtual stores or 33%) located in the United States, in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Our Retail sales team is organized by specific territory and offer all solutions (physical, virtual or custom store solutions) to public, state, private, community college, trade and technical, for-profit, online education institutions, including K-12 locations, within their respective territories.
Product and Service Offerings
We offer a broad suite of affordable course materials, including new and used print and digital textbooks, which are available for sale or rent, at our physical and virtual bookstores, as well as directly to students through Textbooks.com, our e-commerce site for new and used textbooks. We offer a robust used textbook selection, unique guaranteed buyback program, dynamic pricing, and marketplace offerings.
We service our physical and virtual bookstores with a comprehensive e-commerce experience and a broad suite of affordable course materials. Additionally, our physical campus stores are social and academic hubs through which students can access affordable course materials, along with emblematic apparel and gifts, trade books, technology, school and dorm supplies, café offerings, convenience food and beverages, and graduation products. The majority of physical campus stores also have school-branded e-commerce sites which we operate and which offer the same products as the on campus stores. 
Product and service offerings include:

• | Course Material Sales and Rentals. Sales and rentals of course materials are a core revenue driver and our online platform and registration solutions are deeply ingrained in their partner schools’ textbook selection process. Students can access affordable course materials and affinity products, including new and used print, eTextbooks, and e-content, which are available for sale or rent. We work directly with faculty to ensure the textbooks they have chosen for their courses are available in all required formats before the start of classes. Our wholesale distribution channel enables our Retail Segment to optimize textbook sourcing so they are able to more efficiently source and distribute a comprehensive inventory of affordable course materials to customers.


• | Inclusive Access. We offer our First Day inclusive access program, in which course materials, including e-content, are offered at a reduced price through a course materials fee, and delivered to students on or before the first day of class. We have entered into several agreements with major publishers, including Cengage Learning, McGraw-Hill Education and Pearson, to provide their e-content through First Day, or directly to campus bookstores and virtual bookstores. The seamless delivery is made possible by our First Day technology and publishers' technology integrations with campus systems. These initiatives provide students, faculty and institutions greater access to more affordable course materials. In Fiscal 2019, First Day total sales increased by 92% from the prior year.


• | BNC OER+. BNC OER+, a turnkey solution for colleges and universities, offers advanced, affordable learning materials built on a high-quality foundation of OER courseware and enhanced with digital content that includes videos, activities and auto-graded practice assessments that faculty can easily customize to align with class objectives.

• | eTextbooks. We have partnered with VitalSource, a global leader in building, enhancing and delivering digital content, on our digital reading platform and a broad digital catalog.


• | General Merchandise. For our physical campus bookstores and custom store solutions, we drive general merchandise sales through both in-store and online channels and feature collegiate and athletic apparel, other custom-branded school spirit products, lifestyle products, technology products, supplies and convenience items. We continue to see significant growth in our general merchandise e-commerce sales, with year-over-year growth of 5.6% in Fiscal 2019.

We operate 99 True Spirit e-commerce websites, which are dedicated virtual stores that appeal specifically to the alumni and sports fan base. We also operate pop-up retail locations at major sporting events, such as football and basketball games, for our partner colleges and universities. The True Spirit e-commerce websites for athletic branded merchandise and the physical pop-up retail locations continue to build our partner schools’ brands through alumni and athletics, fostering school spirit and capturing the excitement of collegiate sports. We utilize event driven direct marketing strategies for events, such as tournament playoffs or homecoming events, to target an online population of students, alumni and sports fans, with emails and search engine marketing. 

• | Cafés and Convenience Stores. At our physical campus locations, we operate 88 customized cafés, featuring Starbucks Coffee®, and 13 stand-alone convenience stores, as well as diverse grab-and-go options including organic, vegan, gluten-free and ethnic fare. These offerings increase traffic and time spent in our physical stores.


• | Brand Partnerships. Through our unique relationship with students, colleges and universities, and our premier position on campus, we operate as a media channel for brands looking to target the college demographic, and derive revenue from these marketing share programs. We also focused on promoting lifestyle products to students and faculty by promoting various brands to connect on a much more personal level. We create strategic, integrated campaigns which include research, email, social media, display advertising, on-campus events, signage, and sampling. Our client list includes brands such as Chase, Target, Masterpass, GEICO, DirecTV, GrubHub, Shutterfly, The New York Times and Tom's of Maine. Revenue from these services have higher margin rates due to the relatively low incremental cost structure to provide these services.

Merchandising and Supply Chain Management
Our purchasing procedures vary based on type of bookstore (physical or virtual) and by product type (i.e. textbooks, general merchandise or trade books). 
Course Materials and Trade Books
Purchases are made at the bookstore level with strategic corporate oversight to determine purchase quantities and maintain appropriate inventory levels. After titles are adopted for an upcoming term, we determine how much inventory to purchase based on several factors, including student enrollment and the previous term’s textbook sales history. For physical campus bookstores, we use an automated sourcing system to determine if another store has the necessary new or used textbooks on hand and may transfer the inventory to the appropriate store. 
The Retail Segment fulfillment order is directed first to our wholesale business before other sources of inventory are utilized. Our wholesale business significantly increases our textbook supply at competitive prices, as well as our ability to liquidate non-returnable inventory. Our broad wholesale distribution channel and warehousing systems also drive inventory efficiencies by using real-time information regarding title availability, edition status and market prices, allowing the Retail Segment to optimize its textbook sourcing and purchasing processes.
After internal sourcing, the bookstore purchases textbooks from outside suppliers and publishers. For textbook sales and rentals, we utilize sophisticated inventory management platforms to manage pricing and inventory across all stores. Our primary suppliers of new textbooks are publishers, including Pearson Education, Cengage Learning, McGraw-Hill Education, Macmillan Learning, and John Wiley & Sons. Both unsold textbooks and trade books are generally returnable to publishers for full credit. Our primary suppliers of used textbooks are students, through returns of previously rented and purchased books. We offer a “Cash for Books” program in which students can sell their books back to the physical or virtual bookstore at the end of the semester, typically in December and May. Students typically receive 50% of the price they originally paid for the book if it has been adopted for a future class or the current wholesale price if it has not. 
The larger physical bookstores feature an expanded selection of trade books (general reading) and use the Barnes & Noble, Inc. Book Master system, a proprietary merchandising system licensed from Barnes & Noble, Inc. (“Barnes & Noble”). Merchants meet with publishers on a regular basis to identify new titles and trends to support this changing business.

General Merchandise
General merchandise vendors and product selection is driven by our central merchant organization that is responsible for curating the overall product assortment for the academic year. Benchmarks are established across school type, region and the demographics of each of our schools to allow for store level insights and customization for a product assortment that is unique to address the needs of each school that we serve. Our ability to support and promote our partner schools’ brands strengthens our relationships with the administration, faculty, alumni, fans, parents and students. 
Customer Engagement and Marketing
Campus Community
Our campus relationships and contractual agreements allow us to seamlessly integrate into the college and university community. With direct access to our customer base through both physical and digital channels, we drive awareness, revenue and loyalty for the schools that we serve. We actively market and promote to all segments of our customer base for our physical and virtual bookstores, as well as Textbooks.com. We develop fully-integrated marketing programs to drive engagement with the students, parents, alumni and fans to promote all of our product and services, with a focus on academic course material needs, as well as school spirit, supply and technology categories. Textbooks.com marketing strategies target an online population of students, lifelong learners, parents and general textbook shoppers through a variety of channels including email, search engine marketing, affiliate marketing and display marketing.
We have robust research capabilities that keep us ahead of the rapidly changing needs and behaviors of our customers, which allow us to proactively respond with relevant and dynamic solutions. Our College InsightsTM platform connects us to a community of over 8,000 students who help guide and inform our strategies and direction.
Our customizable technology delivers a seamless experience providing students and faculty with the ability to research, locate and purchase the most affordable course materials. Our platforms includes registration integration, learning management system integration, real-time financial aid platform, point of sale platform and course fee solutions. Through our fully-integrated purchasing process, students can purchase their course materials in-store, online, or when registering for classes.
Faculty and School Administrators
We support faculty and academic leadership with our proprietary online platform which allows content search, discovery and course material adoption, enabling them to offer course materials that are both relevant and affordable for their students.
Seasonality
Our retail business is highly seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the second and third fiscal quarters, when college students generally purchase and rent textbooks for the upcoming semesters. Revenue from the rental of physical textbooks is deferred and recognized over the rental period commencing at point of sale. Revenue from the rental of digital textbooks is recognized at time of sale. 
WHOLESALE SEGMENT
General
The Wholesale Segment is comprised of the wholesale operations of our MBS subsidiary, which we acquired in February 2017. The Wholesale Segment enables the Company to generate more value from the textbook marketplace through inventory and procurement synergies. 
We are one of the largest textbook wholesalers in the country, providing a comprehensive selection of new and used textbooks at a lower cost of supply to approximately 3,500 physical bookstores, including our Retail Segment's 772 physical campus bookstores. Our wholesale business also sources and distributes new and used textbooks to our 676 virtual bookstores. Additionally, through our Wholesale Segment, we sell hardware and a software suite of applications that provides inventory management and point-of-sale solutions to approximately 400 college bookstores. 
Product and Service Offerings
Product and Service offerings include:

• | Wholesale Textbook Distribution. Our large inventory of used textbooks consists of approximately 300,000 textbook titles in stock, and utilizes a highly automated distribution facility that processes more than 11 million textbooks annually.

Additionally, we are a national distributor for rental textbooks offered through McGraw-Hill Education's consignment rental program (which includes approximately 384 titles) and Pearson Education’s consignment rental program (which includes approximately 328 titles). Through our centrally located, advanced distribution center, we offer the seamless integration of these consignment rental programs and centralized administration and distribution to 1,663 stores, including the Retail Segment 
9

Index to Form 10-K Index to FS

stores. These consignment rental programs are available to our wholesale customers, including institutionally run and contract managed campus bookstores, as well as our physical and virtual bookstores.

• | Wholesale Inventory Management, Hardware and POS Software. We sell hardware and a software suite of applications that provides inventory management and point-of-sale solutions to approximately 400 college bookstores. We provide on-site installation for point-of-sale terminals and servers, and offer technical assistance through user training and our support center facility. The cost savings and ease of deployment ensure clients get the most out of their management systems and create strong customer loyalty.

Supply Chain Management
An extensive national sales force secures a steady supply of high demand used textbooks, which is critical to the success of the wholesale business. A primary supplier of used textbooks are students, through the return of previously rented and purchased books to their campus bookstore. We purchase new and used textbooks from our physical and virtual bookstores, other bookstore operators, institutional bookstores, book dealers, publishers, other distributors and other wholesalers. We offer a “Cash for Books” program in which students can sell their books back to the store at the end of the semester, typically in December and May.
Our broad wholesale distribution channel and warehousing systems also drives inventory efficiencies, allowing us to optimize our textbook sourcing, purchasing and liquidation processes. We leverage our wholesale distribution channel and warehousing systems to more efficiently source and distribute a robust, comprehensive inventory of affordable course materials to our bookstore customers. Through our proprietary Database Buying Guide, we have access to the best maintained, most accurate, and most complete source of college textbook information available - a key asset that allows us to develop superior supply and demand insights and risk management capabilities.
Customer Marketing Strategies
We have developed deep relationships with our wholesale customer base as a result of our substantial inventory of used textbooks, a comprehensive catalog of textbooks, and superior service and systems support. We continue to maintain a portfolio of profitable accounts, given the demand for used and new textbooks has historically been greater than the available supply. 
Seasonality
Our wholesale business is highly seasonal, as a major portion of sales and operating profit is realized during the first, second and third fiscal quarters, when textbooks are sold for retail distribution.
DIGITAL STUDENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT
General 
The Digital Student Solutions (“DSS”) Segment includes direct-to-student product and service offerings to assist students to study more effectively and improve academic performance, thus enabling them to gain the valuable skills necessary to succeed after college. DSS is comprised of the operations of Student Brands, LLC, a leading direct-to-student subscription-based writing services business, and bartleby, a direct-to-student subscription-based offering providing textbook solutions, expert questions and answers, tutoring and test prep services. 
We offer these online solutions to students via internet search engine optimization, as well as by marketing directly to students in our physical and virtual bookstore footprint and nationally to students. Our physical and virtual bookstore footprint, and associated student relationships, present a sizable addressable market for our digital products and services. We continue to enhance and invest in our digital content and solutions to complement and leverage our bookstore and wholesale businesses. The revenue from these services have higher margin rates due to the relatively fixed cost structure of these operations.
We continue to aggressively expand our ecosystem of products and services through our own internal development, as well as by partnering with other companies to provide a complete hub of products and services designed to improve student success and outcomes. We continue to innovate and collaborate with our partners to provide solutions and services in an efficient, low-cost/high-value manner that extend well beyond sourcing course materials and sales to include new digital services that support successful student outcomes. We leverage our product offerings by bundling our products with complementary solution services. 
During Fiscal 2019, we invested in our student success platform and proprietary content to drive our ecosystem of products and services.  In the future, our strategy is to aggressively grow the DSS Segment through: (i) internally developed new products and services; (ii) acquisitions of companies, products and services; (iii) and partnering with other leading service providers, like The Princeton Review. Unlike other providers of digital services to students, our well-established, deep relationships with college and university partners, as well as our physical presence on campus, provides us with a significant competitive advantage as we roll out new products and services on the campuses and universities we serve. This integration with the products and services from our other operating segments allows us to offer students new products and services in an increasingly relevant, cost effective, and 
10

Index to Form 10-K Index to FS

targeted way.  The addressable market outside our physical and virtual bookstore footprint is an additional area where we market these products and services to students.
Customers and Service Offerings
Student Brands
Student Brands provides writing services in a direct-to-student subscription-based model. The majority of subscriptions sold are one month in duration. Subscription revenue is deferred and recognized over the service period. Student Brands also generates revenue from digital advertisements. The revenue from these services have higher margin rates due to the relatively fixed cost structure of these operations. 
In August 2018, we further expanded Student Brands' writing services via acquisition of PaperRater, a leading website that offers students a suite of writing services aimed at improving multiple facets of writing. PaperRater's services include plagiarism detection, grammar feedback, and an AI-based writing score predictor, and are highly complementary to Student Brands' existing writing service offerings. 
Student Brands has a substantial and growing community of online learners, with approximately 100,000 subscribers across its digital properties, which include bartleby.com, 123HelpMe.com, PaperRater.com and StudyMode.com in the United States and TrabalhosFeitos.com, Etudier.com and Monografias.com in Brazil, France and Mexico, respectively. 
Student Brands addresses writing pain points; students can search for a topic, develop an outline, and access authenticity technology. The content database allows students to leverage academic resources and references, with over 42 million essays across 4 languages representing more than 15 different countries, and receives more than 27.5 million unique monthly visitors to its sites. Student Brands utilizes deep data analytics and artificial intelligence to drive its content management system, the “Content Brain”. The study tools supplement the student’s learning ecosystem by assisting across multiple subjects and varied assignments on a digital platform.
bartleby
In Fiscal 2019, we launched bartleby textbook solutions and a question and answer feature, our first internally developed products, on bartleby.com, providing critical services for students to achieve better success throughout their academic journey. Bartleby is a central offering in our developing ecosystem of direct-to-student digital products and services, accessible anytime and anywhere. The bartleby product offerings consist of bartleby learn™ comprised of textbook solutions (over 900 titles), question and answer solutions, and study guides; bartleby write™ comprised of revision, plagiarism, citation and scoring tools; and bartleby tutor™ (beginning in the upcoming Fall semester) comprised of online tutoring services.
We offer these online solutions to students via internet search engine optimization, as well as by marketing directly to students in our physical and virtual bookstore footprint and nationally to students. We provide these services in a direct-to-student subscription-based model. The majority of subscriptions sold are one month in duration. Subscription revenue is deferred and recognized over the service period. 
Customer Marketing Strategies
The implementation of our digital strategy initially relies on leveraging our bookstore relationships, both physical and virtual, to help accelerate the adoption of our new digital products and services. By leveraging the our physical and virtual bookstore footprints among students and faculty of both K-12 schools and higher education institutions, as well with our search engine optimization efforts, we have substantially more opportunities to market the solutions students need to improve success in the classroom and beyond. We have demonstrated positive leverage of our managed bookstore footprint, with subscriber results that exceeded our expectations. Since launch during the Spring semester of Fiscal 2019, we have achieved over 50,000 customers subscribed for bartleby textbook solutions utilizing marketing and promotional offers, both within our managed bookstore footprint and nationally to students, representing a small percentage of the total addressable market opportunity. 
Seasonality
Revenues and operating profit are realized relatively consistently throughout the year, although quarterly results may fluctuate depending on the timing of the start of the various schools' semesters.

COMPETITION
We operate within a competitive and rapidly changing business environment, in general, and each of our lines of business face competition for the products and services they offer. As it relates to our full service campus bookstore operations, Follett is the primary competitor for institutional contracts. We also compete with other vendors for smaller accounts, including BBA Solutions, Texas Book Company, indiCo and Tree of Life. Our online/virtual course material store operations primarily face competition from eCampus and Akademos, and on occasion, Ambassador Educational Solutions. We also face competition from direct-to-student course material channels, including Amazon, Chegg.com, publishers (e.g. Cengage Learning, Pearson Education and McGraw-Hill Education) that bypass the retail distribution channel by selling directly to students and institutions and other third-party websites and/or local bookstores. We face competition from eTextbook/digital content providers VitalSource Technologies, Inc. and Red Shelf, which offer independent bookstores a catalog of digital content and distribution services and also have direct-to-student selling channels for digital materials. 
Competitors for institutional contracts for our general merchandise and spirit wear offerings include Fanatics, indiCo, Sodexo and Aramark. Our general merchandise business also faces competition from direct-to-student sales from Fanatics, Walmart, Amazon, Dick’s Sporting Goods, other third-party online retailers, physical and online office supply stores and local and national retailers that offer college-themed and other general merchandise. 
Competitors for our wholesale new and used textbook inventory and distribution include Amazon, BBA Solutions, indiCo, Nebraska Book Company and Texas Book Company. 
Our DSS Segment faces competition from other digital student solutions providers including Chegg.com, CourseHero, Grammarly, Quizlet, Noodle Tools, and Turnitin (iParadigms).  As we develop a wider range of products and services, our competitive landscape will change and include other competitors in the broader student services market.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and in the education industry, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. The manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the Internet and students in general and how they will relate to our business in particular, are often unclear. For example, we often cannot be certain how existing laws will apply in the e-commerce and online context, including with respect to such topics as privacy, defamation, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, sweepstakes, promotions, content regulation, financial aid, scholarships, student matriculation and recruitment, quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
Numerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States, and in some cases internationally, that have a direct impact on our business and operations. For example:
The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws adopted by a number of states, regulate unsolicited commercial emails, create criminal penalties for emails containing fraudulent headers and control other abusive online marketing practices. Similarly, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has guidelines that impose responsibilities on us with respect to communications with consumers and impose fines and liability for failure to comply with rules with respect to advertising or marketing practices they may deem misleading or deceptive.
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”) restricts telemarketing and the use of automated telephone equipment. The TCPA limits the use of automatic dialing systems, artificial or prerecorded voice messages, SMS text messages and fax machines. It also applies to unsolicited text messages advertising the commercial availability of goods or services. Additionally, a number of states have enacted statutes that address telemarketing. For example, some states, such as California, Illinois and New York, have created do-not-call lists. Other states, such as Oregon and Washington, have enacted “no rebuttal statutes” that require the telemarketer to end the call when the consumer indicates that he or she is not interested in the product being sold. Restrictions on telephone marketing, including calls and text messages, are enforced by the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, states and through the availability of statutory damages and class action lawsuits for violations of the TCPA. 
The Restore Online Shopper Confidence Act (“ROSCA”), and similar state laws, impose requirements and restrictions on online services that automatically charge payment cards on a periodic basis to renew a subscription service, if the consumer does not cancel the service.
The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, or CARD Act, and similar laws and regulations adopted by a number of states regulate credit card and gift certificate use, including expiration dates and fees. Our business also requires that we comply with payment card industry data security and other standards. In particular, we are subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs,

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which will go into effect on January 1, 2020, provides consumers the right to know what personal data companies collect, how it is used, and the right to access, delete and opt out of sale of their personal information to third parties. It also expands the definition of personal information and gives consumers increased privacy rights and protections for that information.
