Industry Overview
At the highest level, semiconductors can be classified either as discrete devices, such as individual transistors, or integrated circuits, where a number of transistors and other components are combined to form a more complicated electronic subsystem. ICs can be divided into three primary categories: digital, analog, and mixed-signal. Digital ICs, such as memory devices and microprocessors, can store or perform arithmetic functions with data. Analog ICs, by contrast, handle real-world signals such as temperature, pressure, light, sound or speed, and also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices. Mixed-signal ICs combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real-world inputs into the digital domain.
Historically, growth in the semiconductor industry has been driven by content expansion in computing, mobile and consumer electronics. However, research analysts anticipate that as each of these markets approaches saturation, the automotive sector will become one of the fastest growing opportunities. Specifically, according to IHS, the global automotive semiconductor market, which was valued at $54 billion in 2021, is projected to reach $130 billion by 2028, registering a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) over this period of 13%.
indie’s Market Opportunity
In today’s automobiles, semiconductors perform a variety of functions across multiple electronic components and systems, including sensing, processing data, storing information and converting or controlling signals. Semiconductor architectures vary significantly depending upon the specific function or application of the end product. They also differ based on a number of technical characteristics, including the degree of integration, level of customization, programmability and the underlying process technology utilized in manufacturing and assembly.
While semiconductors have always comprised the core building blocks of automotive electronic systems and equipment, recent technological advances have substantially increased their features, functionality and performance. Today, they support enhanced user interfaces and offer improved power consumption — all with reduced footprints and lower costs. These innovations have resulted in significant growth opportunities spanning diverse end markets and applications.
The three megatrends driving the automotive semiconductor market are catalyzed by: (i) the increasing electrification of vehicle drivetrains leading to the rapid proliferation of electric vehicles (“EVs”); (ii) the adoption of advanced driver assistance systems (“ADAS”) and driving automation functionality to improve road safety and strive towards higher levels of vehicle automation; and (iii) consumer demands for engaging, connected and convenient in-cabin user experience (UX).
Regarding electrification, S&P Global Mobility forecasts a 32% EV CAGR, with total annual EV production growing from 5 million in 2021, to 35 million in 2028, representing greater than one-third of all new light vehicle production. These forecast volumes are driven in part by increasing global governmental mandates to decarbonize road transportation which contributes around 16% of total greenhouse gases (“GHG”) according to the International Energy Agency, but also by improved consumer awareness and preference for low carbon vehicle options. While the state of California has been a global leader in this through its Low-Emission Vehicle (“LEV”), GHG and Zero-Emission Vehicle (“ZEV”) regulations and criteria, there is accelerating international momentum to address the climate change impact of vehicles through global forums such as the United Nations Conference of the Parties (“COP”). At COP26 in 2021, a combination of more than 100 countries, cities, states, vehicle manufacturers - including BYD Auto, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo Cars - and other key institutional stakeholders signed the Glasgow Declaration on Zero-Emission Cars and Vans to end the sale of internal combustion engines by 2035 in leading markets, and by 2040 worldwide. These collective initiatives, commitments and regulations – enabled by semiconductor technologies - will drive global EV uptake, reduce harmful emissions and benefit society as a whole. According to IHS, the semiconductor value to support this global drivetrain electrification will grow at a 26% CAGR, from $6.1 billion in 2021, to $30.3 billion in 2028.
In parallel to the rapid electrification of vehicles, global ADAS system deployments are expected to increase substantially, driven in part by mandates for increased vehicle safety features by governmental bodies such as the European Commission and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) in the United States. Better consumer safety awareness and demand created by safety assessment initiatives such as the European and U.S. New Car Assessment Programs (“NCAP”) have also directly influenced vehicle OEMs to incorporate minimum levels of crash safety and mitigation into new vehicles since 1979, and have evolved over time to include sophisticated semiconductor-enabled ADAS and automation capabilities such as Automatic Electronic Braking (“AEB”), Lane Keeping Assist (“LKA”), speed assistance and forward collision warning and, most recently, driver- and occupant monitoring (“DMS”, “OMS”), in order for a vehicle to be awarded a 5-star rating. With these global safety rating programs and governmental regulation, auto manufacturers are delivering more safety features to customers, the ADAS ECU market size will grow from $21 billion in 2021 to reach $50 billion by 2028, with corresponding semiconductor content of $8 billion to $31 billion, respectively, or a 21% CAGR, according to S&P Global.
In addition to electrified vehicle drivetrains and new safety features driving semiconductor content value in vehicles is the demand for improved in-cabin UX. In-cabin UX used to be synonymous with the in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) system, but today UX is defined by much more than IVI; consumers want intuitive, informative, connected and engaging interactions with their vehicle as they have become accustomed to with their portable consumer devices, but they also want enhanced convenience, utility, comfort and customizability of the cabin to their personal preferences, the nature of the journey or even the driver’s mood. Interior lighting, device power delivery, wireless charging, device-to-IVI interfacing, connected car networking and a multitude of utility and comfort functions enabled by small motors (such as electric seats, seat ventilation, air-conditioning vents, etc.) contribute to the wider in-cabin UX, and all require semiconductor-enabled electronics. S&P Global forecasts that the semiconductor content value for in-cabin UX, which includes IVI, connectivity and body and convenience functions, will reach $45 billion in 2028, representing a 10% CAGR from $23 billion in 2021.
indie’s addressable market is not solely dependent on global automotive vehicle volumes, but rather on the increased levels of semiconductor content that are required in vehicles to support the safety and automation systems, enhanced user experiences and electrification applications as introduced above.

Intellectual Property
The core strengths of our business are our intellectual property portfolio and engineering experience, both of which guide product development activities and our approach to patent filings.
Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies. In general, we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable. We have a number of core technology patents currently in process, including provisions, but we do not rely on any particular patent or patents for our success and have instead relied on our know-how and trade secrets. We also rely on a combination of non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty, to protect our technology and processes.
The semiconductor industry in general is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Patent infringement is an ongoing risk, in part because other companies in our industry could 
have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims.
Competition
The market for high-performance analog, digital and mixed-signal semiconductors for automotive applications, is competitive although recent consolidation across the semiconductor industry has reduced the number of viable competitors and created design opportunities for us. Our primary competitors are other automotive-focused semiconductor companies, including Infineon, Monolithic Power Systems, NXP, Renesas and ST Microelectronics.
Some competitors have more financial resources than we do, while others have a more diversified set of products and end markets. Accordingly, such competitors may be able to respond more quickly to customer requests and market developments, and to better withstand external economic or market factors.
However, we believe that our technical and design experience, our existing approved vendor list position across multiple Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and a growing demand for software-embedded solutions with proprietary manufacturing and packaging capabilities, position us to outpace our addressable market.
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
We believe responsible and sustainable business practices support our long-term success. As a company, we are committed to protecting and supporting our people, our environment, and our communities.
