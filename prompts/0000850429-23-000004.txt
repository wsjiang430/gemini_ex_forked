1. The Company uses net sales from continuing operations as its measure of revenues from external customers at the segment level. For more business segment information, see Note 13 “Business Segments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15. 

In 2022, 2021 and 2020, Aluminum Extrusions net sales accounted for approximately 71%, 67% and 63% of Tredegar’s consolidated net sales, respectively.
Open Orders. Overall open orders in Aluminum Extrusions was approximately $136.0 million, or 41 million pounds, at December 31, 2022 compared to approximately $306.4 million, or 97 million pounds, at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $170.4 million, or approximately 56%. The reduction in open orders in 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily due to order cancellations as customers report high inventory levels. During the second half of 2022, the Company has observed order cancellations as customers report high inventory levels. Aluminum Extrusions expects the confluence of orders, cancellations and shipments to drive open orders to pre-COVID-19, normalized levels during the first half of 2023. The outlook for demand and shipments in 2023 remains uncertain given recessionary concerns. Sales volume for Aluminum Extrusions, which the Company believes is cyclical and seasonal in nature due to its end-use markets, was 174.7 million pounds in 2022, 183.4 million pounds in 2021 and 186.4 million pounds in 2020. 
Raw Materials. The primary raw materials used by Aluminum Extrusions consist of aluminum ingot, aluminum scrap and various alloys, which are purchased from domestic and foreign producers in open-market purchases and under annual contracts. Refer to Item 7a. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of this Form 10-K (“Item 7a”) for additional information on aluminum price trends. Aluminum Extrusions believes that it has adequate supply agreements for aluminum raw materials in 2023 despite continued supply chain cost increases related to paint, chemicals, packaging and other non-aluminum raw materials.

General
Intellectual Property. Tredegar considers patents, licenses and trademarks to be material to PE Films. On December 31, 2022, PE Films held 43 patents (including 6 U.S. patents), and 76 registered trademarks (including 4 U.S. registered trademarks). Flexible Packaging Films held 1 U.S. patent and 17 registered trademarks (including 4 U.S. registered trademarks). Aluminum Extrusions held no U.S. patents and 3 U.S. registered trademarks. As of December 31, 2022, these patents had remaining terms of 1.5 to 17 years. 
Government Regulation. The Company’s operations are subject to various local, state, federal and foreign government regulations, including environmental, privacy and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations.
U.S. laws concerning the environment to which the Company’s domestic operations are or may be subject to include the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), regulations promulgated under these acts, and other federal, state or local laws or regulations governing environmental matters. Compliance with these laws is an important consideration because Tredegar uses hazardous materials in some of its operations, is a generator of hazardous waste, and wastewater from the Company’s operations is discharged to various types of wastewater management systems. Under CERCLA and other laws, Tredegar may be subject to financial exposure for costs associated with waste management and disposal, even if the Company fully complies with applicable environmental laws.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act relating to emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (“GHG”), including mandatory reporting and permitting requirements. Several of the Company’s manufacturing operations result in emissions of carbon dioxide or GHG and are subject to the current GHG regulations. The Company’s compliance with environmental regulations has yet to require significant capital expenditures; however, environmental standards tend to become more stringent over time. Therefore, in order to comply with current or future environmental legislation or regulations, the Company may be subject to additional capital expenditures, operating expenses or other compliance costs, the amounts and timing of which are not presently determinable but which could be significant, including constructing new facilities or modifying existing facilities.
Like environmental regulations, current or future privacy and anti-corruption and anti-bribery legislation or regulations may subject the Company to additional capital expenditures, operating expenses or other compliance costs, the amounts and timing of which are not presently determinable but could be significant. Any failure to comply with current or future laws and regulations, including environmental, privacy and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, could subject Tredegar 
to substantial penalties, fines, costs and expenses. For further discussion regarding certain environmental, privacy and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations to which the Company is subject, see Item 1A below.
Human Capital Management. 
Overview
Tredegar employed approximately 2,300 people at December 31, 2022 located in the U.S., Brazil, and Asia, of which 80% are located in the U.S. Approximately 18% of the Company’s employees are represented by labor unions located in the U.S. under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates, none of which expire before 2025. All of Tredegar’s Brazilian employees are represented by a national labor union. Generally, the total number of employees of Tredegar does not significantly fluctuate throughout the year. However, acquisition or divestiture activity, or changes in the level of business activity may impact employee levels. 
Health and Safety
Tredegar has continuously exceeded the industry standards for safety. The Company uses various forms of employee safety metrics to assess the health and safety performance of its Aluminum Extrusions, PE Films and Flexible Packaging operations, including employee safety data which is available on the Company’s website at https://tredegar.com/about-tredegar/our-broader-commitments/committed-to-our-employees/. 
Additionally, Aluminum Extrusions has on-site health clinics at its Carthage and Clearfield facilities. These clinics allow Aluminum Extrusions to invest in its people, provide more personal and more thorough healthcare to employees, and enhance the employer-employee relationship. The Carthage and Clearfield clinics serve over 500 and 300 employees, respectively. 
Talent and Development
The Company believes its employees are its most valuable asset and are critical to the success of the Company. The Company seeks to retain employees by offering competitive wages, benefits and training opportunities. To assess and monitor employee retention and engagement, the Company surveys employees and takes actions to address areas of employee concern. The annual employee engagement survey results are presented to Tredegar’s Board of Directors (“Board”). Additionally, the objectives of our executive compensation programs are to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified executive officers. To accomplish these objectives, the Company relies on a pay strategy that emphasizes performance-based compensation through annual and long-term incentives. The Company believes that this pay strategy creates a strong link between pay and performance and aligns with our business strategy of generating strong operating results and shareholder value creation while controlling fixed costs. 
The Company is committed to holistically supporting our employees both at work and in their communities by:
•Strictly following all applicable health, safety and non-discrimination laws in each country;
•Promoting the highest standards for employee health and safety through innovative programs; and 
•Providing opportunities for community outreach and supporting programs that enhance the lives of children and families.
Inclusion and Diversity
Tredegar strictly complies with all applicable state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location where Tredegar and its businesses have facilities to ensure healthy and positive working conditions. This applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruiting, hiring, job assignments, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their race, creed, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, pregnancy, national origin, ethnicity, political affiliation, union membership, marital status, citizenship status, veteran status, disability or other protected category. Employees who experience or witness discriminatory behavior are encouraged to report such behavior to their supervisor, Human Resources or Tredegar’s toll-free anonymous reporting hotline. Additionally, the Company spends significant resources in developing its employees. Among the five core principles of the “The Tredegar Way” that the Company uses to guide its organization, the “Leadership” principle is focused on building a team of motivated and engaged leaders at every level of the Company. Each business unit has identified specific action plans to promote the Leadership principle among its employees. Action plans include talent development, skills training, reinforcement of strong cultural values, and robust systems to ensure a safe working environment.
