Item 1. Business 
 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, (i) MBIA, the Company, we, our and us refer to MBIA Inc., a Connecticut corporation incorporated in 1986, together with its subsidiaries, and (ii) unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to MBIA Corp. are (i) for any references relating to the period ended January 10, 2017, to MBIA Insurance Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, MBIA UK Insurance Limited (MBIA UK), and MBIA Mexico S.A. de C.V (MBIA Mexico) and (ii) for any references relating to the period after January 10, 2017, to MBIA Insurance Corporation together with MBIA Mexico. 
 OVERVIEW 
 The Companys primary objectives are ensuring that adequate liquidity exists at MBIA Inc. to satisfy all of its outstanding obligations, mitigating losses at National and MBIA Corp., including Nationals exposures to insured debt obligations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain of its instrumentalities (Puerto Rico), as described further herein, and maximizing recoveries on paid insurance claims. The Company may also pursue strategic alternatives that could enhance shareholder value. 
 MBIAs primary business has been to provide financial guarantee insurance to the United States public finance markets through our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation (National). Nationals financial guarantee insurance policies provide investors with unconditional and irrevocable guarantees of the payment of the principal, interest or other amounts owing on insured obligations when due. National has ceased pursuing the writing of new financial guarantee policies, and its primary activity today is to provide ongoing surveillance of its existing insured portfolio of $57.9 billion gross par outstanding as of December 31, 2018. 
 MBIA has also provided financial guarantee insurance in the international and structured finance markets through its subsidiary MBIA Corp. As of December 31, 2018, MBIA Corp.s total insured gross par outstanding was $11.9 billion. Effective on January 10, 2017, MBIA Corp.s wholly-owned subsidiary, MBIA UK (Holdings) Limited (MBIA UK Holdings), the parent company to MBIA UK, sold MBIA UK, to Assured Guaranty Corp. (Assured), a subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. We do not expect MBIA Corp. to write any significant new policies in the foreseeable future. Given MBIA Corp.s capital structure and business prospects, we do not expect its financial performance to have a material impact on MBIA Inc. Refer to Results of OperationsCapital Resources in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of MBIA Corp.s insurance statutory capital. 
 MBIA Services Corporation (MBIA Services), also owned by MBIA Inc., is a service company which provides support services such as surveillance, risk management, legal, accounting, treasury and information technology, among others, to our businesses on a fee-for-service basis. 
 MBIA Inc. Capital Management 
 The Company manages its capital and liquidity in order to ensure that it can service its debt and other financial obligations and pay its operating expenses while maintaining an adequate cushion against potential adverse events. MBIA Inc. has consistently received dividends from National and releases from the tax escrow account over the past several years and currently maintains a stable liquidity position which is expected to allow it to service its obligations over the next several years without needing to access the capital markets. Our capital management strategies include enhancing shareholder value by (i) having the Company or National repurchase outstanding MBIA Inc. common shares when management deems such actions are appropriate, taking into account the price of the stock, anticipated liquidity needs, and other relevant factors and (ii) retiring our unsecured and MBIA Global Funding, LLC (GFL) debt through calls and repurchases at prices that create economic benefit to the Company.

 Item 1. Business (continued) 
 
During 2018, the Company and National collectively repurchased 5.8 million shares at a cost of $48 million under the repurchase authorization approved by the Board in November of 2017. During 2017, the Company and National collectively repurchased 43 million shares at a cost of $325 million under repurchase authorizations approved by the Board in February of 2016 and June of 2017. During 2016, the Company and National collectively repurchased 16.6 million shares at a cost of $105 million under repurchase authorizations approved by the Board in October of 2015 and February of 2016. At each time of repurchase, management and the Board viewed such use of available capital as the best alternative for capital management. 
 Unsecured debt includes MBIA Inc.s senior notes and medium-term notes (MTNs) issued by its subsidiary, GFL. During 2018, the Company repurchased $78 million and paid $17 million par value related to GFL debt maturities. During 2017, the Company repurchased $160 million and paid $38 million par value related to GFL debt maturities. 
 In each of the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, National declared and paid dividends of $108 million and $118 million, respectively, to its ultimate parent, MBIA Inc. In addition, during the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, MBIA Inc. received $56 million and $18 million, respectively, in cash from an escrow account held by MBIA Inc. under the MBIA groups tax sharing agreement as described further under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidityCorporate Liquidity in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. In addition, in 2018, $90 million was returned to National as a result of its 2017 financial results. 
 National Risk Mitigation 
 Nationals most significant risk is credit risk in its large and diverse insured portfolio of domestic public finance credits. Nationals risk mitigation strategy is premised on proactive portfolio management, including surveillance of financial performance and covenant compliance, the exercise of creditor rights, remediation and  in select cases  workouts of distressed credits. Nationals approach generally focuses on the early detection of stress and proactive intervention, though its rights and its ability to take certain actions on a particular credit will always be case-specific. As part of its remediation efforts, National may elect to facilitate and participate in refinancings of existing credit exposures where the new transaction will have the anticipated effect of improving the issuers ability to service its debt and strengthen Nationals legal security or covenant package. National may also seek to purchase its own insured obligations as part of an overall risk mitigation strategy, subject to internal and regulatory limitations. 
 Presently, the most distressed credits in Nationals portfolio are obligations issued by Puerto Rico. As described further herein, four of these credits, the Commonwealths General Obligation Bonds, the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (COFINA), the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority (PRHTA) and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) have been placed into bankruptcy-like processes under Title III of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA). For additional information relating to the risks arising from Nationals Puerto Rico exposures, refer to the Insured Portfolio Loss Related Risk Factors section in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.MBIA Corp. Risk Mitigation 
 MBIA Corp. has not written a meaningful amount of new business since 2008 as a result of declining financial capacity, ratings downgrades and regulatory limitations placed on its business. Since that time it has experienced considerable stress as a result of unprecedented levels of loss in its structured finance insurance business, primarily in its residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) pools, and collateralized debt obligation (CDO) portfolios. As a result, since 2008, MBIA Corp.s strategy has focused primarily on recovering losses on insured transactions, reducing future expected economic losses in the insured portfolio through commutations and other risk mitigation strategies, and managing liquidity. Refer to Note 6: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding loss reserves and recoveries.

 Item 1. Business (continued) 
 
Our liquidity and capital forecasts, and projected collections of recoveries, for MBIA Corp., reflect resources that we expect to be adequate to pay expected insurance claims. However, there can be no assurance that MBIA Corp. will realize its expected recoveries in full or on its projected timeframe. Refer to Risk Factors-MBIA Corp. Risk Factors-Continuing elevated loss payments and delay or failure in realizing expected recoveries on insured transactions may materially and adversely affect MBIA Insurance Corporations statutory capital and its ability to meet liquidity needs and could cause the New York State Department of Financial Services (the NYSDFS) to put MBIA Insurance Corporation into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding if the NYSDFS concludes that MBIA Insurance Corporation will not be able to pay expected insurance claims, in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Given the separation of MBIA Inc. and MBIA Corp. as distinct legal entities, the absence of any cross defaults between the entities, and the lack of reliance by MBIA Inc. on MBIA Corp. for the receipt of dividends, we do not believe that a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding of MBIA Insurance Corporation by the NYSDFS would have any significant long-term liquidity impact on MBIA Inc. 
 OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS 
 Our U.S. public finance insurance portfolio is managed through National, and our international and structured finance insurance portfolios are managed through MBIA Corp. We do not expect National or MBIA Corp. to write new business for the foreseeable future. 
 We have been compensated for our insurance policies by insurance premiums that were paid upfront or on an installment basis. Our financial guarantee insurance was offered in both the new issue and secondary markets. In addition, we have provided financial guarantees or sureties to debt service reserve funds. The primary risk in our insurance operations is that of adverse credit performance in the insured portfolio. When writing new business we sought to maintain a diversified insured portfolio and have insured transactions with the aim of managing and diversifying risk based on a variety of criteria including revenue source, issue size, type of asset, industry concentrations, type of bond and geographic location. Despite this objective, there can be no assurance that we will avoid losses on multiple credits as a result of a single event or series of events. 
 Because we generally guarantee to the holder of an insured obligation the timely payment of amounts due on the obligation in accordance with its original payment schedule, in the case of a default or other triggering event, payments under the insurance policy generally cannot be accelerated against us unless we consent to the acceleration. In the event of a default, however, we may have the right, in our sole discretion, to accelerate the obligations and pay them in full. Otherwise, we are required to pay principal, interest or other amounts only as scheduled payments come due, even if the holders are permitted by the terms of the insured obligations to have the full amount of principal, accrued interest or other amounts due, declared due and payable immediately in the event of a default. 
 Our payment obligations after a default vary by deal and by insurance type. Our public finance insurance generally insures scheduled interest and principal. Our structured finance policies generally insure (i) timely interest and ultimate principal; (ii) ultimate principal only at final maturity; or, (iii) payments upon settlement of individual collateral losses as they occur after any deductible or subordination has been exhausted. With respect to the insurance of certain derivative transactions, including credit default swap (CDS) contracts written in the international and structured finance insurance segment, in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of certain insolvency or payment defaults under the CDS contracts, the CDS contracts may be subject to termination by the counterparty, triggering a claim for the fair value of the contract. Our U.S. public finance segment did not write insurance in CDS form and therefore its policies do not feature this potential trigger. 
 In the event of a default in the payment of principal, interest or other insured amounts by an issuer, the insurance company will make funds available in the insured amount generally within one to three business days following notification. Longer timeframes may apply for international transactions. Generally, our insurance companies provide for this payment upon receipt of proof of ownership of the obligations due, as well as upon receipt of instruments appointing the insurer as agent for the holders and evidencing the assignment of the rights of the holders with respect to the payments made by the insurer or other appropriate documentation.

 Item 1. Business (continued) 
National Insured Portfolio 
 Nationals insured portfolio consists of municipal bonds, including tax-exempt and taxable indebtedness of U.S. political subdivisions and territories, as well as utilities, airports, health care institutions, higher educational facilities, student loan issuers, housing authorities and other similar agencies and obligations issued by private entities that finance projects that serve a substantial public purpose. Municipal bonds and privately issued bonds used for the financing of public purpose projects are generally supported by taxes, assessments, user fees or tariffs related to the use of these projects, lease payments or other similar types of revenue streams. 
 As of December 31, 2018, National had $57.9 billion of insured gross par outstanding on U.S. public finance obligations covering 3,662 policies and diversified among 2,105 credits, which we define as any group of issues supported by the same revenue source. Insurance in force, which includes all insured debt service, as of December 31, 2018 was $111.5 billion. 
 All of the policies were underwritten on the assumption that the insurance will remain in force until maturity or early retirement of the insured obligations. National estimates that the average life of its domestic public finance insurance policies in force as of December 31, 2018 was 10 years. The average life was determined by applying a weighted average calculation, using the remaining years to contractual maturity and weighting them on the basis of the remaining debt service insured. No assumptions were made for any future refundings, early redemptions or terminations of insured issues. Average annual insured debt service on the portfolio as of December 31, 2018 was $6.7 billion. 
 Nationals underwriting guidelines limited the insurance in force for any one insured credit, and for other categories such as geography. In addition, National is subject to regulatory single-risk limits with respect to any insured bond issue. See the Insurance Regulation section below for a description of these regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2018, Nationals gross par amount outstanding for its ten largest insured U.S. public finance credits totaled $10.1 billion, representing 17.4% of Nationals total U.S. public finance gross par amount outstanding. Refer to Note 13: Insurance in Force in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Companys insured portfolio. 
 MBIA Corp. Insured Portfolio 
 MBIA Corp.s insured portfolio consists of policies that insure various types of international public finance and global structured finance obligations that were sold in the new issue and secondary markets or are referenced in CDS contracts. International public finance obligations include bonds and loans extended to entities located outside of the U.S., including utilities, infrastructure projects and sovereign-related and sub-sovereign issuers, such as regions, authorities or their equivalent as well as sovereign owned entities that might be supported by a sovereign state, region or authority. Sovereign-related includes Private Finance Initiative transactions that involve private entities that receive contractual payments for providing services to public sector entities. Global structured finance obligations include asset-backed transactions and financing of commercial activities that are typically secured by undivided interests or collateralized by the related assets or cash flows or, in the case of certain CDS transactions, reference the underlying obligations. Certain policies cover payments potentially due under CDS, including termination payments that may become due in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of certain insolvency or payment defaults under the CDS or derivative contracts by the insured counterparty or by the guarantor. 
 As of December 31, 2018, MBIA Corp. had 348 policies outstanding in its insured portfolio. In addition, MBIA Corp. had 52 insurance policies outstanding relating to liabilities issued by MBIA Inc. and its subsidiaries, which are described further under the section Affiliated Financial Obligations Insured by MBIA Corp. below. MBIA Corp.s total policies in its insured portfolio are diversified among 220 credits, which we define as any group of policies supported by the same revenue source. 
 As of December 31, 2018, the gross par amount outstanding of MBIA Corp.s insured obligations (excluding $1.0 billion of insured affiliated financial obligations and $36.0 billion of U.S. public finance debt ceded to National), was $11.9 billion. Insurance in force for the above portfolio, which includes all insured debt service, as of December 31, 2018 was $16.5 billion. 
 
4 


 Item 1. Business (continued) 
 
MBIA Corp. estimates that the average life of its international and structured finance insurance policies in force as of December 31, 2018 is 8 years. The average life was determined by applying a calculation using the remaining years to contractual maturity for international public finance obligations and estimated maturity for structured finance obligations and weighting them on the basis of the remaining debt service insured. No assumptions were made for any future refundings, early redemptions or terminations of insured issues. Average annual insured debt service on the portfolio as of December 31, 2018 was $1.4 billion. Refer to Note 13: Insurance in Force in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Companys insured portfolio. 
 Affiliated Financial Obligations Insured by MBIA Corp. 
 Prior to 2008, MBIA Inc. provided customized investment agreements and one of its subsidiaries, GFL, issued MTNs with varying maturities. Each of these obligations is guaranteed by MBIA Corp. GFL lent the proceeds of its GFL MTN issuances to MBIA Inc. As a result of ratings downgrades of MBIA Corp., MBIA Inc. is required to post collateral for the remaining investment agreements. Since the ratings downgrades of MBIA Corp. that began in 2008, we have not issued new MTNs or investment agreements. The investment agreements are currently fully collateralized with high quality assets. We believe the outstanding investment agreements and MTNs and corresponding asset balances will continue to decline over time as the liabilities mature, terminate, or are repurchased by the Company. 
 In January of 2017, MBIA Corp. executed a financing facility (the Facility) with affiliates of certain holders of 14% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Surplus Notes of MBIA Corp. (collectively, the Senior Lenders), and with MBIA Inc., pursuant to which the Senior Lenders have provided $325 million of senior financing and MBIA Inc. has provided $38 million of subordinated financing to MZ Funding LLC (MZ Funding), a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which in turn lent the proceeds of such financing to MBIA Corp. MBIA Corp. issued financial guarantee insurance policies insuring MZ Fundings obligations under the Facility. Refer to Note 10: Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information on the Facility. 
 Risk Management 
 Our largest risk is the credit exposure in our insured portfolio. The Companys credit risk management and remediation functions are managed through committees and units that oversee risks in ongoing portfolio surveillance and remediation. The Companys Insured Portfolio Management Division (IPM) monitors and remediates domestic and international public finance and structured risks. National and MBIA Corp. each has its own risk and investment committees that review their respective portfolio and investment-related decisions. 
 The Companys Risk Oversight Committee (the Risk Oversight Committee) reviews material transactions and provides firm-wide review of policies and decisions related to credit, market, operational, legal, financial and business risks. The Company and its subsidiaries respective Loss Reserve Committees review loss reserving activity. 
 The Companys Board of Directors and related Committees, including Audit, and Finance and Risk, oversee risks faced by the Company and its subsidiaries. The Board regularly evaluates and discusses emerging risks and risks associated with strategic initiatives. On an annual basis, the Board also evaluates and approves the Companys risk tolerance policy. The purpose of the risk tolerance policy is to define the types and amounts of risks the Company is prepared to accept. The assessment includes risks associated with credit, capital adequacy, market, liquidity, legal, operations and technology. This policy provides the basis upon which risk criteria and procedures are developed and seeks to have these applied consistently across the Company. 
 The Audit Committee oversees risks associated with financial and other reporting, auditing, legal and regulatory compliance, and risks that may otherwise result from the Companys operations. The Audit Committee oversees these risks by monitoring (i) the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and of other material financial disclosures made by the Company, (ii) the qualifications, independence and performance of the Companys independent auditor, (iii) the performance of the Companys internal audit function, (iv) the Companys compliance policies and procedures and its compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and (v) the performance of the Companys operational risk management function. 
 
5 


 Item 1. Business (continued) 
 
The Finance and Risk Committee oversees the Companys credit risk governance framework, market risk, liquidity risk and other material financial risks. The Finance and Risk Committee oversees these risks by monitoring the Companys: (i) capital and liquidity, (ii) proprietary investment portfolios, (iii) exposure to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities, (iv) credit exposures in the Insured Portfolios, and (v) financial risk policies and procedures, including regulatory requirements and limits. 
 The Company has a designated Model Governance Team. Given the significance of models in the Companys surveillance and remediation activities, financial reporting and corporate treasury operations, the Company established a Model Governance Policy to enhance the consistency, reliability, maintenance and transparency of its models so that model risk can be mitigated on an enterprise-wide basis. The Model Governance Team is responsible for the Model Governance Policy as well as other Model Governance related initiatives. 
 Insurance Surveillance and Remediation 
 We surveil and remediate our insured portfolios on an ongoing basis. Although our monitoring and remediation activities vary somewhat by sector and bond type, in all cases we focus on assessing event risk and potential losses under stress. 

 | U.S. Public Finance: For U.S. public finance, our ongoing credit surveillance focuses on economic and political trends, issuer or project debt and financial management, construction and start up risk, adequacy of historical and anticipated cash flows under stress, satisfactory legal structure and bond security provisions, viable tax and economic bases, including consideration of tax limitations and unemployment trends, adequacy of stressed loss coverage and project feasibility, including satisfactory reports from consulting engineers, traffic advisors and others, if applicable. Depending on the credit, specialized cash flow analyses may be conducted to understand loss sensitivity. In addition, specialized credit analysts consider the potential event risk of natural disasters or headline events on both single obligors/credits and across a sector, as well as regulatory issues. U.S. public finance credits/exposures are monitored by reviewing trustee, issuer and project financial and operating reports as well as reports provided by technical advisors and counsel. Projects may be periodically visited by MBIA personnel.

 | International Public Finance: International public finance credits are monitored and remediated in a manner relatively consistent with U.S. public finance transactions. In addition, credit analysts consider country risk, including economic and political factors, the type and quality of local regulatory oversight, the strength of the legal framework in each country and the stability of the local institutional framework. Analysts also monitor local accounting and legal requirements, local financial market developments, the impact of exchange rates and local demand dynamics. Furthermore, exposures are reviewed periodically; the frequency and scope of review is often increased when an exposure is downgraded. MBIA personnel may periodically visit projects or issuers to meet with management.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Global Structured Finance Transactions: For global structured finance credits, we focus on the historical and projected cash flows generated by the assets, the credit and operational strength of the originator, servicer, manager and/or operator of the assets, and the transactions structure (including the degree of protection from bankruptcy of the originator or servicer). We may use both probability modeling and cash flow sensitivity analysis (both at the transaction and asset specific levels) to test asset performance assumptions and performance covenants, triggers and remedies. In addition, IPM may use various quantitative tools and qualitative analyses to test for credit quality, correlation, liquidity and capital sensitivity within the insured portfolio.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A key to our ongoing monitoring is early detection of deterioration in either obligor credit quality or macroeconomic or market factors that could adversely impact an insured credit. If deterioration is detected, analysts generally evaluate possible remedial actions and, in the event of significant stress, we may develop and implement a remediation strategy. The nature of any remedial action is based on the type of insured issue and the nature and scope of the event giving rise to the remediation. In most cases, as part of any such remedial activity, we work with the issuer, trustee, legal counsel, financial advisors, servicer, other creditors, underwriters and/or other related parties to reduce chances of default and the potential severity of loss if a default should occur. 
 
6 


 Item 1. Business (continued) 
 
We use an internal credit rating system to rank credits, with frequency of review based on risk type, internal rating, performance and credit quality. Credits with performance issues are designated as Caution List-Low, Caution List-Medium or Caution List-High based on the nature and extent of our concerns, but these categories do not require establishment of any case basis reserves. In the event we determine that a claim for payment is expected with respect to an insured issue using probability-weighted cash flows, we place the issue on the Classified List and establish a case basis loss reserve for that insured issue. See Losses and Reserves below for information on our loss reserving process. 
 Credit Risk Models 
 We use credit risk models to test qualitative judgments, to design appropriate structures and to understand sensitivity within transactions and across broader portfolio exposure concentrations. Models are updated to reflect changes in both portfolio and transaction data and also in expectations of stressed future outcomes. For portfolio monitoring we use internal and third-party models based on individual transaction attributes and customized structures and these models are also used to determine case basis loss reserves and, where applicable, to mark-to-market any insured obligations as may be required for financial reporting. When using third-party models, we generally perform the same review and analyses of the collateral, transaction structure, performance triggers and cash flow waterfalls as when using our internal models. See Risk FactorsInsured Portfolio Loss Related Risk FactorsFinancial modeling involves uncertainty over ultimate outcomes which makes it difficult to estimate liquidity, potential paid claims payments, loss reserves and fair values in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.Market Risk Assessment 
 We measure and assess market risk on a consolidated basis as well as at the holding company and subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis. Key market risks are changes in interest rates, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates. We use various models and methodologies to test exposure under market stress scenarios, including parallel and non-parallel shifts in the yield curve, changes in credit spreads, and changes in foreign exchange rates. We also analyze stressed liquidity scenarios and stressed counterparty exposures. The analyses are used in testing investment portfolio guidelines. The Risk Oversight Committee and the Finance and Risk Committee of the Companys Board of Directors receive periodic reports on market risk. 
Operational Risk Assessment 
 The Operational Risk function assesses potential economic loss or reputational impact arising from processes and controls, systems, or staff actions and seeks to identify vulnerabilities to operational disruptions caused by external events. The Operational Risk framework is generally managed using a self-assessment process across our business units, with controls associated with the execution of key processes monitored through Internal Audit reviews. The Operational Risk function reports periodically to the Risk Oversight Committee and the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. The Audit Committee reviews the Companys operational risk profile, risk event activity and ongoing risk mitigation efforts. 
Losses and Reserves 
 Loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) reserves are established by Loss Reserve Committees in each of our operating insurance companies and are reviewed by our executive Loss Reserve Committee, which consists of members of senior management. The Companys loss and LAE reserves as of December 31, 2018 represent case basis reserves and estimates for LAE to be incurred. Case basis reserves represent the Companys estimate of expected losses to be paid under its insurance contracts, net of potential recoveries and discounted using a current risk-free interest rate, for contracts where the estimated loss amount exceeds the unearned premium revenue on the related insurance contract. The Company estimates expected losses net of potential recoveries using the present value of probability-weighted estimated loss payments and recoveries, discounted at a rate equal to the risk-free rate applicable to the currency and weighted average remaining life of the insurance contract as required by accounting principles for financial guarantee contracts. We record case basis loss reserves on insured obligations which have defaulted or are expected to default during the remaining life of the obligation.

 Item 1. Business (continued) 
 
For a further discussion of the methodology used by the Company for determining when a case basis reserve is established, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting EstimatesLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Management believes that our reserves are adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of claims. However, because the reserves are based on managements judgment and estimates, there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed such estimates or that the timing of claims payments and the realization of recoveries will not create liquidity issues for the corresponding insurance company. 
 Reinsurance 
 We currently have third-party reinsurance agreements in place covering 3% of our insured par outstanding. At this time we do not intend to utilize reinsurance to decrease the insured exposure in our portfolio; however, we may, from time to time, look to enter into transactions to reduce risks embedded in our insured portfolios on an individual and portfolio-wide basis.
Intercompany Reinsurance Arrangements 
 MBIA Corp. and National are parties to a reinsurance agreement pursuant to which National reinsures certain public finance financial guarantee policies originally written by MBIA Corp., as well as an assignment agreement under which MBIA Corp. assigned to National its rights and obligations under public finance financial guarantee policies of Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC) which were originally reinsured by MBIA Corp., and ultimately novated to National pursuant to a novation agreement between National and FGIC effective August of 2013. In addition, National entered into second-to-pay policies covering the policies covered by each of these agreements. The reinsurance agreement pursuant to which MBIA Corp. had reinsured the FGIC public finance guarantee policies was terminated in 2013 in connection with the novation to National of the policies covered by the agreement. 
 MBIA Insurance Corporation maintains a reinsurance agreement and net worth maintenance agreement with MBIA Mexico pursuant to which MBIA Insurance Corporation reinsures 100% of the business underwritten by MBIA Mexico and agrees to maintain the amount of capital in MBIA Mexico required by applicable law or regulation, subject to certain New York State regulatory requirements as well as certain contract restrictions. 
 Insurance Regulation 
 National and MBIA Insurance Corporation are incorporated in and subject to primary insurance regulation and supervision by the State of New York. MBIA Corp.s Spanish Branch is subject to local regulation in Spain. MBIA Mexico is organized and subject to primary regulation and supervision in Mexico. The Companys insurance subsidiaries are also licensed to issue financial guarantee policies in multiple jurisdictions as needed to conduct their business activities. 
 The extent of state and national insurance regulation and supervision varies by jurisdiction, but New York, Spain, Mexico and most other jurisdictions have laws and regulations prescribing minimum standards of solvency, including minimum capital requirements, and business conduct which must be maintained by insurance companies, and if our insurance companies fail to meet such requirements our regulators may impose certain remedial actions. Among other regulated conduct, these laws and regulations prescribe permitted classes and concentrations of investments. In addition, some state laws and regulations require the approval or filing of policy forms and rates. MBIA Insurance Corporation and National each are required to file detailed annual financial statements with the NYSDFS and similar supervisory agencies in each of the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed. The operations and accounts of the insurance companies are subject to examination by regulatory agencies at regular intervals. In addition to being subject to the insurance laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, as a condition to obtaining required insurance regulatory approvals to enter into certain transactions and take certain other corporate actions, including the release of excessive contingency reserves in MBIA Insurance Corporation described below under Contingency Reserves and entry into the asset swap between MBIA Inc. and National described under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidityCorporate Liquidity in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, MBIA Inc. and its operating insurance subsidiaries have and may in the future agree to provide notice to the NYSDFS or other applicable regulators prior to entering into transactions or taking other corporate actions (such as paying dividends when applicable statutory tests are satisfied) that would not otherwise require regulatory approval.

 Item 1. Business (continued) 
New York Insurance Regulation 
 Our domestic insurance companies are licensed to provide financial guarantee insurance under Article 69 of the New York Insurance Law (the NYIL). Article 69 defines financial guarantee insurance to include any guarantee under which loss is payable upon proof of occurrence of financial loss to an insured as a result of certain events. These events include the failure of any obligor or any issuer of any debt instrument or other monetary obligation to pay principal, interest, premium, dividend or purchase price of or on such instrument or obligation when due. Under Article 69, our domestic insurance companies are permitted to transact financial guarantee insurance, surety insurance and credit insurance and such other kinds of business to the extent necessarily or properly incidental to the kinds of insurance which they are authorized to transact. In addition, they are empowered to assume or reinsure the kinds of insurance described above. Amendments to the statutes or regulations governing financial guarantee insurers are possible, but the adoption or timing of any such amendments is uncertain. 
New York State Dividend Limitations 
 The laws of New York regulate the payment of dividends by National and MBIA Insurance Corporation and provide that a New York domestic stock property/casualty insurance company may not declare or distribute dividends except out of statutory earned surplus. New York law provides that the sum of (i) the amount of dividends declared or distributed during the preceding 12-month period and (ii) the dividend to be declared may not exceed the lesser of (a) 10% of policyholders surplus, as shown by the most recent statutory financial statement on file with the NYSDFS, or (b) 100% of adjusted net investment income for such 12-month period (the net investment income for such 12-month period plus the excess, if any, of net investment income over dividends declared or distributed during the two-year period preceding such 12-month period), unless the Superintendent of Financial Services of the State of New York (the Superintendent) approves a greater dividend distribution based upon a finding that the insurer will retain sufficient surplus to support its obligations and writings. 
 National declared and paid a dividend of $108 million to its ultimate parent, MBIA Inc., during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 Due to its significant earned surplus deficit, MBIA Insurance Corporation has not had the statutory capacity to pay dividends since December 31, 2009 and is not expected to have any statutory capacity to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. In connection with MBIA Insurance Corporation obtaining approval from the NYSDFS to release excessive contingency reserves as of September 30, 2011, December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2012, MBIA Corp. agreed that it would not pay any dividends without receiving prior approval from the NYSDFS. The foregoing dividend limitations are determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles (U.S. STAT). 
 Contingency Reserves 
 As financial guarantee insurers, our domestic insurance companies are required by the laws and regulations of New York and other states to maintain, as applicable, contingency reserves on their municipal bond, asset-backed securities (ABS) or other financial guarantee liabilities. Under New York law, a financial guarantee insurance company is required to contribute to contingency reserves 50% of premiums as they are earned on policies written prior to July 1, 1989 (net of reinsurance), and, with respect to policies written on and after July 1, 1989, such an insurer must make contributions over a period of 15 or 20 years (based on issue type), or until the contingency reserve for such insured issues equals the greater of 50% of premiums written for the relevant category of insurance or a percentage of the principal guaranteed, varying from 0.55% to 2.5%, depending upon the type of obligation guaranteed (net of collateral, reinsurance, refunding, refinancings and certain insured securities). Other states maintain similar requirements. The contribution to, and maintenance of, the contingency reserve limits the amount of earned surplus that might otherwise be available for the payment of dividends. In each state, our domestic insurance companies may apply for release of portions of their contingency reserves in certain circumstances.

Risk Limits 
 Insurance laws and regulations also limit both the aggregate and individual securities risks that our domestic insurance companies may insure on a net basis based on the type of obligations insured. The individual limits are generally on the amount of insured par and/or annual debt service for a given insured issue, entity or revenues source and stated as a percentage of the insurers policyholders surplus and contingency reserves. The aggregate risk limits limit the aggregate amount of insured par to a stated multiple of the insurers policyholders surplus and contingency reserves based on the types of obligations insured. The aggregate risk limits can range from 300:1 for certain municipal obligations to 50:1 for certain non-municipal obligations. 
 National is in compliance with the relevant aggregate and single risk limits. During 2018 and 2017, MBIA Insurance Corporation reported single risk limit overages to the NYSDFS due to changes in its statutory capital. MBIA Insurance Corporation is in compliance with its aggregate risk limits as of December 31, 2018. 
 Holding Company Regulation 
 MBIA Inc., National and MBIA Insurance Corporation also are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company statutes of New York. The requirements of holding company statutes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but generally require insurance companies that are part of an insurance holding company system to register and file certain reports describing, among other information, their capital structure, ownership and financial condition. The holding company statutes also generally require prior approval of changes in control, of certain dividends and other inter-corporate transfers of assets, and of certain transactions between insurance companies, their parents and affiliates. The holding company statutes impose standards on certain transactions with related companies, which include, among other requirements, that all transactions be fair and reasonable and those transactions not in the ordinary course of business exceeding specified limits receive prior regulatory approval. 
Change of Control 
 Prior approval by the NYSDFS is required for any entity seeking to acquire, directly or indirectly, control of National or MBIA Insurance Corporation. In many states, including New York, control is presumed to exist if 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by an entity, although the insurance regulator may find that control in fact does or does not exist when an entity owns or controls either a lesser or greater amount of securities. MBIA Insurance Corporation would require the prior approval of MBIA Mexicos regulator in order to transfer the shares it currently holds in MBIA Mexico. 
Insurance Guarantee Funds 
 National and MBIA Insurance Corporation are exempt from assessments by the insurance guarantee funds in the majority of the states in which they do business. Guarantee fund laws in most states require insurers transacting business in the state to participate in guarantee associations, which pay claims of policyholders and third-party claimants against impaired or insolvent insurance companies doing business in the state. In most states, insurers licensed to write only municipal bond insurance, financial guarantee insurance and other forms of surety insurance are exempt from assessment by these funds and their policyholders are prohibited from making claims on these funds. 
INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENT POLICY 
 Investment objectives, policies and guidelines related to the Companys businesses are generally subject to review and approval by the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Investment objectives, policies and guidelines related to investment activity on behalf of our insurance companies are also subject to review and approval by the respective Investment Committee of their Boards of Directors or similar body.

Insight Investment manages the proprietary investment portfolios of the Company and its subsidiaries in accordance with the guidelines adopted for each such portfolio. The agreements with Insight Investment provide generally that Insight Investment will have the exclusive right to manage the fixed-income investment portfolios of the Company and its subsidiaries until December 31, 2019 and guarantee certain minimum revenues thereunder. The agreements are subject to early termination under certain conditions including if certain performance objectives are not met. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the Company reached an agreement in principle to extend the contract with Insight Investment, with modifications, beyond its current term. 
 To continue to optimize capital resources and provide for claims-paying capabilities, the investment objectives and policies of our operations are tailored to reflect their various strategies and operating conditions. The investment objectives of National set preservation of capital as the primary objective, subject to an appropriate degree of liquidity, and optimization of after-tax income and total return as secondary objectives. The investment objectives of MBIA Corp. are primarily to maintain adequate liquidity to meet claims-paying and other corporate needs and secondarily to maximize after-tax income within defined investment risk limits. The investment objectives of the corporate segment are to provide sufficient liquidity to meet maturing liabilities and, in the case of the investment agreement business collateral posting obligations, while maximizing the total long-term return. 
 RATING AGENCIES 
 In the fourth quarter of 2017, both S&P and Kroll Bond Rating Agency (Kroll) withdrew their financial strength ratings on MBIA Inc. and its subsidiaries, National and MBIA Corp, as contracted, following notice from the Company terminating the agreements by which both rating agencies agreed to provide financial strength ratings. Prior to withdrawal of their respective ratings Kroll downgraded the rating of National from AA+ to AA with a negative outlook and S&P affirmed the National A with a stable outlook. Also in the fourth quarter of 2017, MBIA Inc., on behalf of its subsidiaries, National and MBIA Corp, provided similar notice to Moodys Investors Services (Moodys) terminating the agreement by which Moodys agreed to provide financial strength ratings to MBIA Inc., National, MBIA Corp. and MBIA Mexico. In January of 2018, Moodys downgraded the rating of National from A3 with a negative outlook to Baa2 with a stable outlook. Similarly, Moodys downgraded the rating of MBIA Inc. from Ba1 with a negative outlook to Ba3 with a stable outlook. The rating of MBIA Corp. was affirmed at Caa1 with a developing outlook. The rating of MBIA Mexico was affirmed at Caa1/B3.mx with a developing outlook. Moodys, at its discretion and in the absence of a contract with the Company, continues to maintain ratings on MBIA Inc. and its subsidiaries.
