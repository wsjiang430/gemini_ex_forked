Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

Background
 
The Company is a Delaware corporation, which was formed in 2005. It operates through operating subsidiaries, including InfuSystem Holdings USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation, InfuSystem, Inc., a California corporation (“ISI”), First Biomedical, Inc., a Kansas corporation (“First Biomedical”) and IFC, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
Business Concept and Strategy
 
We are a leading provider of infusion pumps and related products and services for patients in the home, oncology clinics, ambulatory surgery centers, and other sites of care from five locations in the United States and Canada. We provide our products and services to hospitals, oncology practices and facilities and other alternate site health care providers. Headquartered in Madison Heights, Michigan, we deliver local, field-based customer support as well as operate pump service and repair Centers of Excellence in Michigan, Kansas, California, Massachusetts and Ontario, Canada. ISI is accredited by the Community Health Accreditation Program (“CHAP”) while First Biomedical is ISO certified.
 
Our core service is to supply electronic ambulatory infusion pumps and associated disposable supply kits to private oncology clinics, infusion clinics and hospital outpatient oncology clinics to be utilized in the treatment of a variety of cancers including colorectal cancer, pain management and other disease states (“Oncology Business”). Colorectal cancer is the third most prevalent form of cancer in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society, and the standard of care for the treatment of colorectal cancer relies upon continuous chemotherapy infusions delivered via ambulatory infusion pumps.
 
In addition, we sell or rent new and pre-owned pole-mounted and ambulatory infusion pumps to, and provide biomedical recertification, maintenance and repair services for oncology practices as well as other alternate site settings including home care and home infusion providers, skilled nursing facilities, pain centers and others. We also provide these products and services to customers in the hospital market.
 
We purchase new and pre-owned pole-mounted and ambulatory infusion pumps from a variety of sources on a non-exclusive basis. We repair, refurbish and provide biomedical certification for the devices as needed. The pumps are then available for sale, rental or to be used within our ambulatory infusion pump management service.
 
One goal of our business strategy is to expand into treatment of other cancers. In 2018, our Oncology Business approximated 60% of our total revenues. In 2018, we generated approximately 34% of our total revenues from treatments for colorectal cancer and 26% of our revenues from treatments for non-colorectal disease states. There are a number of approved treatment protocols for pancreatic, head and neck, esophageal and other cancers, as well as other disease states which present opportunities for growth. There are also a number of other drugs currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), as well as agents in the pharmaceutical development pipeline, which we believe could potentially be used with continuous infusion protocols for the treatment of diseases other than colorectal cancer. Additional drugs or protocols currently in clinical trials may also obtain regulatory approval over the next several years. If these new drugs or protocols obtain regulatory approval for use with continuous infusion protocols, we expect the pharmaceutical companies to focus their sales and marketing efforts on promoting the new drugs and protocols to physicians.
 
Another aspect of our business is to seek opportunities to leverage our extensive billing capabilities, pump resources and networks of oncology practices and insurers. This leverage may take the form of new products and/or services, strategic alliances, joint ventures and/or acquisitions. One of these is providing our ambulatory pumps, products, and services for pain management in the area of post-surgical peripheral nerve block. With regard to acquisitions, we believe there are additional opportunities, beyond our acquisition of Ciscura Holding Company, Inc., and its subsidiaries (“Ciscura”) in April 2015, to acquire smaller, regional competitors, in whole or part that perform similar services to us but do not have the national market access, network of third-party payor contracts or operating economies of scale that we currently enjoy. We also plan to leverage our extensive networks of oncology practices and insurers by distributing complementary products, including pain management and smart pumps, and introducing key new information technology-based services such as EXPRESS, InfuSystem Mobile, InfuBus or InfuConnect, Pump Portal and BlockPain Dashboard®.

We face the risk that other competitors can provide the same services as we provide. That risk is currently mitigated and barriers to entry are created by our (i) growing number of third-party payor networks under contract, which included nearly 600 third-party payor networks for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 13% over the prior year period; (ii) economies of scale, which allow for predictable reimbursement and less costly purchase and management of the pumps, respectively; (iii) established, long-standing relationships as a provider of pumps to outpatient oncology practices in the U.S. and Canada; (iv) pump fleet of ambulatory and large volume infusion pumps for rent and for sale, which may allow us to be more responsive to the needs of physicians, outpatient oncology practices, hospitals, outpatient surgery centers, homecare practices, patient rehabilitation centers and patients than a new market entrant; (v) five geographic locations in the U.S. and Canada that allow for same day or next day delivery of pumps; and (vi) pump repair and service capabilities at all of these facilities. We do not perform any research and development on pumps, but we have made, and continue to make, significant investments in developing our information technology as described below.
 
Management is intent on extending its considerable breadth of payor networks under contract as patients move into different insurance coverages, including Medicaid and Insurance Marketplace products. In some cases, this may slightly reduce our aggregate billed revenues payment rate but result in an overall increase in collected revenues, due to a reduction in bad debt expense. Consequently, we are increasingly focused on net revenues less bad debt.
 
In the midst of changes in the healthcare arena, we believe that we will support our overall business strategy discussed above by (i) focusing on supporting recurring revenues by increasing our pump fleet; (ii) improving liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet by keeping debt levels comparable to our operations; (iii) improving internal operational efficiencies; (iv) increasing our product and services offerings; (v) enhancing our technology offerings to the patients and providers of care; and (vi) investigating synergistic acquisitions.
 
Continuous Infusion Therapy
 
Continuous infusion of chemotherapy involves the gradual administration of a drug via a small, lightweight, portable infusion pump over a prolonged period of time. A cancer patient can receive his or her medicine anywhere from one to 30 days per month depending on the chemotherapy regimen that is most appropriate to that individual’s health status and disease state. This may be followed by periods of rest and then repeated cycles with treatment goals of progression-free disease survival. This drug administration method has replaced intravenous push or bolus administration in specific circumstances. The advantages of slow continuous low doses of certain drugs are well documented. Clinical studies support the use of continuous infusion chemotherapy for decreased toxicity without loss of anti-tumor efficacy. The 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”) Guidelines recommend the use of continuous infusion for treatment of numerous cancer diagnoses. We believe that the growth of continuous infusion therapy is driven by three factors: evidence of improved clinical outcomes; lower toxicity and side effects; and a favorable reimbursement environment.
 
Significant recent progress has been made in the treatment of colorectal cancer due to advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In the late 1990s, medical researchers discovered that the delivery method of the drug (or schedule) was a key component to drug availability, efficacy and tolerability. Schedule dependent anti-tumor activity and toxicity has resulted in continuous infusion 5-Fluorouracil being adopted as the standard of care. In 2000, the FDA approved Camptosar (the trade name for the generic chemotherapy drug Irinotecan), a drug developed by Pfizer, for first-line therapy in combination with 5-Fluorouracil for the treatment of colorectal cancer. In 2002, the FDA approved Eloxatin (the trade name for the generic chemotherapy drug Oxaliplatin), a drug developed by Sanofi-Aventis, for use in combination with continuous infusion 5-Fluorouracil for the treatment of colorectal cancer. FOLFIRI, the chemotherapy protocol which includes Camptosar in combination with continuous infusion 5-Fluorouracil and the drug Leucovorin, and FOLFOX, the chemotherapy protocol which includes Eloxatin in combination with continuous infusion 5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin, have resulted in significantly improved overall survival rates for colorectal cancer patients at various stages of the disease state. We believe that Sanofi-Aventis and Pfizer have each dedicated significant resources to educating physicians and promoting the use of FOLFOX and FOLFIRI. Simultaneously, the NCCN has established these regimens as the standards of care for the treatment of colorectal cancer.
 
The use of continuous infusion has been demonstrated to decrease or alter the toxicity of a number of cytotoxic, or cell killing agents. Higher doses of drugs can be infused over longer periods of time, leading to improved tolerance and decreased toxicity. For example, the cardiotoxicity (heart muscle damage) of the chemotherapy drug Doxorubicin is decreased by schedules of administration according to The Chemotherapy Source Book by Michael C. Perry. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and decreased white blood cell and platelet counts are all affected by duration of delivery. Continuous infusion can lead to improved tolerance and patient comfort while enhancing the patient’s ability to remain on the chemotherapy regimen. Additionally, the lower toxicity profile and resulting reduction in side effects enables patients undergoing continuous infusion therapy to continue a relatively normal lifestyle, which may include continuing to work, going shopping, and caring for family members. We believe that the partnering of physician management and patient autonomy provide for the highest quality of care with the greatest patient satisfaction.
 
We believe that oncology practices have a heightened sensitivity to providing quality service and whether they are reimbursed for services they provide. Simultaneously, CMS and private insurers are increasingly focused on evidence-based medicine to inform their reimbursement decisions — that is, aligning reimbursement with clinical outcomes and adherence to standards of care. Continuous infusion therapy is a main component of the standard of care for certain cancer types because clinical evidence demonstrates superior outcomes. Payors’ recognition of this benefit is reflected in their relative reimbursement policies for clinical services related to the delivery of this care.

Services
 
Our core service is our Oncology Business. After providing ambulatory pumps to oncology offices, infusion clinics and hospital and outpatient chemotherapy clinics, we then directly bill and collect payment from payors and patients for the use of these pumps. At any given time, our pumps are in the possession of these facilities, on a patient, in transport, or in our facilities for cleaning, calibration and storage as reserves for increased demand.
 
After a physician determines that a patient is eligible for ambulatory infusion pump therapy, the physician arranges for the patient to receive an infusion pump and provides the necessary chemotherapy drugs. The physician and nursing staff train the patient in the use of the pump and initiate service. The physician bills the payors, which may include Medicare, Medicaid, third-party payor companies or patients for the physician’s professional services associated with initiating and supervising the infusion pump administration, as well as the supply of drugs. We directly bill (i) payors, (ii) facilities of our Medicare patients and (iii) patients for the use of the pump and related disposable supplies. Billing to payors requires coordination with patients and physicians who initiate the service, as physicians’ offices must provide us with appropriate documentation (patient’s insurance information, physician’s order, an acknowledgement of benefits that shows receipt of equipment by the patient, and, in some cases, physician’s progress notes) in order for us to submit a bill to the payors. We do provide assistance to those that cannot afford our pumps via our financial hardship program – a program that usually matches what our physician practices provide as long as the uninsured patients meet certain criteria. This billing process is handled from our Madison Heights, Michigan location.
 
In addition to providing high quality and convenient care, we believe that our business offers significant economic benefits for patients, providers and payors.
 

● | We support our patients throughout the treatment process by providing patients with 24x7 service and support. InfuSystem Mobile provides patients with secure, two-way communication with our clinical support team, the latest infusion safety technology, and infusion therapy expertise in a convenient and easy-to-use app. Our clinical support team employs oncology, pain, Intravenous Certified, and Oncology Certified registered nurses trained on ambulatory infusion pump equipment who staff our 24x7 hotline to address questions that patients may have about their pump treatment, the infusion pumps or other medical or technical questions related to the pumps
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Physicians use our services to outsource the capital commitment, pump service, maintenance and billing and administrative burdens associated with pump ownership. Our services also allow the doctor to continue a direct relationship with the patient and to receive professional service fees for setting up the treatment and administering the drugs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We provide methods for the physician offices to deliver the appropriate paperwork for billing through a number of electronic means including EXPRESS and InfuConnect reducing the required effort on the employees of the physician offices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We believe our services are attractive to payors because such services are generally less expensive than hospitalization or home care.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Other services we offer include the rental, sale or leasing of pole-mounted and ambulatory infusion pumps to oncology practices, hospitals and other clinical settings. As of December 31, 2018, our rental fleet of pole-mounted and ambulatory pumps had a historical gross cost of $61.4 million, up from $57.9 million at the end of 2017, and included approximately 120 makes and models of equipment dedicated to our rental services. These pumps are available for daily, weekly, monthly or annual rental periods. As of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had a fleet of new and used pole-mounted and ambulatory pumps with a historical cost of $1.6 million for sale or rental.
 
In addition to sales, rental and leasing services, we also provide biomedical maintenance, repair and certification services for the devices we offer as well as for devices owned by customers but not acquired from us. We operate pump service and repair “Centers of Excellence” from all of our locations across the United States and Canada and employ a staff of highly trained technicians to provide these services. Our main Center of Excellence for service is our Lenexa, Kansas facility.
 
We also offer pain management services via electronic ambulatory infusion pumps for post-operative pain management using our pumps along with a numbing agent and a continuous nerve block catheter – continuous peripheral nerve block (“CPNB”). Using CPNB for the management of post-operative pain, which usually lasts two to three days after surgery, can result in reduced pain for the patient, increased satisfaction scores for the surgical center or hospital, and reduced need for post-operative opioid pain medication. These services include our patient care call center interaction offering support to patients and the review and collection of pain score patient outcome data for outpatient surgery centers using our proprietary BlockPain Dashboard®.

Information Technology
 
Our Information Technology (“IT”) department is focused on not only supporting our internal IT infrastructure needs, but also supports InfuSystem Mobile as well as our electronic medical record technology (“EMR”) that allows medical facilities to use our infusion pumps and services via our solutions such as EXPRESS and InfuConnect. This focus has enabled current billing information to be transferred to us from participating facilities electronically and automatically, bypassing the current methods of mail, email, and/or facsimile. We expect that this focus will continue to strengthen our relationships with our existing customers and result in additional investment in intangible software assets by the Company. An additional IT customer-focused solution is PumpPortal. Our focus on IT solutions resulted in the development of EXPRESS, a product powered by our InfuBus data integration platform, and provides for paperless delivery of the appropriate information for InfuSystem to bill payors that:

● | eliminates all paper;
--+----------------------


● | provides an enhanced visibility as a result of real time status and reporting;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduces risk of error;
--+-----------------------


● | automates treatment logs, pump assignments, tracking and physician’s orders;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provides a secure scanner for easy pump assignment to patients; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | removes interruptions from physician practices’ daily schedules, and standardizes data flow for clinics and hospitals with multiple locations
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In 2018 and 2017, we capitalized less than $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of IT projects as we successfully leveraged prior capitalized investments.
 
Relationships with Physician Offices
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had business relationships with clinical oncologists in over 1,800 outpatient oncology clinics. Although this represents a substantial number of the oncologists in the United States, we believe that we can continue to expand our network to further penetrate the oncology market. Based on our retention rates and the positive results of our professional customer satisfaction research, we believe our relationships with physician offices are strong.
 
We believe that, in general, we do not compete directly with hospitals and physician offices to treat patients. Rather, by providing products and services to hospitals and physician offices and other care facilities and providers, we believe that we assist other providers in meeting increasing patient demand and managing institutional constraints on capital and manpower due to the nature of limited resources in hospitals and physician offices.
 
Physician practices in the oncology field are following the overall healthcare practices trend to consolidate. However, as of December 31, 2018, we had gained more facilities than we had lost. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 251 employees, including 237 full-time employees and 14 part-time or contract employees. None of our employees are unionized.
 
Material Suppliers
 
We supply a wide variety of pumps and associated equipment, as well as disposables and ancillary supplies. The majority of our pumps are electronic infusion pumps. Smiths Medical, Inc. and Moog Medical Devices Group each supply more than 10% of the ambulatory pumps purchased by us. The Company has a supply agreement in place with each of these suppliers. Certain “spot” purchases are made on the open market subject to individual negotiation.
Seasonality
 
Our business rental activity is not subject to seasonality. Revenues from this activity, net of bad debt, may be seasonal due to the impact of co-pays and deductibles for patients’ insurance that traditionally reset each January. This has been further impacted by changes in the insurance industry as it responds to increased government regulation. Also, rental customers tend to make buy versus rent decisions late in the year as customer capital budgets are being finalized, impacting sales revenue in the second half of the year, predominantly in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, as the Company’s liquidity has improved, opportunistic pump purchases are made from time to time. These opportunistic pump purchases also allow for opportunistic pump sales, which could be material. The timing of such purchases and sales vary within the course of a year.

Environmental Laws
 
We are required to comply with applicable federal, state and local environmental laws regulating the disposal of cleaning agents used in the process of cleaning our ambulatory infusion pumps, as well as the disposal of sharps and blood products used in connection with the pumps. We do not believe that compliance with such laws has a material effect on our business.
Significant Customers
 
We have sought to establish contracts with as many third-party payor organizations as commercially practicable, in an effort to ensure that reimbursement is not a significant obstacle for providers who recommend continuous infusion therapy and wish to utilize our services. A third-party payor organization is a health care payor or a group of medical services payors that contracts to provide a wide variety of health care services to enrolled members through participating providers such as us. A payor is any entity that pays on behalf of a member patient.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had contracts with nearly 600 third-party payor networks, an increase of 13% over the prior year period. Material terms of contracts with third-party payor organizations are typically a pre-negotiated fee schedule rate or a then-current proprietary fee schedule rate for equipment and supplies provided. The majority of these contracts generally provide for a term of one year, with automatic one-year renewals, unless we or the contracted payor elect not to renew. For 2018 and 2017, our largest contracted payor was a national payor which accounted for approximately 7% and 6% of our net revenues from our third-party payor Oncology Business for 2018 and 2017, respectively, and approximately 4% of our total net revenues for each of 2018 and 2017.
 
We also contract with various other third-party payor organizations, Medicaid, commercial Medicare replacement plans, self-insured plans, facilities of our Medicare patients and numerous other insurance carriers. Other than the payor noted above, no other single payor represented more than 7% of third-party payor net revenue.
 
Competitors
 
We believe that our competition is primarily comprised of national, regional, and hospital-owned DME providers, physician providers and home care infusion providers and the competitive products and services they offer. An estimate of the number of competitors is not known or reasonably available, due to the wide variety in type and size of the market participants described below. We are not aware of any industry reports with respect to the competitive market described below. The description of market segments and business activities within those market segments is based on our experiences in the industry.

● | National DME Providers: Other national providers with offerings similar to us. These products and service offerings include, but are not limited to, third-party reimbursement, direct rental and sale of infusion electronic and disposal pumps and related products and services for patients in the home, oncology clinics, ambulatory surgery centers, and other sites of care.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regional DME Providers: Regional DME providers act as distributors for a variety of medical products. We believe regional DME provider sales forces generally consist of a relatively small number of salespeople, usually covering several states. Regional DME providers tend to carry a limited selection of infusion pumps and their salespeople generally have limited resources. Regional DME providers usually do not have 24x7 nursing services. We believe that regional DME providers have relatively few third-party payor contracts, which may prevent these providers from being paid at acceptable levels and may also result in higher out-of-pocket costs for patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hospital-owned DME Providers: Many hospitals have in-house DME providers to supply basic equipment. In general, however, these providers have limited capital and tend to stock a small inventory of infusion pumps. We believe that hospital-owned providers have limited ability to grow because of limited patient populations. Growth from outside of the hospital may pose a challenge because hospitals typically will not provide referrals to competitors, instead preferring to offer patients a choice of non-hospital-affiliated DME providers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Physician Providers: A limited number of physicians maintain an inventory of their own infusion pumps and provide them to patients for a fee. However, we believe that pump utilization in this area tends to be low and the costs associated with ongoing supplies, preventative maintenance and repairs can be relatively high. Moreover, we believe that a high percentage of DME claims by doctors are rejected by payors upon first submission, requiring a physician’s staff to spend significant time and effort to resubmit claims and receive payment for treatment. The numerous service and technical questions from patients may present another significant cost to a physician provider’s staff.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Home Care Infusion Providers: Home care infusion providers provide chemotherapy drugs and services to allow for in-home patient treatment. We believe that home care infusion treatment can be very costly and that many patients do not carry insurance coverage that covers home-based infusion services, resulting in larger out-of-pocket costs. Because home care treatments may take as long as six months, these costs can be high and can result in higher patient co-payments. We believe that home care providers may also be reluctant to offer 24x7 coverage or additional patient visits, due to capped fees.

Regulation of Our Business
 
Our business is subject to certain regulations. Specifically, as a registered Medicare supplier of DME and related supplies, we must comply with supplier standards established by CMS regulating Medicare suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (“DMEPOS Supplier Standards”). The DMEPOS Supplier Standards consist of 30 requirements that must be met in order for a DMEPOS supplier to be eligible to receive payment for a Medicare-covered item. Some of the more significant DMEPOS Supplier Standards require us to (i) advise Medicare beneficiaries of their option to purchase certain equipment, (ii) honor all warranties under state law and not charge Medicare beneficiaries for the repair or replacement of equipment or for services covered under warranty, (iii) permit CMS agents to conduct on-site inspections to ascertain compliance with the DMEPOS Supplier Standards, (iv) maintain liability insurance in prescribed amounts, (v) refrain from contacting Medicare beneficiaries by telephone, except in certain limited circumstances, (vi) answer questions and respond to complaints of beneficiaries regarding the supplied equipment, (vii) disclose the DMEPOS Supplier Standards to each Medicare beneficiary to whom we supply equipment, (viii) maintain a complaint resolution procedure and record certain information regarding each complaint, (ix) maintain accreditation from a CMS approved accreditation organization, and (x) meet certain specified surety bond requirements.
 
We are also subject to the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which are designed to protect the security and confidentiality of certain protected health information. Under HIPAA, we must provide patients access to certain records and must notify patients of our use of protected health information and patient privacy rights. Moreover, HIPAA sets limits on how we may use individually identifiable health information and prohibits the use of patient information for marketing purposes. The adoption of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) includes a new breach notification requirement that applies to breaches of unsecured health information occurring on or after September 23, 2009. We are subject to regulations in the various states in which we operate. We believe we are in material compliance with all such regulations.
 
In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, imposes a 2.3% excise tax on medical devices that applies to sales within the United States of a majority of our pump products that we purchase. This law imposes an excise tax on the first sale of medical devices by a manufacturer, producer, or importer equal to 2.3% of the sales price. This tax only applies directly to new pumps that we purchase from manufacturers. Taxable medical devices include any device as defined in Section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act intended for humans, with the exception of eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids and any other device determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to be a type which is generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use. On December 18, 2015, under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax was imposed by Section 4191 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). On January 22, 2018, the H.R. 195: Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act Bill extended the existing suspensions of the ACA’s medical device excise tax through 2019. Thus, the medical device excise tax does not apply to the sale of a taxable medical device by the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the device during the period beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2019. Future legislation could have a material effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
