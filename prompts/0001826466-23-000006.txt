Item 1. BUSINESSGeneral
Golden Growers Cooperative is a value-added agricultural cooperative association owned by 1,480 members primarily from Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, all of whom deliver corn to the Cooperative for processing. The Cooperative was originally formed in 1994 as a North Dakota agricultural cooperative with the goal of allowing its members to receive additional value from the corn that they grow through the processing of that corn into value-added products, such as corn sweeteners. The Cooperative accomplished this purpose by forming a joint venture with  American Crystal Sugar Company (American Crystal) that formed ProGold Limited Liability Company (ProGold), a Minnesota limited liability company that designed and constructed a corn wet-milling facility in Wahpeton, North Dakota to process corn into high fructose corn syrup and related co-products. The Cooperatives membership in ProGold LLC includes a right and obligation for the Cooperative to deliver corn to the ProGold facility for processing. The Cooperatives members deliver corn to the ProGold facility on the Cooperatives behalf to meet this delivery obligation.
 On November 1, 1997, ProGold entered into an operating lease with Cargill Incorporated (Cargill) for the entire ProGold facility. Cargill has operated the facility continually since this time. While ProGold no longer operates the wet-milling facility, the Cooperative, through its members, continues to have an obligation to deliver corn directly to Cargill at the wet-milling facility.

On September 1, 2009, by way of a series of mergers, the Cooperative changed its domicile and form of entity from a North Dakota cooperative to a Minnesota cooperative association governed under Minnesota Statutes Chapter 308B. The Cooperative operates as a cooperative for state law purposes but is treated as a partnership under Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) for tax purposes. 
 Additional information about the Cooperative can be found on our website, https://goldengrowers.com. We are neither including nor incorporating by reference herein the information contained on our corporate website. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). The Exchange Act requires us to file periodic reports and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. These materials may be obtained electronically by accessing the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov. 
 Business Operations
The Cooperative is in the business of providing value to its members by facilitating their delivery of corn to the corn wet-milling facility owned by ProGold. We accomplish our business on behalf of our members not through the ownership of assets such as a plant and equipment, but through our contract relationships with all of the parties involved in the ownership and operation of the facility. From an income production perspective, our membership interest in ProGold is our primary asset that, in addition to giving the Cooperative the right to receive distributions from ProGold, also provides our members with additional value for the delivery of their corn for processing. Cargill is also an integral part of our financial success. Cargill provides the Cooperative grain services that allow us to facilitate corn delivery to the ProGold facility at little or no expense. In addition, the lease payments Cargill makes to ProGold that are in turn distributed to the Cooperative provide us with the cash to make distributions to our members. 
 Ownership in ProGold 
 Prior to March 1, 2022, the Cooperative and American Crystal owned a 49% interest and 51% in ProGold, respectively. On April 4, 2017, ProGold and Cargill entered into a Second Amended and Restated Facility Lease (the Facility Lease), which commenced on January 1, 2018 and continued through December 31, 2022. On the same day, the Cooperative, Cargill, and American Crystal entered into a Consent Agreement, effective on January 1, 2018 (the Consent Agreement), relating to the Facility Lease and the Cooperatives interest in ProGold, and Cargill and American Crystal entered into an Option Agreement, effective on January 1, 2018 (the Option Agreement), detailing the price, term and other conditions under which American Crystal granted to Cargill an exclusive option (the Option) to purchase a 50% interest in ProGold from American Crystal during the first four years of the Facility Lease. Under the Consent Agreement, the Cooperative approved and consented to the transfer of the 50% interest in ProGold from American Crystal to Cargill in the event Cargill exercised its option. The Cooperative also secured the right to purchase American Crystals remaining 1% interest in ProGold for a base price ranging from $1.7 million to $1.3 million, depending on the timing of Cargills notification to American Crystal of its intention to exercise its option. The Cooperative was also required to pay to American Crystal a capital adjustment in an amount equal to 1% of the portion of costs that had not been paid by Cargill to ProGold through additional rent with respect to certain projects at the facility.
 Cargill exercised its Option under the Option Agreement to purchase a 50% interest in ProGold from American Crystal. Simultaneously with the exercise of the Option, the Cooperative, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, elected to purchase American Crystals remaining 1% interest in ProGold. As a result of these transactions, effective March 1, 2022, the Cooperative and Cargill each own a 50% interest in ProGold.
 In connection with Cargills exercise of its Option under the Option Agreement, the Cooperative, Cargill and ProGold entered into that certain ProGold Limited Liability Company Agreement (the Operating Agreement), effective March 1, 2022, in order to set forth the structure, governance and operation of ProGold according to certain operational principles and other guidelines described in the Consent Agreement. Beginning March 1, 2022, the Cooperative allocated 50% of the profits and losses of ProGold and received 50% of any cash that is distributed to ProGolds members. 
 Under the Operating Agreement, ProGolds board of governors is comprised of six members (each, a Governor), with three members appointed by each of the Cooperative and Cargill. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Governors is required to, among other actions, approve capital projects in excess of $1 million, approve infrastructure projects, approve any changes to current and future leases, and appoint one or more managers of ProGold. In addition to the affirmative vote of a majority of the Governors, certain fundamental actions, such as a merger or consolidation, sale or liquidation of substantially all of the assets of ProGold, a dissolution of ProGold, the approval of new members, or the approval of loans to ProGold by members requires the unanimous approval of the members. Neither the Cooperative nor Cargill may sell or transfer its interest in ProGold to any third party without the other partys consent. Additionally, each party has a right of first refusal to purchase the others interest in ProGold if such party receives an offer for or desires to sell its interest.

In the event any Cargill Competitor (as defined in the Operating Agreement) acquires an equity interest in the Cooperative, Cargill will have a sixty-day option to purchase all of the membership interest in ProGold held by the Cooperative for a purchase price of $81 million plus 50% of the remaining lease payments due under the Facility Lease through the closing date of such sale. Further, if a Triggering Event (as defined in the Operating Agreement) occurs, the Cooperative and Cargill will expeditiously and in good faith work together to finalize a joint venture agreement for the structure, governance and operation of ProGold according to certain operating principles and other guideline terms. If a joint venture agreement is agreed to, the Cooperative will reimburse Cargill for 50% of the undepreciated capital expense associated with approved projects. If the Cooperative and Cargill are unable to agree on terms for a joint venture agreement, Cargill agrees to purchase the Cooperatives 50% interest in ProGold for $81 million and half of any remaining lease payments due through December 31, 2026.
 Also in connection with the Option exercise, ProGold and Cargill entered into that certain First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Facility Lease, effective March 1, 2022, extending the term of the Facility Lease through December 31, 2026. Under the terms of the amended Facility Lease, Cargill paid ProGold an annual lease payment of $15.5 million in 2021 and 2022, will pay an annual lease payment of $15.5 million in 2023, and $16 million in 2024 through 2026. Cargill also agreed to pay the Cooperative $1.29 million at closing as an early buyout of previously committed and deployed capital projects. 
 The wet-milling facility was built in 1995. As processing facilities age, more extensive maintenance becomes necessary to keep the facility in good working order. During the term of the Facility Lease, Cargill will deploy capital for several approved projects estimated at $25 million. Cargill will have a leasehold interest in these capital projects and will receive the benefit of depreciation during the term of the Facility Lease. Additionally, ProGold agreed to pay at least $750,000 in 2022 and 2023, and $500,000 in 2024 through 2026, for infrastructure maintenance and may also be required to pay additional sums in order to make certain capital improvements. The payments will reduce any income available for ProGolds members at the time of such expenses. The Cooperative and Cargill would experience any such reduction in ProGolds income proportionately based on their percentage ownership of ProGold. 
 Membership and Delivery Obligations 
 Annually, the Cooperative is required to deliver approximately 15,490,480 bushels of corn to Cargill for processing at the ProGold facility. The Cooperatives members deliver corn to the ProGold facility on the Cooperatives behalf to meet this delivery obligation. 
 Any person residing in the United States can own Units in the Cooperative as long as that person delivers or provides for the delivery of corn for processing at the ProGold facility. Ownership of our Units requires our members to deliver corn to the Cooperative in proportion to the number of Units each member holds. Currently 15,490,480 Units are issued and outstanding. The Cooperatives income and losses are allocated to our members based on the volume of corn a member delivers or has delivered. Subject to certain limitations, as long as a member patronizes the Cooperative by delivering corn in proportion to the number of Units held by the member, the member will be allocated a corresponding portion of our income (or loss). In this way, we operate on a cooperative basis. 
 To hold our Units a member is required to execute a Uniform Member Agreement that obligates the member to deliver corn to us and an Annual Delivery Agreement by which each member annually elects the members method to deliver corn  either Method A or Method B, or a combination of both. Under Method A, a member is required to physically deliver the required bushels of corn to us either at the ProGold facility or another location designated by the Cooperative. Under Method B, a member appoints us as its agent to arrange for the acquisition and delivery of the required bushels of corn on the members behalf. 
 In order to provide delivery services to our members in the most cost-effective manner, the Cooperative has entered into an agreement with Cargill whereby we appoint Cargill as our agent to arrange for the delivery of the corn by our members who elect to deliver corn using Method A, and we appoint Cargill as our agent to acquire corn on our behalf for our members who elect to deliver corn using Method B. If a member elects to deliver corn using Method B, the price per bushel the Cooperative pays to the member is equal to the price per bushel paid by Cargill to acquire the corn as our agent. The Cooperative pays members who deliver corn under Method A the market price or contracted price for their corn at the time of delivery. Members who deliver corn under Method A also receive from the Cooperative an incentive payment of $.05 per bushel on the corn that they deliver, while members who elect Method B to deliver corn pay to the Cooperative a $.02 per bushel agency fee for the cost of having us deliver corn on their behalf. The incentive payment for Method A deliveries and the agency fee for Method B deliveries are subject to annual adjustment at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. While the Cooperative is financially responsible for the various payments to the members for corn, Cargill, serving as the Cooperatives administrative agent, issues payments to members for corn on the Cooperatives behalf.

Annually, we notify Cargill of the number of bushels of Method A corn to be delivered by each member who has elected to deliver corn by Method A. Once we provide notification to Cargill of the number of bushels of corn, Cargill then confirms the amount of corn with each member and notifies that member with respect to quality specifications, allowances, deductions and premiums to be applicable to that corn. The member with a Method A corn commitment then directly contracts with Cargill for corn delivered by Method A. At the end of each month Cargill reports the number of Method A bushels delivered and the average daily price paid for corn that Cargill purchased from members on the Cooperatives behalf. The product of the number of bushels delivered multiplied by the average monthly market price is reported as Method A corn expense. In the event a member who has elected to deliver corn by Method A delivers to Cargill more than its delivery commitment, any corn delivered in excess of that commitment is handled as a direct sale of corn to Cargill. In the event a member who has elected to deliver corn by Method A delivers to Cargill less than its committed amount of corn, the quantity of the shortfall is then purchased and delivered by Cargill on our behalf. The purchase price is equal to the average price reported for Method A corn for the final month of the year. In addition, the Method A member with a shortfall will be charged a purchased corn fee and agency fee determined by the Board of Directors. 
 Cargill purchases the remainder of the corn to be delivered by us on behalf of our Method B delivering members at such time and in such quantities as it deems appropriate and in the best interest of the Cooperative and Cargill. Each quarter, the Cooperative notifies Cargill of the number of Method B bushels to be purchased during the quarter. Cargill will certify to the Cooperative that it has purchased the necessary Method B bushels. The price paid is reported as the Method B corn revenue, calculated by multiplying the weighted average price for Method A corn delivered during the quarter by the number of Method B bushels delivered during the quarter.
 In exchange for the services set forth above with respect to handling our members delivery of corn to the wet-milling facility, we paid Cargill an annual fee of $60,000 in 2022. This fee was paid in quarterly installments. In addition, we also pay Cargill a per-bushel fee if a Method A member fails to deliver corn. This amount is in addition to any reimbursement we are required to pay Cargill for a Method A members failure to deliver. All of our agreements with Cargill terminate at the expiration of the Facility Lease between Cargill and ProGold.
 Allocation of Income and/or Losses 
 When members deliver corn to the Cooperative for processing at the facility, they are paid a market price for the corn that is delivered. In addition, members have a right to receive added value for the efforts in the form of patronage based on each members proportionate share of the Cooperatives income from ProGold that is derived primarily from Cargills lease of the facility. 
 Our Third Amended and Restated Bylaws (Bylaws) establish a Method A delivery pool and a Method B delivery pool. Generally, our income and/or losses are allocated annually based on the percentage of bushels of corn our members elect to deliver using either Method A or Method B. Regardless of the actual percentage allocation between our members who deliver bushels of corn using Method A or Method B, our Bylaws require us to annually allocate at least 25% of our income and/or losses to the Method A pool. The amount of our income and/or losses actually allocated to the Method A pool is a percentage equal to the greater of 25% or the actual percentage of bushels of corn delivered by our members using Method A. 
 If less than 25% of the bushels of corn are delivered by members using Method A, the members who elect Method A will be allocated 25% of our income and/or losses even though they deliver less than 25% of the bushels of corn obligated to be delivered by us to Cargill. As a result of this requirement, a Method A member may receive a greater proportionate allocation of our income and/or losses than a Method B member who contracted to have the same amount of corn delivered.
 4 

For each of the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years, our members elected to and delivered 27% of the bushels of corn by Method A and 73% of the bushels of corn by Method B. For each year, this resulted in 27% of our income and/or losses and 27% of any cash distributions being allocated to the Method A pool. This reflects the actual percentage of members who elected to deliver corn using Method A and does not result in reallocation to meet the 25% requirement set forth in our governing documents. 
 Government Regulations and Environmental Compliance
The Cooperative does not anticipate any material effects of governmental regulations on its business. To the extent government regulations, including environmental regulations, require certain capital improvements to the ProGold facility, ProGold may be required to pay for such improvements. The payments would reduce any income available for the Cooperative, as a member of ProGold, at the times of such expenses. We do not expect that the cost of complying with these regulations will have a material impact on our distribution from ProGold for the current fiscal year. 
 Employees
As of December 31, 2022, the Cooperative had 1 full-time employee, Executive Vice President, Scott Stofferahn, who serves in the capacity of chief executive officer and chief financial officer. 
 Competition
As a grower-owned cooperative whose members are contractually obligated to deliver corn, the Cooperative generally does not face competition in the marketplace for corn. More importantly, its governing documents and contractual arrangements with Cargill contain contractual incentives for growers to deliver corn to the Cooperative and not to another processor. Even if members do not fully satisfy their delivery commitments, there are sufficient supplies of corn to be purchased in the open market to meet any contract obligations to Cargill, with any costs to be charged to the defaulting member. 
 The Cooperative was formed in 1994 by a group of corn growers with a goal of adding value to the corn they delivered for processing. Members invested in the Cooperative with the goal of creating a facility where they could not only find a certain market for their corn but where they could also benefit from a long term investment in a value added enterprise such as the ProGold facility. There is no competition in attracting members to the Cooperative and its services. Other grain shippers and corn processing facilities in the region provide competition for the purchase of corn from members, but most do not provide the opportunity for membership or partial ownership and any resulting additional profits from the operation or lease of their facilities.
