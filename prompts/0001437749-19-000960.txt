General 
 
Bassett is a leading retailer, manufacturer and marketer of branded home furnishings. Our products are sold primarily through a network of Company-owned and licensee-owned branded stores under the Bassett Home Furnishings (“BHF”) name, with additional distribution through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers. We were founded in 1902 and incorporated under the laws of Virginia in 1930. Our rich 116-year history has instilled the principles of quality, value, and integrity in everything we do, while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever-changing consumer tastes and meet the demands of a global economy.
 
With 97 BHF stores at November 24, 2018 we have leveraged our strong brand name in furniture into a network of Company-owned and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly environment for buying furniture and accessories.  Our store program is designed to provide a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish, quality furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service.  In order to reach markets that cannot be effectively served by our retail store network, we also distribute our products through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers. We use a network of over 30 independent sales representatives who have stated geographical territories. These sales representatives are compensated based on a standard commission rate. We believe this blended strategy provides us the greatest ability to effectively distribute our products throughout the United States and ultimately gain market share.  
 
The BHF stores feature custom order furniture, free in-home design visits (“home makeovers”), and coordinated decorating accessories.  Our philosophy is based on building strong long-term relationships with each customer.  Sales people are referred to as “Design Consultants” and are trained to evaluate customer needs and provide comprehensive solutions for their home decor.  Until a rigorous training and design certification program is completed, Design Consultants are not authorized to perform in-home design services for our customers.
 
We have factories in Newton, North Carolina and Grand Prairie, Texas that manufacture custom upholstered furniture, a factory in Martinsville, Virginia that primarily assembles and finishes our custom casual dining offerings and a factory in Bassett, Virginia that assembles and finishes our “Bench Made” line of custom, solid hardwood furniture. Our manufacturing team takes great pride in the breadth of its options, the precision of its craftsmanship, and the speed of its process, with custom pieces often manufactured within two weeks of taking the order in our stores. Our logistics team then promptly ships the product to one of our home delivery hubs or to a location specified by our licensees.  In addition to the furniture that we manufacture domestically, we source most of our formal bedroom and dining room furniture (casegoods) and certain leather upholstery offerings from several foreign plants, primarily in Vietnam and China. However, over 70% of the products we currently sell are manufactured in the United States.
 
We also own Zenith Freight Lines, LLC (“Zenith”) which provides logistical services to Bassett along with other furniture manufacturers and retailers. Zenith delivers best-of-class shipping and logistical support services that are uniquely tailored to the needs of Bassett and the furniture industry. Approximately 65% of Zenith’s revenue is generated from services provided to non-Bassett customers.
 
On December 21, 2017, we purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Lane Venture from Heritage Home Group, LLC for $15,556 in cash. Lane Venture is a manufacturer and distributor of premium outdoor furniture, and is now being operated as a component of our wholesale segment. This acquisition marks our entry into the market for outdoor furniture and we believe that Lane Venture will provide a foundation for us to become a significant participant in this category. We distribute this brand outside of our BHF store network with plans to introduce a Bassett-branded line in the BHF stores in 2020. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding this acquisition.

Operating Segments 
 
We have strategically aligned our business into three reportable segments: Wholesale, Retail – Company-owned stores, and Logistical Services.
 
The wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design, manufacture, sourcing, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of BHF stores (Company-owned retail stores and licensee-owned stores) and independent furniture retailers. Our retail segment consists of 65 Company-owned and operated BHF stores. The following table shows the number of Company-owned stores by state as of November 24, 2018:

 | Number of | | | | Number of
--------------+-----------+---+-------+----------------+----------
State | Stores | | State | | Stores 
Alabama | | 1 | | Missouri | | 1 
Arizona | | 2 | | Nevada | | 1 
Arkansas | | 1 | | New Jersey | | 1 
California | | 5 | | New York | | 6 
Connecticut | | 3 | | North Carolina | | 5 
Delaware | | 1 | | Ohio | | 1 
Florida | | 3 | | Oklahoma | | 1 
Georgia | | 3 | | Pennsylvania | | 2 
Kansas | | 1 | | South Carolina | | 1 
Kentucky | | 1 | | Tennessee | | 1 
Maryland | | 3 | | Texas | | 12
Massachusetts | | 3 | | Virginia | | 5 
Mississippi | | 1 | | Total | | 65

 
Our six locations in the state of New York include a 16,000 square foot clearance center in Middletown, New York which we opened during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Unlike our other 64 BHF locations, the clearance center offers only clearance merchandise at reduced price points and without design consulting services.
 
With our acquisition of Zenith in 2015, we created the logistical services operating segment which reflects the operations of Zenith. In addition to providing shipping and warehousing services for the Company, Zenith also provides similar services to other customers, primarily in the furniture industry.
 

Wholesale Segment Overview
 
The wholesale furniture industry is very competitive and there are a large number of manufacturers both within and outside the United States who compete in the market on the basis of product quality, price, style, delivery and service. Additionally, many retailers source imported product directly, thus bypassing domestic furniture manufacturers and wholesale importers. We believe that we can be successful in the current competitive environment because our products represent excellent value combining attractive prices, quality and styling, prompt delivery, and superior service.
 
Wholesale shipments by category for the last three fiscal years are summarized below:
 

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
--------------------------+------+---------+------+-------+-----
Bassett Custom Upholstery | $ | 141,321 | | 55.2 | % | $ | 136,366 | 54.7 | % | $ | 127,989 | 53.3 | %
Bassett Leather | | 21,589 | | 8.4 | % | | 22,528 | 9.0 | % | | 21,038 | 8.8 | %
Bassett Custom Wood | | 46,074 | | 18.0 | % | | 43,793 | 17.6 | % | | 36,517 | 15.2 | %
Bassett Casegoods | | 42,875 | | 16.8 | % | | 42,874 | 17.2 | % | | 52,246 | 21.7 | %
Accessories | | 4,099 | | 1.6 | % | | 3,632 | 1.5 | % | | 2,556 | 1.1 | %
Total | $ | 255,958 | | 100.0 | % | $ | 249,193 | 100.0 | % | $ | 240,346 | 100.0 | %

 
Approximately 27% of our 2018 wholesale sales were of imported product compared to 27% and 31% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We define imported product as fully finished product that is sourced. Our domestic product includes certain products that contain components which were also sourced. We continue to believe that a blended strategy including domestically produced products primarily of a custom-order nature combined with sourcing of major collections provides the best value and quality of products to our customers. The decline in imported goods share of our wholesale sales over the last three years has been driven primarily by increasing sales of our domestic custom wood and upholstery product offerings.

The dollar value of our wholesale backlog, representing orders received but not yet shipped to the BHF store network or independent dealers, was $25,810 at November 24, 2018 and $22,239 at November 25, 2017. We expect that the November 24, 2018 backlog will be filled within fiscal 2019, with the majority of the backlog being filled during the first quarter.
 
We use lumber, fabric, leather, foam and other materials in the production of wood and upholstered furniture. These components are purchased from a variety of domestic and international suppliers and are widely available. The price and availability of foam, which is highly dependent on the cost of oil and available capacity of oil refineries, can be subject to significant volatility from time to time. We currently assemble and finish these components in our four plants in the United States.
 
Other Investments and Real Estate
 
Our balance sheet at November 24, 2018 and November 25, 2017 included short-term investments in certificates of deposit and certain retail real estate related to former licensee-owned stores. The impact upon earnings arising from these assets is included in other loss, net, in our consolidated statements of income. Our investment balances at each of the last three fiscal year-ends are as follows:

 | November 24, | | November 25, | | | November 26,
---------------------------------------+--------------+--------+--------------+---+--------+-------------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016 
Investments in certificates of deposit | $ | 22,643 | | $ | 23,125 | | $ | 23,125
Certain retail real estate | | 1,655 | | | 2,969 | | | 3,120 

 
Our short-term investments at November 24, 2018 consist of certificates of deposit (“CDs”) with original terms generally ranging from six to twelve months, bearing interest at rates ranging from 0.85% to 2.70% with a weighted average yield of approximately 2.3%. At November 24, 2018, the weighted average remaining time to maturity of the CDs was approximately six months. Each CD is placed with a federally insured financial institution and all deposits are within Federal deposit insurance limits.
 
We hold investments in retail store properties that we had previously leased to licensees. These holdings, which also include closed store real estate currently leased to non-licensees, are included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. These real estate holdings are typically in urban, high-traffic retail locations. See Item 2, Properties, for additional information about our retail real estate holdings.
 

Retail Segment Overview – Company-Owned Retail Stores
 
The retail furniture industry remains very competitive and includes local furniture stores, regional furniture retailers, national department and chain stores and single-vendor branded retailers. As a whole, our store network with 65 Company-owned stores and 32 licensee-owned stores, ranks in the top 30 in retail furniture sales in the United States. We plan to open six additional Company-owned stores in fiscal 2019, after which we expect to significantly reduce the pace of the BHF network expansion and focus on maximizing profitable sales volume through the existing stores.
 
Net sales for our Company-owned retail stores for the last three fiscal years are summarized below:
 

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016
----------+------+---------+------+---+---------+-----
Net sales | $ | 268,883 | | $ | 268,264 | | $ | 254,667

 
Maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to our ability to expand our base of customers and drive increased traffic at both Company-owned and licensee-owned stores. Our advertising and marketing campaign utilizes local and national television, direct mail, catalogs, newspapers, magazines, radio, internet and social and other digital media in an effort to maintain and enhance our existing brand equity.
 
Our stores incorporate a stylish, residential feel while highlighting our unmatched custom manufacturing capabilities.  We leverage our customization capabilities by dedicating space in the stores to design solutions for dining, upholstery, home entertainment and storage.

Tractors | | 154 | | 88 | | 242
Trailers | | 239 | | 271 | | 510

We own a central warehousing and national distribution hub located in Conover, North Carolina, and we lease nine facilities in seven states across the continental United States from which we operate regional freight terminals and provide warehouse and distribution services.
 
Trademarks 
 
Our trademarks, including “Bassett” and the names of some of our marketing divisions, products and collections, are significant to the conduct of our business. This is important due to consumer recognition of the names and identification with our broad range of products. Certain of our trademarks are licensed to independent retailers for use in full store and store gallery presentations of our products. We also own copyrights that are important in the conduct of our business.
Government Regulations 
 
We believe that we have materially complied with all federal, state and local standards regarding safety, health and pollution and environmental controls.
 
Our logistical services segment is also subject to regulation by several federal governmental agencies, including the Department of Transportation (“DOT”). Specifically the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the Surface Transportation Board, which are agencies within the DOT. We are also subject to rules and regulations of various state agencies. These regulatory authorities have broad powers, generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations, motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers and other matters.
 
We may also be affected by laws and regulations of countries from which we source goods. Labor, environmental and other laws and regulations change over time, especially in the developing countries from which we source. Changes in these areas of regulation could negatively impact the cost and availability of sourced goods. The timing and extent to which these regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations is difficult to predict. In addition, the imposition of new or increased duties, tariffs, retaliatory tariffs and trade limitations with respect to foreign-sourced products could negatively impact the cost of such goods. Based on the present facts, we do not believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations.
 
People 
 
We employed 2,574 people as of November 24, 2018, of which 934 were employed in our retail segment, 1,034 were employed in our wholesale segment and 606 were employed in our logistical services segment, which also utilized another 161 temporary workers provided through staffing agencies. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining arrangements and we have not experienced any recent work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Major Customers
 
Our risk exposure related to our customers, consisting primarily of trade accounts receivable along with certain guarantees, net of recognized reserves, totaled approximately $21,050 and $22,357 at November 24, 2018 and November 25, 2017, respectively. At November 24, 2018 and November 25, 2017, approximately 33% and 29%, respectively, of the aggregate risk exposure, net of reserves, was attributable to five customers. In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated net sales. However, two customers accounted for approximately 40%, 47% and 46% of our consolidated revenue from logistical services during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
