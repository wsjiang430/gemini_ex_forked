Item 1. Business
Corporate History:
We were formed as a Nevada corporation on May 14, 2008. Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 19, 2008, by and between Vertex Holdings, L.P. (formerly Vertex Energy, L.P.), a Texas limited partnership (“Holdings”), us, World Waste Technologies, Inc., a California corporation (“WWT” or “World Waste”), Vertex Merger Sub, LLC, a California limited liability company and our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Subsidiary”), and Benjamin P. Cowart, our Chief Executive Officer, as agent for our shareholders (as amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”). Effective on April 16, 2009, World Waste merged with and into Merger Subsidiary, with Merger Subsidiary continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, (i) each outstanding share of World Waste common stock was cancelled and exchanged for 0.10 shares of our common stock; (ii) each outstanding share of World Waste Series A preferred stock was cancelled and exchanged for 0.4062 shares of our Series A preferred stock; and (iii) each outstanding share of World Waste Series B preferred stock was cancelled and exchanged for 11.651 shares of our Series A preferred stock.
Additionally, as a result of the Merger, as the successor entity of World Waste, we assumed World Waste’s filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our common stock began trading on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol “VTNR.OB” effective May 4, 2009. Subsequently, effective February 13, 2013, our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “VTNR”. 
Prior Material Acquisitions
Effective as of August 31, 2012, we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Vertex Acquisition Sub, LLC (“Acquisition Sub”), a special purpose entity consisting of substantially all of the assets of Holdings and real-estate properties of B & S Cowart Family L.P. (“B&S LP” and the “Acquisition”). Prior to closing the Acquisition, Holdings contributed to Acquisition Sub substantially all of its assets and liabilities relating to the business of transporting, storing, processing and re-refining petroleum products, crudes and used lubricants, including all of the outstanding equity interests in Holdings’ wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, Cedar Marine Terminals, L.P. (“CMT” or "Cedar Marine Terminals"), which operates a 19-acre bulk liquid storage facility and terminal on the Houston Ship Channel, which serves as a truck-in, barge-out facility and provides throughput terminal operations and which terminal is also the site of our proprietary, patented, Thermal Chemical Extraction Process ("TCEP") (described below); Crossroad Carriers, L.P. (“Crossroad”) is a common carrier that provides transportation and logistical services for liquid petroleum products, as well as other hazardous materials and product streams; Vertex Recovery, L.P. (“Vertex Recovery”), a generator solutions company for the recycling and collection of used oil and oil-related residual materials from large regional and national customers throughout the U.S. and Canada, which it facilitates through a network of independent recyclers and franchise collectors; and H&H Oil, L.P. (“H&H Oil”), which collects and recycles used oil and residual materials from customers based in Austin, Baytown, Dallas, San Antonio and Corpus Christi, Texas and B&S LP contributed real estate associated with the operations of H&H Oil.
Benjamin P. Cowart, our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chairman and largest shareholder directly or indirectly owned a 77% interest in Holdings and a 100% interest in B&S LP at the time of the acquisition. Additionally, Chris Carlson, our Chief Financial Officer, owned a 10% interest in Holdings at the time of the acquisition.
In October, 2013, January 2014 and September 2014, we completed various transactions whereby we acquired 100% of E-Source Holdings, LLC (“E-Source”), a company that leased and operated a facility located in Houston, Texas, and provides dismantling, demolition, decommission and marine salvage services at industrial facilities throughout the Gulf Coast. E-Source also owns and operates a fleet of trucks and other vehicles used for shipping and handling equipment and scrap materials. E-Source falls under our Recovery segment. At December 31, 2018, E-Source is no longer in operations and we no longer undertake dismantling, demolition, decommission and marine salvage services.
In May, 2014, we acquired certain of the assets of Omega Refining, LLC (“Omega Refining”), Bango Refining NV, LLC (“Bango Refining”) and Omega Holdings Company LLC (“Omega Holdings” and collectively with Omega Refining and Bango Refining, “Omega” or the “sellers”) related to (1) the operation of oil re-refineries and, in connection therewith, purchasing used lubricating oils and re-refining such oils into processed oils and other products for the distribution, supply and sale to end-customers and (2) the provision of related products and support services. Specifically, the assets included Omega’s Marrero, Louisiana plant which produces vacuum gas oil (VGO) and a Bango, Nevada plant which produces base lubricating oils. Omega also operated Golden State Lubricants Works, LLC (“Golden State”), a strategic blending and storage facility located in Bakersfield, California, which we acquired in the acquisition and have since ceased operations. In connection with the acquisition, we also acquired certain of Omega's prepaid assets and inventory. We acquired the assets in the name of our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Vertex 
1

Refining LA, LLC. The assets and operations acquired from Omega fall under our Black Oil segment. Bango Refining operations were sold in January 2016.
In December, 2014, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Warren Ohio Holdings Co., LLC, f/k/a Heartland Group Holdings, LLC (“Heartland”) related to and used in an oil re-refinery and, in connection with the collecting, aggregating and purchasing of used lubricating oils and the re-refining of such oils into processed oils and other products for the distribution, supply and sale to end-customers, including raw materials, finished products and work-in-process, equipment and other fixed assets, customer lists and marketing information, the name ‘Heartland’ and other related trade names, Heartland’s real property relating to its used oil refining facility located in Columbus, Ohio, used oil storage and transfer facilities located in Columbus, Zanesville and Norwalk, Ohio, and leases related to storage and transfer facilities located in Zanesville, Ohio, Mount Sterling, Kentucky, and Ravenswood, West Virginia (collectively, the “Heartland Assets”). The Heartland Assets were acquired by our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Vertex Refining OH, LLC ("Vertex OH"). The assets and operations acquired from Heartland fall under our Black Oil segment.
In August 2015, H&H Oil acquired a collection route consisting of collecting, shipping and selling used oil, oil filters, antifreeze and other related services in the state of Louisiana, but excluding industrial customers, maritime customers, off shore customers, dockside locations, industrial services, used absorbent services, wastewater generating customers and collectors/transporters of crankcase used oil, petroleum fuel reclamation customers and crude oil producers/processing/recovery/reclamation customers of Aaron Oil Company ("Aaron Oil"). Included in the purchase were certain trucks and other assets owned by Aaron Oil and certain contract rights. The assets and operations acquired from H&H Oil fall under our Black Oil segment.
Description of Business Activities:
We are an environmental services company that recycles industrial waste streams and off-specification commercial chemical products. Our primary focus is recycling used motor oil and other petroleum by-products. We are engaged in operations across the entire petroleum recycling value chain including collection, aggregation, transportation, storage, re-refinement, and sales of aggregated feedstock and re-refined products to end users. We operate in three segments (1) Black Oil, (2) Refining and Marketing, and (3) Recovery. 
We currently provide our services in 15 states, primarily in the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. For the rolling twelve month period ending December 31, 2018, we aggregated approximately 103 million gallons of used motor oil and other petroleum by-product feedstocks and managed the re-refining of approximately 76 million gallons of used motor oil with our proprietary TCEP, VGO and Base Oil processes.
Our Black Oil segment collects and purchases used motor oil directly from third-party generators, aggregates used motor oil from an established network of local and regional collectors, and sells used motor oil to our customers for use as a feedstock or replacement fuel for industrial burners. We operate a refining facility that uses our proprietary TCEP (which is being used to pre-treat our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping them to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana, instead of its original purposes, to re-fine used oil into marine cutterstock, as such use is not currently economically accretive) and we also utilize third-party processing facilities. We also operate a facility in Marrero, Louisiana, which facility re-refines used motor oil and also produces VGO and a re-refining complex in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, which we call our Myrtle Grove facility.
Our Refining and Marketing segment aggregates and manages the re-refinement of used motor oil and other petroleum by-products and sells the re-refined products to end customers. 
Our Recovery segment includes a generator solutions company for the proper recovery and management of hydrocarbon streams as well as metals. 
Black Oil Segment
Our Black Oil segment is engaged in operations across the entire used motor oil recycling value chain including collection, aggregation, transportation, storage, refinement, and sales of aggregated feedstock and re-refined products to end users. We collect and purchase used oil directly from generators such as oil change service stations, automotive repair shops, manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries, and petrochemical manufacturing operations. We own a fleet of 35 collection vehicles, which routinely visit generators to collect and purchase used motor oil. We also aggregate used oil from a diverse network of approximately 50 suppliers who operate similar collection businesses to ours.
2

We manage the logistics of transport, storage and delivery of used oil to our customers. We own a fleet of 15 transportation trucks and more than 150 aboveground storage tanks with over 7.3 million gallons of storage capacity. These assets are used by both the Black Oil segment and the Refining and Marketing segment. In addition, we also utilize third parties for the transportation and storage of used oil feedstocks. Typically, we sell used oil to our customers in bulk to ensure efficient delivery by truck, rail, or barge. In many cases, we have contractual purchase and sale agreements with our suppliers and customers, respectively. We believe these contracts are beneficial to all parties involved because it ensures that a minimum volume is purchased from collectors and generators, a minimum volume is sold to our customers, and we are able to minimize our inventory risk by a spread between the costs to acquire used oil and the revenues received from the sale and delivery of used oil. We also have historically used our proprietary TCEP technology to re-refine used oil into marine fuel cutterstock and a higher-value feedstock for further processing (we are currently utilizing TCEP to pre-treat our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping them to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana; but have not operated our TCEP for the purpose of producing finished cutterstock since the third quarter of fiscal 2015, due to market conditions). In addition, at our Marrero, Louisiana facility we produce a Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO) product that is sold to refineries as well as to the marine fuels market. At our Columbus, Ohio facility (Heartland Petroleum) we produce a base oil product that is sold to lubricant packagers and distributors.
Refining and Marketing Segment
Our Refining and Marketing segment is engaged in the aggregation of feedstock, re-refining it into higher value end products, and selling these products to our customers, as well as related transportation and storage activities. We aggregate a diverse mix of feedstocks including used motor oil, petroleum distillates, transmix and other off-specification chemical products. These feedstock streams are purchased from pipeline operators, refineries, chemical processing facilities and third-party providers, and are also transferred from our Black Oil segment. We have a toll-based processing agreement in place with KMTEX to re-refine feedstock streams, under our direction, into various end products that we specify. KMTEX uses industry standard processing technologies to re-refine our feedstocks into pygas, gasoline blendstock and marine fuel cutterstock. We sell all of our re-refined products directly to end-customers or to processing facilities for further refinement.
Recovery Segment
The Recovery segment is a generator solutions company for the proper recovery and management of hydrocarbon streams. The Company (through this segment) owns and operates a fleet of thirteen trucks and heavy equipment used for processing, shipping and handling of reusable process equipment and other scrap commodities.
Thermal Chemical Extraction Process
We own the intellectual property for our patented TCEP. TCEP is a technology which utilizes thermal and chemical dynamics to extract impurities from used oil which increases the value of the feedstock. We intend to continue to develop our TCEP technology and design with the goal of producing additional re-refined products, including lubricating base oil.
TCEP differs from conventional re-refining technologies, such as vacuum distillation and hydrotreatment, by relying more heavily on chemical processes to remove impurities rather than temperature and pressure. Therefore, the capital requirements to build a TCEP plant are typically much less than a traditional re-refinery because large feed heaters, vacuum distillation columns, and a hydrotreating unit are not required. The end product currently produced by TCEP is used as fuel oil cutterstock. Conventional re-refineries produce lubricating base oils or product grades slightly lower than base oil that can be used as industrial fuels or transportation fuel blendstocks.
We currently estimate the cost to construct a new, fully-functional, commercial facility using our TCEP technology, with annual processing capacity of between 25 and 50 million gallons at another location would be approximately $10 - $15 million, which could fluctuate based on throughput capacity. The facility infrastructure would require additional capitalized expenditures which would depend on the location and site specifics of the facility. We are currently utilizing TCEP to pre-treat our used motor oil feedstocks prior to shipping them to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana; but have not operated our TCEP for the purpose of producing finished cutterstock since the third quarter of fiscal 2015, due to market conditions. As such, we have no current plans to construct any other TCEP facilities at this time.
Organizational Structure
The following chart reflects our current organization structure, including significant subsidiaries (all of which are wholly-owned, except as discussed below):

Our Industry
The used oil recycling industry is comprised of multiple participants including generators, collectors, aggregators, processors, and end users. Generators are entities that generate used oil through their daily operations such as automotive businesses conducting oil changes on consumer and commercial vehicles and industrial users changing lubricants on machinery and heavy equipment. Collectors are typically local businesses that purchase used oil from generators and provide on-site collection services. The collection market is highly fragmented and we believe there are more than 400 used oil collectors in the United States. Aggregators are specialized businesses that purchase used oil and petroleum by-products from multiple collectors and sell and deliver it as feedstock to processors. Processors, or re-refineries, utilize a processing technology to convert the used oil or petroleum by-product into a higher-value feedstock or end-product. Used oil is any oil that has been refined from crude oil or any synthetic oil that has been used and, as a result of such use, is contaminated by physical or chemical impurities. Physical impurities could include contamination by metal shavings, sawdust, or dirt. Chemical impurities could include contamination by water or benzene, or degradation of lubricating additives.
Conventional re-refineries typically employ vacuum distillation and hydrotreating processes to transform used oil into various grades of base oil. Vacuum distillation is a process that removes emulsified contaminated water and separates used oil into vacuum gas oil and light fuels. The vacuum gas oil is then hydrotreated to produce lubricating base oil. Hydrotreating is a process which combines chemical catalysts, heat, and pressure to remove impurities such as sulfur, chlorine, and oxygen and to stabilize the end product. A re-refined lubricating base oil is of equal quality and will last as long as a virgin base oil. In addition, other re-refining processes transform used oil into product grades slightly lower than base oil. These products, along with vacuum gas oil and the end product produced by TCEP, are commonly referred to as intermediate products and are used as industrial fuels or transportation fuel blendstocks.
The petroleum by-products industry is driven by the financial and environmental benefits of recycling, as well as by the amount of petroleum by-product generated each year. Used oil is typically used: (a) as an industrial burner oil, where the used oil is dewatered, filtered and demineralized for use in industrial burners; (b) as hydraulic oil; (c) as bitumen based products (for road surfacing and roofing); (d) as an additive in manufactured products; or (e) as a re-refined base oil for use as a lubricant, hydraulic or transformer oil - which is how the Company uses such used oil. The market value of recycled oil is based, in large part, on its end use. In general, the market price for used motor oil that is burned as an industrial fuel is driven by the cost of competing fuels, including natural gas, while the market value of re-refined used motor oil is driven by competing petroleum products. The extent to which the financial benefits of recycling used oil are realized is driven by operating efficiency in aggregating, storing and transporting used oil supply; the extent to which the used oil is re-refined; and the price spread between natural gas and crude oil.

In the U.S., we believe that of the approximately 1.3 billion gallons of used oil generated annually approximately 200 million gallons are improperly disposed (per the EPA), 200 - 250 million gallons are re-refined into lubricating base oils, 150 - 200 million gallons are re-refined into intermediate products with grades slightly lower than base oil, and 650 - 750 million gallons are burned as an industrial fuel source. We also believe that each year the U.S. generates 425 million used automotive oil filters containing 160,000 tons of iron units and 18 million gallons of oil (per data provided by the Steel Recycling Institute). We believe that the amount of used oil being re-refined into base oils and intermediate products in the U.S. will stay basically unchanged in 2018 as no additional re-refining capacity is scheduled to come on-line. As of the date of this Report, the approximate market price for used oil at the generator level is approximately $0.25 per gallon charge, the approximate market price of intermediate re-refined products ranges from $0.75 to $1.35 per gallon, and the approximate price for lubricating base oil ranges from $1.20 to $1.60 per gallon, representing a U.S. market size of approximately $1.0 - $1.5 billion for recycled oil.
As with the financial benefits of recycling used oil, the environmental benefits are also driven by its end use. Environmental regulations prohibit the disposal of used oil in sewers or landfills because used motor oil is insoluble and contains heavy metals and other contaminants that make it detrimental to the environment if improperly disposed; one gallon of used oil can contaminate up to 1 million gallons of fresh drinking water. Additionally, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, it takes 42 gallons of crude oil, but only 1 gallon of used oil, to produce 2.5 quarts of new, high-quality lubricating oil. Compared to burning used oil as an industrial fuel, re-refined oil significantly reduces the amount of toxic heavy metals and greenhouse gases and other pollutants introduced into the environment. In addition, the use of re-refined motor oil conserves petroleum that would have otherwise been refined into virgin base stock oil.
We believe that the used oil recycling market has significant growth potential through increasing the percentage of recycled oil that is re-refined rather than burned as a low cost industrial fuel. We believe that the financial and environmental benefits of re-refining used oil combined with consumer and commercial demand for high-quality, environmentally responsible products will drive growth in demand for re-refined oil and re-refining capacity in the United States. Furthermore, we believe that increasing consumer and industrial awareness of the environmental impact of improperly disposing used oil may drive additional market growth as approximately 200 million gallons of used oil generated each year are improperly disposed rather than recycled.
Used motor oil is burned by various users such as asphalt companies, paper mills and industrial facilities as an alternative to their base fuels, to offset operational costs. Therefore, the commercial price of used oil is typically slightly less than the base fuels for the burners. Similarly, re-refined oil is used as a substitute for various virgin petroleum-based products with pricing driven by the market price of crude oil. Since there is not an active marketplace for used and re-refined oil prices, we use the prices of natural gas and crude as benchmarks in our industry. Typically, the spread between crude and natural gas prices is an accurate proxy for the potential incremental value of re-refining used oil. 
Our Competitive Strengths
Large, Diversified Feedstock Supply Network.
We obtain our feedstock supply through a combination of direct collection activities and purchases from third-party suppliers. We believe our balanced direct and indirect approach to obtaining feedstock is highly advantageous because it enables us to maximize total supply and reduce our reliance on any single supplier and the risk of not fulfilling our minimum feedstock sale quotas. We collect feedstock directly from over 4,500 generators including oil change service stations, automotive repair shops, manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries and petrochemical manufacturing operations, as well as brokers. We aggregate used oil from a diverse network of approximately 50 suppliers who operate similar collection businesses to ours. 
Strategic Relationships.
We have established relationships with key feedstock suppliers, storage and transportation providers, oil re-refineries, and end-user customers. We believe our relationships with these parties are strong, in part due to our high level of customer service, competitive prices, and our ability to contract (for purchase or sale) long-term, minimum monthly feedstock commitments. We believe that our strategic relationships could lead to contract extensions and expanded feedstock supply or purchase agreements.
Proprietary Technology.
Our proprietary TCEP technology produces a fuel oil cutterstock for the fuel oil market or a refining feedstock. We believe we are able to build TCEP re-refining facilities at a significantly lower cost than conventional re-refineries. We estimate the cost to build a TCEP plant with capacity of up to 50 million gallons at approximately $10 - $15 million, whereas a similar sized base 
5

oil plant with vacuum distillation towers and a hydrotreater can cost in excess of $50 million. Notwithstanding the lower cost of TCEP plants, with oil at its current prices, we do not believe that it makes economic sense to expand our TCEP technology at this time due to the fixed operating costs involved. 
Logistics Capabilities.
We have extensive expertise and experience managing and operating feedstock supply chain logistics and multimodal transportation services for customers who purchase our feedstock or higher-value, re-refined products. We believe that our scale, infrastructure, expertise, and contracts enable us to cost effectively transport product and consistently meet our customers’ volume, quality and delivery schedule requirements.
Scale of Operations.
We believe that the size and scale of our operations is a significant competitive advantage when competing for new business and maintaining existing customer relationships. Price is one of the main competitive factors in the feedstock collection industry and because we are able to effectively leverage our fixed operating costs and economies of scale, we believe that our prices are competitive. Through our network of suppliers and customers, we aggregate a large amount of feedstock, which enables us to enter into minimum purchase and sale contracts as well as accept large volume orders year-round. We believe this is a competitive advantage because it minimizes our suppliers’ inventory risk and ensures our customers’ minimum order volumes are satisfied. In addition, we believe our end customers prefer to work with an exclusive supplier rather than manage multiple customer relationships.
Diversified End Product Sales.
We believe that the diversity of the products we sell reduces our overall risk and exposure to price fluctuations. Prices for petroleum based products can be impacted significantly by supply and demand fluctuations which are not correlated with general commodity price changes. For instance, in a rising commodity price environment with a significant over-supply of base oil, the price of base oil may fall precipitously while the price of gasoline increases. We offer a diversified product mix consisting of used motor oil, fuel oil, pygas, and gasoline blendstock. We can also control our mix of end products by choosing to either resell collected feedstock or re-refine it into a higher-value product.
Management Team.
We are led by a management team with expertise in petroleum recycling, finance, operations, and re-refinement technology. Each member of our senior management team has more than 20 years of industry experience. We believe the strength of our management team will help our success in the marketplace.
Our Business Strategy
The principal elements of our strategy include:
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships
 We plan to grow market share by consolidating feedstock supply through partnering with or acquiring collection and aggregation assets. Our executive team has a proven ability to evaluate resource potential and identify acquisition targets. The acquisitions and/or partnerships could increase our revenue and provide better control over the quality and quantity of feedstock available for resale and/or upgrading as well as providing additional locations for the potential future implementation of TCEP (assuming market conditions improve). We also intend to diversify our revenue by acquiring complementary recycling service businesses, refining assets and technologies, and other vertically integrated businesses or assets. We believe we can realize synergies on acquisitions by leveraging our customer and vendor relationships, infrastructure, and personnel, and by eliminating duplicative overhead costs.
6

Expand Feedstock Supply Volume
We intend to expand our feedstock supply volume by growing our collection and aggregation operations. We plan to increase the volume of feedstock we collect directly by developing new relationships with generators and working to displace incumbent collectors; increasing the number of collection personnel, vehicles, equipment, and geographical areas we serve; and acquiring collectors in new or existing territories. We intend to increase the volume of feedstock we aggregate from third-party collectors by expanding our existing relationships and developing new vendor relationships. We believe that our ability to acquire large feedstock volumes will help to cultivate new vendor relationships because collectors often prefer to work with a single, reliable customer rather than manage multiple relationships and the uncertainty of excess inventory.
Broaden Existing Customer Relationships and Secure New Large Accounts
We intend to broaden our existing customer relationships by increasing sales of used motor oil and re-refined products to these accounts. In some cases, we may also seek to serve as our customers’ primary or exclusive supplier. We also believe that as we increase our supply of feedstock and re-refined products we will have the opportunity to secure larger customer accounts that require a partner who can consistently deliver high volumes.
Re-Refine Higher Value End Products
We intend to develop, lease, or acquire technologies to re-refine our feedstock supply into higher value end products, including assets or technologies which complement TCEP. Currently, we are using TCEP to pre-treat our used oil feedstock prior to sending it to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana for further processing; but have not operated our TCEP for the purpose of producing finished cutterstock since the third quarter of fiscal 2015, due to market conditions. We hope that continued improvements in our technologies and investments in additional technologies will enable us to upgrade feedstock into higher value end products, such as fuels and lubricating base oil that command higher market prices. 
Products and Services
We generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of six product categories. All of these products are commodities that are subject to various degrees of product quality and performance specifications. 
Used Motor Oil
Used motor oil is a petroleum-based or synthetic lubricant that contains impurities such as dirt, sand, water, and chemicals.
Fuel Oil
Fuel Oil is a distillate fuel which is typically blended with lower quality fuel oils. The distillation of used oil and other petroleum by-products creates a fuel with low viscosity, as well as low sulfur, ash, and heavy metal content, making it an ideal blending agent.
Pygas
Pygas, or pyrolysis gasoline, is a product that can be blended with gasoline as an octane booster or that can be distilled and separated into its components, including benzene and other hydrocarbons.
Gasoline Blendstock
Naphthas and various distillate products used for blending or compounding into finished motor gasoline. These components can include reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending (RBOB) but exclude oxygenates (alcohols and ethers), butane, and pentanes plus.
Base Oil
An oil to which other oils or substances are added to produce a lubricant. Typically the main substance in lubricants, base oils, are refined from crude oil.
Scrap Metal(s)
7

    Consists of recoverable ferrous and non-ferrous recyclable metals from manufacturing and consumption.  Scrap metal can be recovered from pipes, barges, boats, building supplies, surplus equipment, tanks, and other items consisting of metal composition.  These materials are segregated, processed, cut-up and sent back to a steel mill for re-purposing.
Suppliers
We conduct business with a number of used oil generators, as well as a large network of suppliers that collect used oil from used oil generators. In our capacity as a collector of used oil, we purchase feedstock from approximately 4,500 businesses, such as oil change service stations, automotive repair shops, manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries, and petrochemical manufacturing operations, which generate used oil through their operations.
In our capacity as a broker of used oil, we work with approximately 50 suppliers that collect used oil from businesses such as those mentioned above. 
Customers
The Black Oil segment sells used oil, VGO, base oil and other petroleum feedstocks to numerous customers in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States. The primary customers of its products are packagers, distributers, blenders and industrial burners, as described above as well as re-refiners of the feedstock. The Black Oil segment is party to various feedstock sale agreements whereby we sell used oil feedstock to third parties. The agreements provide for us to sell certain minimum gallons of used oil feedstock per month at a price per barrel equal to our direct costs, plus certain commissions, based on the quality and quantity of the used oil we supply.
The Recovery segment does not rely solely on contracts, but mainly on the spot market as well as a strategic network of customers and vendors to support the purchase and sale of its products which are commodities. It also relies on project based work which it bids on from time to time of which there is no guarantee or assurance of repeat business. 
KMTEX Tolling Agreement
On or around April 17, 2013, and effective June 1, 2012, we entered into a new Tolling Agreement with KMTEX, Ltd. (“KMTEX” and the agreement as amended to date, the “Tolling Agreement”). The Company was previously party to a tolling agreement with KMTEX which expired pursuant to its terms on June 30, 2010, provided that the parties had continued to operate under the terms of the expired agreement until their entry into the April 2013 Tolling Agreement.
Pursuant to the Tolling Agreement, KMTEX agreed to process feedstock of certain petroleum distillates, which we provide to KMTEX, into more valuable feedstocks, including pygas, gasoline blend stock and MDO/cutter stock. The Tolling Agreement had an expiration date of June 30, 2014 (the “Initial Term”), provided that if not terminated by either party by written notice to the other, received within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term (or any extension term), the agreement automatically renewed for a successive one (1) year period and could be automatically extended for up to five (5) more extension terms. 
In November 2013 and effective November 1, 2013, we entered into a First Amendment to Processing Agreement with KMTEX LLC (previously KMTEX Ltd., hereafter “KMTEX”), which amended the Tolling Agreement. The amendment formally extended the date of the initial term of the Tolling Agreement to December 31, 2015, provided that if not terminated by either party by written notice to the other, received within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the initial term, as amended (or any Extension Term, defined below), the agreement would automatically renew for a successive one (1) year period. The Tolling Agreement could be automatically extended for up to six (6) extension terms from the end of the extended initial term. The amendment also updated the pricing terms of the original agreement and required us to make certain capital expenditures at the KMTEX facility which have been made to date.
On December 3, 2015, and effective January 1, 2016, we entered into a Second Amendment to Processing Agreement with KMTEX. The amendment formally extended the date of the initial term of the Tolling Agreement to December 31, 2016, provided that if not terminated by either party by written notice to the other, received within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the initial term, as amended (or any extension term), the agreement automatically renews for a successive one (1) year period The amendment also updated the pricing terms of the agreement.
On December 14, 2016, and effective January 1, 2017, we entered into a Third Amendment to Processing Agreement with KMTEX. The amendment formally extended the date of the initial term of the Tolling Agreement to December 31, 2018, provided that if not terminated by either party by written notice to the other, received within ninety (90) days prior to the 
8

expiration of the initial term, as amended (or any Extension Term, defined below), the agreement automatically renews for a successive one (1) year period (an “Extension Term”). The Tolling Agreement can be automatically extended for up to six (6) Extension Terms from the end of the extended initial term. The amendment also updated the pricing terms of the agreement. As the Tolling Agreement, as amended, was not terminated by either party within 90 days of December 31, 2018, the term of the Tolling Agreement automatically extended for an additional one (1) year period through December 31, 2019, and such agreement can be extended for us to five (5) additional one (1) year extensions.
Notwithstanding the above, either party can terminate the Tolling Agreement at any time with ninety (90) days prior written notice for any reason and with thirty (30) days written notice upon the occurrence of certain material termination events as described in greater detail in the agreement. In connection with and pursuant to the Tolling Agreement, we pay KMTEX certain monthly tank rental fees, truck and rail car fees, and processing fees based on the weight of the material processed by KMTEX, as well as certain disposal fees and other fees. Each year of the agreement, beginning on the 12 month anniversary of the effective date, the parties agreed to review and increase the fees provided for in the agreement in accordance with among other things, various consumer price index benchmarks, as mutually agreed.
The Tolling Agreement also provides that, for materials delivered to KMTEX by rail, barge, drum, or truck, KMTEX is required to obtain the Bill of Lading and Material Safety Data Sheet that accompany such materials and not accept any materials not accompanied by a Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest (promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency or other Federal or State Government). The Company is also required to indemnify KMTEX against the acceptance of any material later classified as a hazardous waste. The agreement requires KMTEX to be responsible for all leaks, spills, discharges and releases which occur in connection with the performance of the agreement, except due to the Company’s gross negligence. Finally, the agreement requires each party to indemnify the other against any liability as a result of death or bodily injury to any person, destruction or damage to property, contamination of, adverse effects on, or imminent or substantial endangerment of, or release or threat of release into the environment, or any threatened or actual release of hazardous substance, or any violation or alleged violation of or liability under any governmental laws, regulations, rules or orders to the extent caused by, arising out of or in any manner connected with such indemnifying party’s negligent acts, omissions, breaches of the agreement or failure to comply with applicable laws in the performance thereof, subject to certain exclusions described in the agreement.
Swap Agreement and Base Oil Agreement
On January 29, 2016, we (through Vertex Operating) and Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc. (“Safety-Kleen”) entered into a Swap Agreement (the “Swap Agreement”). The Swap Agreement has a term of five years, beginning January 29, 2016, and automatically renews for additional one year terms thereafter unless either party provides the other 90 days prior written notice of their intention not to renew prior to any automatic extension. Pursuant to the Swap Agreement, we and Safety-Kleen agreed to swap certain quantities of used oil feedstock (the agreement includes monthly maximums, quarterly minimums and maximums, and annual maximums of used oil feedstock volume required to be ‘swapped’) between Safety-Kleen's plant in Nevada and our Marrero, Louisiana plant and/or the Cedar Marine Terminal in Baytown, Texas, on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis, with any shortfall in the amount of used oil feedstock ‘swapped’ on a quarterly basis, being paid for in cash based on a discount to U.S. Platts mid-range per gallon rate for Gulf Coast No. 6, 3% oil (the “Platts”). The Swap Agreement can be terminated with 30 days prior written notice in the event either party fails to meet the specifications for oil feedstock set forth in the agreement, a party fails to deliver the required minimum quarterly volumes of oil feedstock during any three consecutive quarters, or a party materially breaches a term of the agreement.
Additionally, we (through Vertex Operating) and Safety-Kleen also entered into a Base Oil Agreement on January 29, 2016 (the “Base Oil Agreement”). The Base Oil Agreement provides for us to purchase from Safety-Kleen, and Safety-Kleen to sell to us, certain required quantities of base oils and other finished lubricants described in greater detail in the Base Oil Agreement (the “Base Oil”)(the agreement contains quarterly and annual maximum volumes of Base Oil to be acquired by us). The agreement has a term of five years and automatically renews for additional one year terms thereafter unless either party provides the other 90 days prior written notice of their intention not to renew prior to any automatic extension.
Competition
The industrial waste and brokerage of petroleum products industries are highly competitive. There are numerous small to mid-size firms that are engaged in the collection, transportation, treatment and brokerage of virgin and used petroleum products. Competitors include, but are not limited to: Safety-Kleen, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clean Harbors, Inc.), Rio Energy, Inc., Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc., and FCC Environmental (formerly Siemens Hydrocarbon Recovery Services), and Flex Oil Service, LLC. These competitors actively seek to purchase feedstock from local, regional and industrial collectors, refineries, pipelines and other sources. Competition for these feedstocks may result in increasing prices to obtain used motor oil and transmix feedstocks critical to the success of our business. In order to remain competitive, we must control costs and maintain strong 
9

relationships with our feedstock suppliers. Our network of generators and collectors minimizes our reliance on any single supplier. A portion of the sales of the collected and aggregated used motor oil product are based on supply contracts which include a range of prices which change based on feedstock quality specifications and volumes. This pricing structure helps to insulate us from inventory risk by ensuring a spread between costs to acquire used motor oil feedstock and the revenues received for delivery of the feedstock. We believe that price and service are the main competitive factors in the used motor oil collection industry. We believe that our ability to accept and transport large volumes of oil year round gives us an advantage over many of our competitors. In addition, we believe that our storage capacity and ability to process the streams of products we receive as well as our ability to transport the end product by barge, rail and truck provide further advantages over many of our competitors.
Employees
We and our wholly and majority owned subsidiaries have 215 full-time employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Seasonality
The industrial hydrocarbon recovery business is seasonal to the extent that it is dependent on streams from seasonal industries. For example, asphalt plants burn recycled waste oil in their process, placing pricing and supply availability constraints on the industry during the good weather construction and road building seasons. In our current markets, road paving typically occurs from late spring to early fall. Therefore, it is somewhat easier to procure certain waste streams during winter months when competition for used motor oil feedstock is historically not as strong. Currently we are seeing increased demand for used motor oil feedstocks throughout the year due to the addition of re-refining technologies in the marketplace.
Governmental Regulation, Including Environmental Regulation and Climate Change
Our operations are subject to stringent United States federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Additional laws and regulations, or changes in the interpretations of existing laws and regulations, that affect our business and operations may be adopted, which may in turn impact our financial condition. 
Additionally, the U.S. Departments of Transportation, Coast Guard and Homeland Security as well as various federal, state, local and foreign agencies exercise broad powers over our transportation operations, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and permits to conduct transportation business. We may also become subject to new or more restrictive regulations that the Departments of Transportation and Homeland Security, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency or other authorities impose, including regulations relating to engine exhaust emissions, the hours of service that our drivers may provide in any one time period, security and other matters.
Our compliance challenges arise from various legislative and regulatory bodies influenced by political, environmental, health and safety concerns.
For example, changes in federal regulations relating to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether and new sulfur limitations for product shipped in domestic pipelines resulted in tightened specifications of gasoline blendstock that we were refining, causing a corresponding decrease in revenue and gross margin growth during 2016, as compared to prior years. This change in regulation, as well as other emission-related regulations, had a material impact on the entire petroleum industry, and we adapted and managed our operations by finding materials better suited to comply with these regulations. As such, it is possible that future changes in federal regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations.
We must also obtain and maintain a range of federal, state and local permits for our various logistical needs as well as our planned industrial processes.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing health, safety and environmental laws and regulations to which our operations are subject.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
The United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain defined persons, including current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under 
10

CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies.
In the course of our operations, we occasionally generate materials that are considered “hazardous substances” and, as a result, may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs. Also, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants. We also generate solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the United States Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or “RCRA,” and comparable state statutes.
Although we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at properties owned or leased by us now or in the past, or at other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for treatment or disposal. Under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we could be required to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act, as amended, or “CAA,” and similar state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain approvals or permits for construction, modification or operation of certain projects or facilities and may require use of emission controls.
Global Warming and Climate Change
While we do not believe our operations raise climate change issues different from those generally raised by the commercial use of fossil fuels, legislation or regulatory programs that restrict greenhouse gas emissions in areas where we conduct business or that would require reducing emissions from our truck fleet could increase our costs.
Water Discharges
We operate facilities that are subject to requirements of the United States Clean Water Act, as amended, or “CWA,” and analogous state laws for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters. Among other things, these laws impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants, including into navigable waters as well as the protection of drinking water sources. Spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements under the CWA require implementation of measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill. Other requirements for the prevention of spills are established under the United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or “OPA”, which amended the CWA and applies to owners and operators of vessels, including barges, offshore platforms and certain onshore facilities. Under OPA, regulated parties are strictly liable for oil spills and must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties could be statutorily responsible.
State Environmental Regulations
Our operations involve the storage, handling, transport and disposal of bulk waste materials, some of which contain oil, contaminants and other regulated substances. Various environmental laws and regulations require prevention, and where necessary, cleanup of spills and leaks of such materials and some of our operations must obtain permits that limit the discharge of materials. Failure to comply with such environmental requirements or permits may result in fines and penalties, remediation orders and revocation of permits. Specifically in Texas, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, including those designed to protect the environment and monitor compliance with water quality. In Louisiana, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources as to environmental and water quality issues, and the Louisiana Public Service Commission as to allocation of intrastate routes and territories for waste water transportation. We believe that we are in compliance with regulations in the states where we conduct business.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA,” and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Transportation Regulations
11

We may conduct interstate motor carrier (trucking) operations that are subject to federal regulation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or “FMCSA,” a unit within the United States Department of Transportation, or “USDOT.” The FMCSA publishes and enforces comprehensive trucking safety regulations, including rules on commercial driver licensing, controlled substance testing, medical and other qualifications for drivers, equipment maintenance, and drivers’ hours of service, referred to as “HOS.” The agency also performs certain functions relating to such matters as motor carrier registration (licensing), insurance, and extension of credit to motor carriers’ customers. Another unit within USDOT publishes and enforces regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials, or “hazmat.” 
In December 2010, the FMCSA launched a program called Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or “CSA,” in an effort to improve commercial truck and bus safety. A component of CSA is the Safety Measurement System, or “SMS,” which analyzes all safety violations recorded by federal and state law enforcement personnel to determine a carrier’s safety performance. The SMS is intended to allow the FMCSA to identify carriers with safety issues and intervene to address those problems. Although our trucking operations currently hold a “Satisfactory” safety rating from FMCSA (the best rating available), the agency has announced a future intention to revise its safety rating system by making greater use of SMS data in lieu of on-site compliance audits of carriers. We cannot predict the effect such a revision may have on our safety rating.
Our intrastate trucking operations are also subject to various state environmental transportation regulations discussed under “Environmental Regulations” above. Federal law also allows states to impose insurance and safety requirements on motor carriers conducting intrastate business within their borders, and to collect a variety of taxes and fees on an apportioned basis reflecting miles actually operated within each state.
HOS regulations establish the maximum number of hours that a commercial truck driver may work. A FMCSA rule reducing the number of hours a commercial truck driver may work each day became effective in February 2012 and the compliance date of selected provisions was July 1, 2013. The rule, which is intended to reduce the risk of fatigue and fatigue-related crashes and harm to driver health, prohibits a driver from driving if more than eight hours have passed since the driver’s last off-duty or sleeper berth break of at least 30 minutes and limits the use of the restart to once a week, which, on average, will cut the maximum work week from 82 to 70 hours. 
A new regulation primarily impacting our marine bunker fuel production is known as “IMO 2020”. On January 1, 2020, the International Maritime Organization (the "IMO") will implement a new regulation for a 0.50% global sulphur cap for marine fuels. Under the new global cap, ships that traverse the oceans will be required to use marine fuels with a sulphur content of no more than 0.50%, versus the current limit of 3.50%, in an effort to reduce the amount of sulphur oxide and decrease pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the global shipping fleet. 
There are several variables around this regulatory change that are not yet clear, including anticipated levels of compliance and enforcement. However, it is expected that the implementation of IMO 2020 will result in a significant increase in near-term demand for a broad range of low sulfur distillates including diesel, marine gas oil, marine diesel oil and VGO among others. There is uncertainty about the global refinery industry’s ability to meet that spike in demand, which could have substantial consequences for the pricing of those products, particularly VGO. The price of VGO typically has a direct impact on the pricing and/or levels of production of base oil. Changes in the marine fuel market as a result of IMO 2020 are also expected to affect the availability of used motor oil, which today is frequently used in the marine market and some of which may be displaced as a result of this new rule.
Our Marrero facility is already producing and selling IMO 2020 compliance bunker fuel.
Inflation and Commodity Price Risk
To date, our business has not been significantly affected by inflation. We purchase petroleum and petroleum by-products for consolidation and delivery, as well as for our own refining operations. By virtue of constant changes in the market value of petroleum products, we are exposed to fluctuations in both revenues and expenses. We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, No. 6 Fuel Oil and refined petroleum products. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, such as futures and options. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.
We primarily use commodity derivative instruments as economic hedges, which are not designated as hedging instruments, and we use fair value and cash flow hedges from time to time. 
12

Our objectives for holding economic hedges are to (i) manage price volatility in certain feedstock and refined petroleum product inventories and fixed-price purchasing, and (ii) lock in the price of forecasted feedstock, refined petroleum product, and refined petroleum product sales at existing market prices. 
 The purchase of our used motor oil feedstock tends to track with natural gas pricing due to the market’s typical practice of substituting used motor oil for natural gas as a fuel source for various industrial processes. On the other hand, the prices of the products that may in the future be generated through the re-refining processes that we hope to develop are expected to track with market pricing for marine diesel and vacuum-gas oil. The recent drop in oil prices has decreased the spread between the price of used motor oil, feedstock and re-refining end-products.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, trade secrets, technical know-how and other proprietary information. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees.
We have two patents registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office relating to our TCEP technology:

• | “System For Making A Usable Hydrocarbon Product From Used Oil” (#8,613,838), which was granted on December 24, 2013; and
