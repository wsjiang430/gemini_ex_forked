Our Mission
Connect LGBTQ people with one another and the world.
Our Company
We are the world’s largest social network focused on the LGBTQ community with approximately 12.2 million monthly active users (“MAUs”) and approximately 788 thousand Paying Users (as defined below) in 2022. Our Paying Users were over 788 and 601 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. According to the Frost & Sullivan Study commissioned by Grindr, we are the largest and most popular gay mobile app in the world, with more MAUs than other LGBTQ social networking applications. We enable our users to find and engage with each other, share content and experiences, and generally express themselves. We are a pioneer and leading influence on the lifestyle trends and discourse among the global LGBTQ community. We are devoted to providing a platform for social interactions for this vibrant community and to cultivating a safe and accepting environment where all are welcome and feel a sense of belonging. As a result, our platform has become a meaningful part of our users’ social lives and has embedded us at the center of the community as the preferred channel for broadening their connections and engaging with like-minded individuals within the LGBTQ community.
We believe Grindr fulfills crucial needs for the LGBTQ community. While the broader global landscape of social networks is highly competitive with many different platforms, there are few global platforms that focus solely on the LGBTQ community and addressing their unique needs, including LGBTQ centric social activities or heightened privacy. For many years and still even today, people from the LGBTQ community are often discriminated against, marginalized, and targeted. Few global platforms exist where these individuals can truly be their authentic selves and feel safe to express themselves freely. As a result, the queer community often have a difficult time finding other members of the community with similar interests, beliefs, or values. This experience can be isolating and disheartening. 
Our platform enables the LGBTQ community to connect with each other and the world. Our platform has many distinct user segments—a diverse set of queer genders and sexualities, varied ages and demographics, various sub-communities, private and discreet users, and urban and rural users. Our users also have a range of motivations and use cases. Our platform helps our users find what they are looking for: casual dating, relationships and love, community and friendships, travel information, local and discovery, and beyond. By facilitating the connection of our users around the world, we believe we have the potential to help our community find each other and interact, advance global LGBTQ rights, and make the world a safer place for all LGBTQ people.
Our core product, the Grindr App, has become an integral part of the daily lives of millions of members of the LGBTQ community around the world, enabling them to discover and connect with each other effortlessly and anytime. The Grindr App offers a variety of location-based social features and functions, including identity expression (profile, photos, presence), connection (search, filters, the Cascade, Viewed Me), interaction (chat, media sharing), trust and safety tools across the experience, and subscriptions for premium features offering more access and control. Since our inception in 2009, we have continued to innovate our technologies to improve the Grindr app, adding new features and safety elements, which has allowed us to increase our MAUs and other metrics over the years. The Grindr App has MAUs in over 190 countries and territories, including developed markets such as the United States, the U.K., France, Spain, and Canada, and emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, India, Chile, and the Philippines, creating a high barrier to entry for our competitors.
We have attracted a highly engaged, and rapidly growing user base, as evidenced by the following:
•Approximately 12.2 million MAUs in 2022. 
•Approximately 788 thousand Paying Users in 2022. Our Paying Users increased by 31.0% in 2022, as compared to 2021.
•MAUs in over 190 countries and territories in the world as of December 31, 2022.
•21 supported languages on Android and 9 on iOS as of December 31, 2022.
•On average, users on our platform sent over 308 million daily messages in 2022.
•Our profiles spent an average of 58 minutes per day each on the Grindr App in December 2022, which ranks us number one among apps focused on the LGBTQ community, according to the Frost & Sullivan Study commissioned by Grindr.

Our largest markets are currently North America and Europe, from which we derived 86.9% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. After North America and Europe, Asia-Pacific makes up an additional 6.1% of our total revenue, and the remaining 4.6% and 2.4% are from other regions, including Latin America (comprising Central America and South America) and Australia, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Our target market is the worldwide LGBTQ community, which comprises more than 538.4 million people globally that self-identify as LGBTQ and represented approximately 6.9% of the total global population as of December 31, 2021, according to the Frost & Sullivan Study commissioned by Grindr. With the progression of LGBTQ culture and increase in LGBTQ rights around the world, this growing and highly engaged community has had an increasingly stronger voice and has been enabled to pursue more diverse lifestyles, express its opinions, and advocate for equal rights. We are dedicated to creating value and a safe and accepting environment for the LGBTQ community.
We believe we have significant opportunities to leverage our unique brand to both broaden and deepen our market penetration and offer products and services that address the growing and changing needs of the global LGBTQ community. With this broader opportunity in mind, we have continued to expand our platform, which offers a unique combination of social networking functions, digital content, and other initiatives aimed at enriching and empowering the lives of the LGBTQ community, in the following ways:
•We help people find meaningful connections, whether it's casual dating, relationships and love, community and friendships, travel information, local and discovery, and beyond.
•Our platform builds community and friendships. Our user experience is essentially a world without walls, connecting one user to the next, allowing the community to see each other, many of whom sometimes feel unseen. 
•We are advancing LGBTQ equality and safety. Our Grindr for Equality initiative, or G4E, has worked around the world for the safety and justice for the LGBTQ community. Coordinating with NGOs, governments, and nonprofits, G4E has worked to change and inform policy, increase access to vital healthcare services such as HIV testing, and bring valuable information to millions of people in over 50 languages.
•We bring empowerment through partnerships with organizations such as Aids/Lifecycle, National/Local Pride Organizations, and Voting Campaigns. 
•We drive social influence with fun and engaging ways on social media channels to help the general population better understand our community, plight, and interconnectedness. 
We believe our brand and logo have become mainstays of the global LGBTQ experience. According to the Morning Consult Survey, we are the best-known gay dating app among Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer people, with 85.0% brand awareness, as well as the best-known gay dating app among the general population. The strength of our brand has allowed us to grow our users virally and organically, as evidenced by the fact that our customer acquisition spend only comprised 0.3% of total revenue in 2022. This is a core feature of our business model. As our user base continues to grow worldwide, more connections are made, and our user engagement and revenue increase. These increases enable us to reinvest in our platform, building more product and safety features and, as a result, attract more users. This results in powerful network effects, driving user and revenue growth and reinforcing our brand awareness. 
We currently generate revenue from two revenue streams—Direct Revenue and Indirect Revenue, both of which are driven by the Grindr app. Direct Revenue is revenue generated by our Paying Users who pay for subscriptions or add-ons to access premium features. While our app is free to use, our premium features enable our users to customize their ability to experience and use our platform. Indirect Revenue is generated by third parties who pay us for access to our users, such as advertising or partnerships. Our financial model has significant benefits and has experienced rapid revenue growth and profitability driven predominantly by organic user acquisition and the viral network effects enabled by our brand and market position. 
•For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we generated:
◦Total revenue of $195.0 million and $145.8 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 33.7%;
◦Net Income of $0.9 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was $(4.2) million, or (82.4)%; and
◦Adjusted EBITDA of $85.2 million and $77.1 million, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was $8.1 million, or 10.6%.

The Business Combination
Grindr's predecessor public company was originally incorporated in the Cayman Islands on September 18, 2017 under the name Tiga Acquisition Corp. (“Tiga”), a special-purpose acquisition company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Grindr was originally incorporated in February 2009 as a California limited liability company, and was subsequently held by Grindr Group LLC ("Legacy Grindr"), a Delaware limited liability company which was incorporated in April 2020.
Between November 17, 2022 and November 18, 2022, Legacy Grindr, Tiga, Tiga Merger Sub I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of Tiga (“Tiga Merger Sub”), and Tiga Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of Tiga, consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 9, 2022 (the “Original Merger Agreement”), by and among Tiga, Legacy Grindr, Tiga Merger Sub, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 5, 2022, by and among Tiga, Tiga Merger Sub, Legacy Grindr and Tiga Merger Sub II (together with the Original Merger Agreement, the “Merger Agreement”), following its approval at an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of Tiga held on November 15, 2022. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a business combination of Legacy Grindr and Tiga was effected through, among other transactions, (i) the merger of Tiga Merger Sub I with and into Legacy Grindr, with Legacy Grindr as the surviving entity (the “First Merger”), and promptly thereafter and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, (ii) the merger of Legacy Grindr with and into Tiga Merger Sub II (the “Second Merger”), with Tiga Merger Sub II surviving the Second Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tiga. Prior to the closing of the business combination on November 18, 2022 (“Closing”), Tiga (i) changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware by deregistering as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands and domesticating and continuing as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and (ii) changed its name from Tiga Acquisition Corp. to Grindr Inc. (the “Business Combination”). 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in this Annual Report to Form 10-K to the “Company,” “Grindr,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar terms refer to Grindr, Inc. (f/k/a Tiga Acquisition Corp.) and its consolidated subsidiaries (including Legacy Grindr). References to “Tiga” refer to the predecessor company prior to Closing.
Market Overview
The global LGBTQ population has undergone steady growth in recent years, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 6.7% from 390.0 million in 2016 to 538.4 million in 2021, according to the Frost & Sullivan Study, which was commissioned by Grindr, of the global LGBTQ population. The Frost & Sullivan Study commissioned by Grindr estimated this growth trend will continue over the next five years, growing at a CAGR of 4.2% and reaching 659.9 million in 2026. 
The global growth of the LGBTQ population is not just driven by overall population growth, but by the growing social acceptance level towards the LGBTQ community and the LGBTQ population’s willingness to express sexual orientation and gender identity. We believe increasing social acceptance of the LGBTQ community and more LGBTQ friendly political environments globally will continue to contribute to the increase in the number of people that self-identify as LGBTQ. This is evidenced by Frost & Sullivan’s estimate of the LGBTQ population’s percentage of the total population, growing from 5.3% in 2016 to 6.9% in 2021 to an estimated 8.2% by 2026. Additionally, the study also notes the LGBTQ population estimate may vary from country to country and in total, based on different cultural backgrounds, the political system of the country, economic development, and other factors.
We believe our global addressable market encompasses the entire LGBTQ population and not just LGBTQ singles, as we are a social network and our users frequently use our platform and services for more than just dating. For example, many of our users are in relationships but continue to use our app for travel or to stay connected with their friends or the broader LGBTQ community.
Estimated Self-identified LGBTQ Population and Proportion of Total Population

Table of Contents

According to the Frost & Sullivan Study commissioned by Grindr, the GBTQ population make up the largest proportion of the overall LGBTQ population, comprising almost 81% of the total with 434.9 million people in 2021. The Frost & Sullivan Study commissioned by Grindr estimates the GBTQ population will continue to grow as a percentage of the overall LGBTQ population, with the percentage increasing to over 81% by 2026.
Estimated Self-Identified LGBTQ Population, Breakdown by Gender Identity

The self-identified LGBTQ population skews towards younger generations. According to the Frost & Sullivan Study commissioned by Grindr, self-identified LGBTQ 18-24 year olds are estimated at 10.3% of the total 18-24 year old global population in 2021, 25-34 year olds are estimated at 8.9%, and 35-49 year olds are estimated at 6.3%, respectively. These population percentages are expected to grow to 13.4% of the total 18-24 year old global population by 2026, 10.9% for 25-34 year olds, and 7.3% for 35-49 year olds, respectively.
Social development and rapidly changing points of view brought on by the growth of the Internet has objectively caused Gen Z, (18-24 year olds), to be exposed to more ideas, such as gender awareness and sexual orientation, earlier than previous generations in the same period. Younger generations are more gender fluid, with the definition of gender identity becoming more indistinct, blurring the boundary between the LGBTQ community and the heterosexual population. These younger generations are more likely to explore their sexuality, given more social acceptability of alternative sexual identities today and the ability to express different sexual identities.
Estimated Self-Identified LGBTQ Population Penetration Rate, Breakdown by Age Group (Medium Estimate)

According to the Frost & Sullivan Study commissioned by Grindr, the total self-identified LGBTQ population and self-identified LGBTQ population penetration rate in most regions is expected to continue to increase over time. The self-identified LGBTQ population and penetration rate in North America will grow from 36.9 million and 9.9% in 2021 to 40.7 million and 10.7% in 2026, respectively. Europe will grow from 61.6 million and 8.2% in 2021 to 74.8 million and 10.0% in 2026, respectively. Asia will grow from 372.8 million and 8.0% in 2021 to 468.7 million and 9.6% in 2026, respectively. Latin America will grow from 56.8 million and 8.6% in 2021 to 62.1 million and 9.0% in 2026, respectively.

Estimated Self-identified LGBTQ Population, Breakdown by Region

Global LGBTQ Social Context 
In recent decades, societies around the world have generally become more socially accepting of, and open to, LGBTQ culture and people, which has led to greater rights for members of the LGBTQ community. For example, the Netherlands was the first country to legalize same-sex marriage in 2000. According to various sources, as of April 2022, over 75 countries and territories have legalized same-sex marriage, including jurisdictions in every inhabited continent across the globe. Additionally, according to the ILGA World Report, same-sex sexual activities were legal in over 120 countries and territories worldwide, including all of the countries in North America and Europe and the majority of the countries in Asia and Latin America. 
LGBTQ Population’s Consumption
We believe our user base represents a highly coveted demographic. According to the Frost & Sullivan Study commissioned by Grindr, data from the American Community Survey showed that same-sex couples have a higher median household income than opposite-sex couples, with male same-sex couples having the highest income. Educational attainment is an important social phenomenon, which is strongly linked to later success in terms of income, occupation, wealth, health, and life satisfaction. In the United States, male same-sex households are more likely to have at least a bachelor’s degree than opposite-sex households. In 2020, 57.5% of male same-sex households had at least a bachelor’s degree compared to 42.4% of opposite-sex households. As individuals, 55.1% of the gay and bisexual men population have at least a bachelor’s degree compared to 30.3% of the straight male population. 
From a macro-level perspective, the more LGBTQ inclusion a country has, the more likely it is to be economically developed. LGBTQ inclusion and economic development are mutually reinforcing, and LGBTQ legal rights have a continued positive and statistically significant association with real GDP per capita after controlling for gender equality. Also, from the perspective of society, employers who treat LGBTQ people equally in the workplace will generally see positive business outcomes such as higher productivity of LGBTQ workers, notable improvements in health, lower costs, and a lower likelihood of employee turnover.
Estimated LGBTQ Population GDP at Purchasing Power Parity (“PPP”)
 As the global pandemic caused by COVID-19 gradually improves, global GDP at purchasing power parity growth resumed upward trends in 2021 and experienced an estimated increase of 6.5%, according to the Frost & Sullivan Study commissioned by Grindr. Correspondingly, the estimated LGBTQ population GDP at PPP has also seen an increase, 
Table of Contents

reaching $10.9 billion by the end of 2021. GDP at PPP is the calculation of GDP taking relative costs and inflation into account. 
Given this high purchasing power and economic potential, the LGBTQ community is an increasingly attractive demographic for marketers and advertisers. The scale of purchasing power associated with the LGBTQ demographic, coupled with a general interest to appeal to a younger demographic, have caused marketers to increase their focus on reaching this community. Some of the world’s largest corporations and brands have launched LGBTQ-themed or focused advertising campaigns, including Apple, Johnson & Johnson, GM, Coca-Cola, Campbell’s, American Express, Unilever, Marriott, Anheuser-Busch, and Hilton, just to name a few.
Our Products and Services
Our flagship product “Grindr,” or the Grindr App, is a mobile application with location-based connectivity features designed to help our users find one another and have meaningful interactions right here and now, or anywhere globally. The app is free to use, with premium subscription offerings for greater access to other users and control over the experience.

Key features of our Grindr App include: 
Identity expression: users can create, manage, and control their identity, profile, and presence on the app. 
Connection: users can find and be found by those they are interested in; those nearby right now, or anywhere globally. 
Interaction: users can chat and interact with any profile instantly, in an open, fun, and engaging way. 
Trust and Safety: users receive guidance and tools to be safe across their experience. 
Premium: users can pay for greater access to more users and for more control over how they find one another and interact.

We launched the Grindr App in 2009 to create a new way for gay men to find each other and form connections. Our initial differentiator was a cascade engine to help find other users nearby in an exciting and highly responsive app experience leading to high engagement and rapid organic growth. Our initial active user segment of gay men, our real-time and hyper-local use case of casual dating, and our industry-defining cascade user interface and open messaging connection model, combine to create a fun and highly engaging experience on the app. This engagement engine has fueled our rapid organic growth over time leading to more users, segments, geographies, and use cases. 
Over time, we evolved into the world’s largest LGBTQ social network and we enable our users to engage on our platform in a variety of ways. We believe we have played an integral role in both establishing, defining, and developing the location-based dating industry and developing wider mainstream acceptance of LGBTQ individuals on a global basis.

User and Product Journey
Identity expression: Getting started on Grindr is easy. Users create an account and profile that represents themselves and their identity on the platform. They create an account and verify important information to help maintain a trustworthy and safe environment on the app. Then they are able to create a rich, visual, personalized profile with a wide range of data and information about themselves, their interests, and motivations. This helps them express who they are, what they seek, and makes it easy for all to meet one another and form meaningful connections.

1. Sign up: New users create an account with their email, or through social media account authentication (e.g., Facebook, Google, Apple). | 2. Age verification: Users verify their age to confirm they are not a minor, and that they are eligible to use the Grindr service.

Grindr is unique in its open messaging model: users can initiate a message with any profile, regardless of whether interest has been expressed beforehand, a key aspect of our engagement engine. Within the messaging feature, users can form meaningful connections and deepen them over time by sharing rich media and with a variety of messaging formats. 

1. Open Messaging: users can interact with anyone of interest through our unique open messaging platform. They can initiate one or multiple messages from profiles on their cascades, or respond to messages sent to them. | 2.

Social Responsibility—Grindr for Equality
We launched G4E in 2012, with a mission to promote safety, health, and human rights for LGBTQ people around the world through collaborations with advocacy groups in various countries. G4E leverages the Grindr App’s global reach and leadership to conduct research, spread information, and empower our users in the fight for LGBTQ rights. We also fund innovative projects through G4E aimed at improving the welfare of the LGBTQ community, particularly in regions where protections are either lacking or nonexistent, such as Russia, Egypt, and India. For example, in India, we worked with the Indian gender and sexuality organization, Varta Trust, and Chennai-based not-for-profit Solidarity and Action Against the HIV Infection in India (SAATHII), to develop an innovative and one-of-a-kind LGBTQ resource database and online HIV test center location guide for the country. Through G4E, we work with various groups worldwide to make HIV testing more accessible, encourage voting, and fight homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia.
G4E is a key way for us to connect with and serve the LGBTQ community and to strengthen our brand affinity within this community, especially in parts of the world where LGBTQ people are still highly marginalized. For advocacy groups with limited budgets, our platform is a helpful tool for them to reach a wider audience and promote their services and resources. We hope to continue to increase our financial commitment to G4E, thereby furthering our continued and active advocacy for, and defense and support of, the LGBTQ community worldwide.
We encourage members of the LGBTQ community to have a voice, express their opinions and help fight against oppression. Our geolocation technology enables us to send messages targeted towards specific areas and groups of users to keep them updated on the issues most relevant to them.
Our Competitive Advantages
While the broader global landscape of mobile-based social platforms is highly competitive with many different players, the number of players that are specifically addressing the unique needs of the global LGBTQ community is limited. There are a number of key factors that drive demand for certain platforms specifically dedicated to the LGBTQ community versus those that target the general population. For instance, LGBTQ users have heightened and special concerns relating to privacy, particularly with respect to identity protection, making it important that independent online platforms dedicated to serving LGBTQ users provide a safe and secure place for users to express themselves. Additionally, general social platforms are less likely to offer LGBTQ-specific community opportunities to meet other LGBTQ users, whereas LGBTQ dedicated social networking platforms substantially improve the ability of LGBTQ users to find and join LGBTQ centric social activities. As a result, LGBTQ social networking users tend to show higher engagement and retention on LGBTQ dedicated platforms.
We believe certain advantages will continue to provide us with sustainable differentiation and success relative to our competitors:
•The Largest Global LGBTQ Focused Mobile Social Platform. We were established in 2009 as one of the first global social platforms exclusively addressing the needs of the LGBTQ community. We built our mobile social platform to address the broadly underserved LGBTQ community’s need for a comprehensive digital platform to connect, share, and consume content. Driven by our first-mover advantage, we have rapidly built the world’s largest LGBTQ social platform in terms of users in 2021, according to the Frost & Sullivan Study commissioned by Grindr. In 2022, we had approximately 12.2 million MAUs and users in over 190 countries and territories, with our Grindr App available in over 21 language versions. We have users in several markets as of December 31, 2022, including developed markets such as the United States, the U.K., France, Spain, and Canada, and emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, India, Chile, and the Philippines.
•Large, Highly Engaged, and Growing User Base. Our large and highly engaged global user base drives the continuous growth of our daily operations. The Grindr App had approximately 12.2 million MAUs in 2022. During the same period, our users on average sent over 260 million chats and each individual user spent an average of 58 minutes per day on our Grindr app. 
•Preeminent Brand within the LGBTQ Community. Our brand is one of the most well-known in the LGBTQ community and has become broadly associated with LGBTQ culture. According to the Morning Consult Survey, Grindr is the best-known gay dating app among Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer people, with 85% brand awareness, and is also the best-known gay dating app among the general population. We are frequently mentioned by world-class media, including the BBC, CNN, and other influential media platforms, and we have more social media followers than most of our competitors on nearly every platform, which helps to constantly reinforce the social exposure of our brand. Additionally, our G4E campaigns have further strengthened our brand awareness and our position as a leader within the LGBTQ community. Our G4E campaigns proactively promote justice, health, safety, and other LGBTQ rights. The various elements of our growing platform combine online and offline aspects of our users’ social presence to engage our users in novel and meaningful ways, helping to embed us as a core part of the LGBTQ culture.
•Organic and Viral Growth Driven by Network Effects. As a pioneer in the LGBTQ social networking space, we have benefited from a substantial first mover advantage and reached a scale that continues to propel the viral growth of our business, brand awareness, and user acquisition. Leveraging this strong brand awareness and

significant user network, our historical growth has been driven primarily by network effects, including strong word of mouth referrals and other organic means. The large scale of our user base offers ample opportunities for potential connections and leads to a better experience for our users. The superior user experience of our products and services attracts more users to our platform and increases our rankings in search engines and app stores. As a result, we believe we achieve a higher frequency of word-of-mouth referrals from satisfied users, which further drives our scale while maintaining low user acquisition costs. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, sales and marketing, excluding personnel-related expenses, comprised 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively, of our revenue over the same time period. 
•Superior User Experience. We believe the superior user experience we offer distinguishes us from our competitors. We have devoted substantial resources to continuously improving our products and services and enhancing the user experience. We emphasize technology and product innovations based on robust data compiled from product usage, competitive studies, customer feedback, and our industry experience. Our geolocation technology, grid display interface, complex filter functions, and other innovative features and functionalities enable users to discover and connect to each other effortlessly and seamlessly. Our profiles spent an average of 58 minutes per day each on the Grindr App in December 2022, which ranks us number one among apps targeting the LGBTQ community, according to the Frost & Sullivan Study commissioned by Grindr.
•Strong Margins and Profitable Business Model. Our business model generates strong margins and high cash flow given our revenue model and low paid user acquisition spend. Our margins have increased over time as a result of scaling revenue and achievement of cost efficiencies, despite continual investment in our brand, product, technology, and anti-abuse platform. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our net margin was 0.4% and 3.5% respectively, and our Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 43.5% and 52.8%, respectively. 
Our Growth Strategies
We believe there is significant opportunity in our core product driven by the rising growth of the global LGBTQ population, especially younger users that are more technology savvy. We believe we are still in the early stages of our user growth and user monetization journeys and believe that our brand and global reach uniquely position us to take advantage of the broader market growth trends. 
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Expand Monetization Capabilities. We believe we can improve our monetization capabilities by continuing to optimize and develop our subscription offerings, introducing more stand-alone premium functions, and further optimizing our indirect revenue offerings, as described in more detail below:
•Continue to optimize and develop our subscription offerings. We plan to continue to optimize our subscription conversion through features like introductory offers, discounted trials, and win-back offers. We plan to continue to develop our subscription offerings by adding more premium features to our XTRA and Unlimited products and services, such as more advanced filters and Cascade navigation, improvements to Viewed Me, and more premium messaging features. We also expect to continue to optimize subscription pricing globally.
•Introduce more stand-alone paid features. We intend to introduce more stand-alone paid features in addition to existing subscription services. For example, we plan to allow some premium features to be purchased on a stand-alone basis, including better profile positions, appearance management, and other functions.
•Further optimize our indirect business. We intend to further optimize our indirect business by leveraging our advertising partnerships, brand sales team, and self-serve advertising system. We will continue to experiment and evaluate opportunities to increase indirect revenue through brand partnerships, unique advertising units, and merchandise.
•Grow Our User Base. We plan to deepen our penetration in our current markets, including in our key established markets such as the United States and Europe. We will continue to introduce additional features that boost user engagement, increase retention, and stimulate existing users to make word-of-mouth referrals. We also plan to enhance our marketing initiatives in these core regions. We also plan to grow our user base by targeting geographic regions outside of our current core markets that have a large number of untapped potential users and fast-growing economies. In order to attract users in these new markets, we may offer innovative and customized products and services and features adapted to specific market conditions and demands. To supplement our organic user growth, we plan to selectively invest in paid online channels, digital video channels and, where appropriate, offline channels, to further improve our penetration and market share in certain markets. 
•Continue to Innovate and Develop New Features. We plan to continue to improve our products and services and introduce new features and functions for better user experiences and higher user engagement. These features and functions may be broadly implemented or strategically targeted at select regions. For example, we released tags globally in the first quarter of 2022, a feature designed to allow our users to filter and find people with specific interests highlighted on user profiles. We evaluate new functions and features in small target audiences and then 
Table of Contents

roll out features with high test ratings to the larger global user base. For example, we recently released private albums first in Australia and New Zealand. After collecting initial feedback and improving the product, we released it globally in 2022. We will also continue to enhance user experiences and engagement by continuously improving our existing features and functions, including through optimization of stability, loading speed, and user interface design.
•Diversify Our Products and Services and Platform. We will continue to diversify our offerings both vertically and horizontally. Our global reach and scale have given us insights into the unique challenges our user base experiences. We believe these insights will enable us to diversify our product into other areas that touch or concern our users. We are in the early stages of building a web-based product that will allow our privacy-focused users a way to use our product without downloading an app through an app ecosystem. Additionally, we are collaborating with several partners in related industries to explore complementary functions and products and services to serve the core social interaction needs of our users. 
•Invest in Machine Learning and Data Science. We will continue to invest in data to improve our product, protect our users, fight abuse and spam on our platform, and attract new users. We believe our efforts in machine learning and data science will help our users have more successful connections and improve the overall experience on our platform. 
•Pursue Strategic Investments and Acquisitions. In addition to organic growth, we also plan to make strategic investments and acquisitions in targeted markets. We are continually seeking opportunities for potential strategic investments in, or acquisitions of, related or complementary businesses to help build a stronger social ecosystem for the LGBTQ community.
Technology
Our technology and product development process, designed for the unique needs of our user base, is what differentiates our platform from other social networks. Our platform development principle is “user privacy and protection first” and all technology and product decisions stem from this key tenet. We have a global team of engineers, data scientists, and product managers who work closely with our data privacy team to drive the development of our product and platform. We aim to build technology that protects our users and enables them to make connections safely. 
Key components of our technology platform include:
•Location-based Technologies. We have built a large-scale location search system to connect our online users’ locations in real-time so they can seamlessly engage with their hyper-local community. This scale and accuracy of our system differentiates us from competitors. Our technology manages millions of users’ real-time locations every second of every day. We have developed a carefully optimized system capable of handling thousands of location update requests as well as thousands of location search requests per second at the same time. The system powers the main cascade user interface in our Grindr App where a user sees others who are also using the Grindr App at that moment based on distance and filter criteria.
•Data Management, Protection, and Privacy. We process over ten terabytes of user data generated on our platform on a daily basis; from that we persist over seven terabytes of data per day. In order to do this, we have built our own data warehouse infrastructure on top of world class third-party platforms. We have also built and deployed tools that allow for easy data summarization, ad hoc querying, and analysis of large datasets. These technologies help us provide each user with a personalized experience. 
•Our Information Security and Data Protection Program closely aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technologies’ (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework. In order to protect our data estate we have devised many procedures and controls to ensure our data is confidential, available, and maintains integrity. The level of controls utilized to maintain confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data is based upon a data matrix that takes into account the sensitivity and criticality of the data. Our controls implore the usage of industry standard one-way hashing, and both symmetric and asymmetric encryption for data at rest and in transit.
•Access to data stores is made available by the usage of a virtual private network (“VPN”) device and is further gated by role-based access controls of privileged accounts. If data access is required for business reasons, it is granted to a specific individual for a specific data asset. All permission requests are approved by a data custodian and all access is monitored and reviewed on a regular basis.
•Large-scale Infrastructure. We have invested considerable resources and investments on our underlying architecture to serve more than a billion daily application programmable interface (“API”) requests. We have also invested resources in adopting container technologies, which allow us to scale our backend systems more easily. We run services in multiple availability zones (data centers) for redundancy. As a cloud-first company, everything we build is designed to scale and run in a stateless environment. Externally, we process over four billion API requests per day. During January 2023, we processed over 10.3 billion messages. We believe these systems will easily continue to scale as we grow.

•Client first technologies. Our APIs are designed to support real-time product features agnostic of the clients (mobile or web). We believe in the approach of build once and leverage across several clients to deliver superior uniform user experience. It’s common for users to switch between devices and other mediums and this system ensures our users can pick up where they left off.
Commitment to our Community
Our diverse, global community is at the heart of everything we do at Grindr. While we support free speech and expression, it cannot be at the expense of our community’s health or well-being. We balance the right to self-expression with promoting a safe and inclusive environment. We take proactive measures to help protect our community and promote safety throughout our users’ journey with us. 
Our app has a suite of safety features, including safety notifications and messages (translated and customized to the user’s region), a PIN to help keep our users’ accounts secure, discreet app icons which allow users to disguise Grindr’s App, a range of features giving control over the sharing of images or messages and redacting them, and the ability to mute, block, and report other users. We also provide video and audio chat so users can become comfortable with each other before meeting. We also publish a holistic security guide and safety tips as guidance. 
We believe education promotes healthy behavior, so we provide an extensive help center with resources and FAQ on health, wellness, community, identity, and safety. We are focused on creating inclusive and forward-thinking moderation policies and frameworks that honor the full expression of our users’ gender identity and support a positive, safe experience for our whole global community. Our suite of tools and technology utilize a three-pillar approach to content moderation:
•Automated Review. We implement preventative technologies to help mitigate risks of user misbehavior. We automatically scan profiles upon creation and conduct ongoing scans for fraudulent behavior or violations of our Community Guidelines. Our algorithms and automations remove many malicious profiles before they can interact with our community. We utilize third party tooling to enhance our automated review capabilities. In addition, we provide users with a robust appeals system which allows our users to have a manual human review of any automated decision. 
•Manual Review. Our experienced human reviewers play an integral role in our moderation process. As of December 31, 2022, we utilized a team of content review personnel dedicated to moderating content on the Grindr App. We believe empathy with and understanding of our community is key to making good moderation decisions. In addition to general moderation training, our moderators regularly receive specific training on bias, gender, microaggressions, and discrimination, to help them make as fair and equitable decisions as possible. In addition to removing and blocking profiles and illicit content, our moderators reinforce our Community Guidelines to our users through our in-app warning system, which reminds our users of our expectations before their behavior escalates. 
•Community Feedback. Our engaged user base also helps us maintain a safe, positive, and inclusive community. Through in-app tools, we encourage users to report inappropriate content and misbehavior.
Branding and Marketing
We have grown primarily through user-driven organic means given the strength of our brand awareness and our extensive user base. We benefit from the network effects and broad global brand awareness that resulted from first-mover advantage and compound to create a positive cycle of user-generated, organic growth. Our valuable brand name and word-of-mouth referrals means we’ve been able to keep user acquisition costs low, which has allowed us to focus our marketing efforts to date largely on community centered campaigns that further our brand reputation while providing opportunities for monetization through brand partnerships. We regularly evaluate opportunities across channels and geographies in which we can invest further to strategically accelerate user and revenue growth. The combination of our strong brand and extensive and global user base has been our most effective marketing tool to date and has enabled us to grow our users.
We also employ paid online and offline marketing initiatives to enhance our category leading brand reputation within the LGBTQ community and to accelerate our growth. Key elements of our branding and marketing strategy include:
•Online Initiatives. We attract new users and generate brand awareness through data and insight-driven content marketing and social media initiatives, influencer marketing campaigns, and video and brand partnerships. In addition, we leverage the Grindr App’s internal marketing tools and capabilities to connect external brands with our user base, and to drive awareness for our own new features and initiatives. We also partner with G4E to provide in-kind donations of digital marketing inventory to LGBTQ community groups around the world. We regularly reassess growth opportunities across all of our organic, owned and operated, and paid channels. To date, relatively little paid online user acquisition has been required for us to grow, given our brand awareness and word-of-mouth referrals. 
Table of Contents

•Offline Initiatives. We organize and participate in a variety of offline events to increase brand awareness and underscore commitment to the LGBTQ community. These events can also provide opportunities for monetization through sponsorships. Examples include WorldPride sponsorships in New York and Copenhagen, the Outfest premier of our first original scripted web series Bridesman, annual activations at San Francisco’s Folsom Street Fair, and a partnership with GoFundMe for the Save Our Spaces campaign that supported historic LGBTQ social venues affected by the pandemic and included hosting more than 30 Grindr-branded parties at local queer bars across the U.S. We intend to continue to explore additional offline marketing opportunities.
Competition
The global LGBTQ social networking market is fast growing and far from being fully addressed. It is also highly fragmented and competitive. We compete primarily with other global companies that provide dating and networking products and services that have LGBTQ users, such as Tinder and OKCupid, and regional companies that provide dating and networking products and services for LGBTQ users, such as Scruff and PlanetRomeo. We also compete with other companies that provide similar social media platforms offering connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, such as Instagram. In addition, while we compete with other social media platforms, we also face competition from other traditional means of meeting people, such as in-person matchmakers, as well as other forms of dating and networking that involve people meeting offline without the use of dating or networking products or services altogether. We may also develop and introduce new products and services which could subject us to additional competition.
Despite its competitive nature, the social networking industry is not a winner-take-all market, with users typically using several different platforms at the same time. We believe very few of our competitors operate at our scale or level of brand awareness. We believe our ability to compete successfully depends on various factors, including, but not limited to:
•our ability to maintain and further develop our well-established brand;
•our ability to continue to engage and grow our user base through technological innovation and introduction of new products and services that meet user requirements; 
•our ability to efficiently distribute our products and services to new and existing users; 
•our ability to improve and maintain superior user experience of our platform, supported by well-designed products and services and functions; 
•our ability to monetize our products and services; 
•our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data; 
•our ability to expand and maintain our global footprint;
•our ability to navigate the changing regulatory landscape, particularly the changes in regulations relating to consumer digital media platforms, privacy and data protection; 
•our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers and product managers; and 
•our ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations.
Employees
We believe our unique culture is one of the keys to our success. We are especially proud of how inclusive our company culture is, particularly for members of the LGBTQ community. Our company culture emphasizes transparency, collaboration, experimentation, a bias for action, and creating an environment in which everyone can bring their full and best selves to work. More than half of our current employees identify as members of the LGBTQ community, which contributes to our deep understanding of our users and our user-first mindset and approach. 
We demonstrate our commitment to this community by aiming to align our employee benefits and support to meet the unique needs of our LGBTQ employees and their dependents. For example, we recently announced a gender-affirmation offering. This standard-setting offering provides low-friction assistance to employees who are transgender, non-binary, or gender non-conforming through social affirmation, legal affirmation, and surgical affirmation assistance. Additionally, we have partnered with providers to help our LGBTQ employees and their dependents find caregivers who they believe are competent in and compassionate towards the unique health needs of members of the LGBTQ community. By creating offerings that address the unique needs of all of our employees, we are demonstrating our commitment to not just our employees but to the LGBTQ community in general. We believe we are setting a new expectation for what are considered fair and equitable benefits, and we are quickly becoming regarded as best-in-class in this area. 
Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2022, we had over 202 full-time employees globally, of which approximately 60% of employees work in engineering and product development. While our headquarters is in West Hollywood, California, our workforce is currently remote-first. This allows us to find the right talent to serve our users, regardless of location. We have concentrations of employees in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, and New York City, which allows our employees a mix of in-person and remote work. This approach continues to be an asset in our recruiting efforts, especially as other tech companies begin to require employees to return to the office or take reductions in pay. Our non-US based employees are located in Taiwan and Canada.
We will continue to strike a balance between being remote-first while facilitating in-person meetings to encourage collaboration, and we will continue to evaluate our location strategy post-pandemic. We believe that people want to work at a company that has purpose and aligns with their personal values, and therefore our ability to recruit talent is aided by our mission and brand reputation. We compete for talent within the technology industry.
Intellectual Property
We have developed our proprietary intellectual property over the past thirteen years. Our patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and contribute to our competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, non-compete agreements, and assignment-for-inventions agreements with our employees, contractors and others and contracts with third parties. We also regularly monitor any infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
As of December 31, 2022, our intellectual property rights include the following:
(1)    registration of over 80 domain names;
(2)    over 50 trademarks and 4 trademark applications;
(3)    12 copyright registrations; and
(4)    6 patents and 1 patent application.
As of December 31, 2022, we have secured six patents in the United States, each of which is set to expire in 2031. 
We license technology and other intellectual property from our partners and rely on our license agreements with those partners to use the intellectual property. Third parties may assert claims related to intellectual property rights against our partners and us.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, as well as foreign ones that involve matters that are important to, or may otherwise impact, our business and that may affect companies conducting business on the internet, including, but not limited to, Internet and eCommerce, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, intellectual property, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, and mobile application and website accessibility. These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies in the United States and abroad, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change or uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, declines in user growth or engagement, negative publicity, or other harm to our business. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change or uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, declines in user growth or engagement, negatively publicity, or other harm to our business.” As a result, we could be subject to actions based on negligence, various torts and trademark and copyright infringement, among other actions. See the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation—We are subject to litigation, regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and adverse outcomes in such proceedings could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation —The varying and rapidly evolving regulatory framework on privacy and data protection across jurisdictions could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation —Activities of our users or content made available by such users could subject us to liability,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation —Online applications are subject to various laws and regulations relating to children’s privacy and protection, which if violated, could subject us to an increased risk of litigation and regulatory actions,” and “Risk Factors—Risks 
Table of Contents

Related to Information Technology Systems and Intellectual Property—From time to time, we are party to intellectual property-related litigations and proceedings that are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely, could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”
In the ordinary course of our business, we may process a significant volume of personal information and other regulated information from our users, employees and other third parties. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous privacy and data protection obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to privacy and data protection. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) (starting in 2023), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (“UK”) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), and the ePrivacy Directive. In addition, several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, and Utah passed the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, all of which become effective in 2023. 
The CCPA, CPRA, EU GDPR and UK GDPR are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal data processing that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for certain data breaches. In addition, the CPRA was expanded on January 1, 2023. The CPRA, among other things, gave California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, establish restrictions on personal data retention, expand the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws also require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data.
Foreign data privacy and security laws (including the GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. As one example, the GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA—the latter of which implicates us as we have no EEA/UK operations. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; and mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals. Users in the UK and EEA transfer their personal data directly to us in the United States, and we notify users that United States may not afford the same privacy protections as their country of residence. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning content regulation and data protection that could affect us. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation—The varying and rapidly evolving regulatory framework on privacy and data protection across jurisdictions could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.” 
We take our data protection obligations seriously as any improper disclosure, particularly with regard to our customers’ sensitive personal data, could negatively impact our business and/or our reputation. See the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business—Security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business” and “—The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing applications of privacy regulations.”
