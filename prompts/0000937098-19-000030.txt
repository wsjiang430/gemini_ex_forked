Item 1. Business 
TriNet is a leading provider of HR expertise, payroll services, employee benefits and employment risk mitigation services for SMBs. Since our founding in 1988, TriNet has served, and continues to serve, thousands of SMBs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we processed $37.7 billion in payroll and payroll taxes for our clients and ended 2018 with approximately 16,900 clients with about 325,600 WSEs primarily in 48 states, the District of Columbia, and in Canada. 
Our Products and Services
We deliver a comprehensive suite of products and services, which allows our clients to administer and manage various HR-related functions, including compensation and benefits, payroll processing, employee data, health insurance and workers' compensation programs, and other transactional HR needs using our technology platform and HR, benefits and compliance expertise.
We also leverage our scale and industry specific HR experience to design product and service offerings for SMBs in specific industries. We believe our industry-specific approach, which we call our vertical approach, is a key differentiator for us and creates additional value for our clients by allowing our product and service offerings to address the common HR needs in different client industries. For example, in 2018 we launched TriNet Professional Services to better support consulting, advertising, and other expertise-driven industries. As of December 31, 2018, we offer six industry-tailored vertical products, TriNet Financial Services, TriNet Life Sciences, TriNet Nonprofit, TriNet Technology, TriNet Main Street, and TriNet Professional Services. 
Our comprehensive HR products and solutions include the following common capabilities:

HR EXPERTISE | ACCESS TO BENEFITS | PAYROLL SERVICES | RISK MITIGATION | TECHNOLOGYPLATFORM

 HR Expertise
We use the collective insights and experience of our teams of HR, benefits, risk management and compliance professionals to help clients manage many of the administrative, regulatory and practical requirements associated with being employers. Our HR professionals and services help clients address a variety of HR issues, including employee onboarding and terminations, benefits enrollment and support, immigration and visa support, and support for certain types of tax credits. Depending on their needs, our clients and WSEs have access to varying levels of service and support from our HR professionals ranging from call center support for basic questions, to pooled HR resources, to onsite consulting and services. Our HR professionals also provide additional specialized HR consulting and services upon request.
 Access to Benefits 
We utilize our size and scale to provide our clients and WSEs access to a broad range of cost-effective, TriNet-sponsored employee benefit and insurance programs at a value that we believe most of our clients would be unable to obtain on their own. Our benefit and insurance programs are designed to comply with state, local, and federal regulations, and our benefit and insurance service offerings include plan design and administration, enrollment management, leave management, plan document distribution and WSE and client communications. 
Under our benefit and insurance programs, we pay third-party insurance carriers for WSE insurance benefits and reimburse insurance carriers or third-party administrators for claims payments within our insurance deductible layer, where applicable.

BUSINESS

We sponsor and administer several fully insured employee benefit plans through a broad range of carriers, including group health, dental, vision, short- and long-term disability, and life insurance as an employer plan sponsor under Section 3(5) of ERISA. We also offer other benefit programs to our WSEs, including flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, retirement benefits, COBRA benefits, individual life insurance, commuter benefits, home insurance, critical illness insurance, accident insurance, hospital indemnity, pet insurance, and auto insurance. For further discussion of our fully insured programs including policies where we reimburse our carriers for certain amounts relating to claims, refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.
 Payroll Services
We help clients manage all aspects of their employee compensation by providing multi-state payroll processing and tax administration services and other payroll-related services, such as time and attendance management, time off and overtime tracking, and expense management solutions. Our clients and WSEs can access payroll and tax information and carry-out a variety of common HR transactions using our online and mobile tools. Our tax administration services include calculating, withholding and reporting certain federal, state and local payroll and unemployment taxes on behalf of clients and WSEs.
 Risk Mitigation
Our HR professionals monitor employment-related regulatory developments at the local, state and federal levels to help our clients comply with employment laws and mitigate many of the risks associated with being an employer. Using our HR experience, we are able to provide guidance on a variety of employment regulations, from state and local laws like minimum wage, unemployment insurance, family and medical leave laws and anti-discrimination laws, to federal laws like the ACA. 
We provide fully insured workers' compensation insurance coverage for our clients and WSEs through insurance policies that we negotiate with our third-party insurance carriers. We manage the deductible risk that we assume in connection with these policies by being selective in the types of businesses that we take on as new clients, and by monitoring claims data and the performance of our carriers and third-party claims management services and vendors. In addition, we advise clients on workers’ compensation best practices, including by performing workplace assessment consultations and assisting with client efforts to identify conditions or practices that might lead to employee injuries.
We also provide EPLI coverage for our clients through insurance policies that we obtain from a third-party EPLI carrier. These policies provide coverage for certain claims that arise in the course of the employment relationship, such as discrimination, harassment, and certain other employee claims, with a per-claim retention amount. The retention amount is split between the client and TriNet, with the client generally paying its portion of the retention amount first.
While we do not provide legal representation to our clients, our clients can benefit from the extensive experience of our employment law specialists and HR professionals who assist clients in implementing HR best practices to avoid employment practices liability claims to manage, process and respond to such claims. For claims covered by our EPLI, actual litigation defense is conducted by outside employment law firms with whom we and our EPLI carriers have previously negotiated rates, established billing guidelines and invoice review processes. We have also developed a case management protocol to efficiently and effectively defend such claims. 
  Technology Platform
Our technology platform includes online and mobile tools that allow our clients and WSEs to store, view, and manage core HR information and administer a variety of HR transactions, such as payroll processing, tax administration, employee onboarding and termination, compensation reporting, expense management, and benefits enrollment and administration. In 2018, we continued to make significant investments in our technology platform to provide our users with improved functionality and HR management options, and we continued to retire legacy technology inherited from acquisitions. We intend to continue to invest in our technology platform to improve its functionality, ease of use and the overall user experience for our clients and WSEs. We believe the continued investment in and improvement of our technology platform will drive operating efficiencies and improve the customer experience.
We invested approximately $81 million, $74 million and $53 million, during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, developing our technology platform.

BUSINESS

Our Co-Employment Model
We operate using a co-employment model, under which employment-related responsibilities are allocated by contract between us and our clients. This model allows WSEs to receive the full benefit of our services, including access to our sponsored employee benefit plan offerings. Each of our clients enters into a client service agreement with us that defines the suite of professional and insurance services and benefits to be provided by us, the fees payable to us, and the division of responsibilities between us and our clients as co-employers. The division of responsibilities under our client service agreements is typically as follows:
TriNet Responsibilities 
We generally assume responsibility for, and manage certain risks associated with:

• | remittance to WSEs of salaries, wages and certain other compensation (as reported and paid to us by our client), related tax reporting and remittance to tax authorities, and processing of garnishment and wage deduction orders. Unlike a payroll service provider, we pay WSEs from our own bank accounts,


• | reporting of wages, withholding and deposit of associated payroll taxes as the employer for regulatory reporting and payroll tax returns,


• | provision and maintenance of workers' compensation insurance and workers' compensation claims processing,


• | provision of access to, and administration of, group health, welfare, and retirement benefits to WSEs under TriNet-sponsored insurance plans,


• | compliance with applicable law for certain employee benefits offered to WSEs,


• | processing of unemployment claims, and


• | provision of certain HR policies, including an employee handbook describing the co-employment relationship.

Client Responsibilities 
Our clients are responsible for employment-related responsibilities that we do not specifically assume, generally including: 

• | day-to-day management of their worksites and WSEs,


• | compliance with laws associated with the classification of employees as exempt or non-exempt, such as overtime pay and minimum wage law compliance,


• | accurate and timely reporting to TriNet of compensation and deduction information, including information relating to hours worked, rates of pay, salaries, wages and certain other compensation,


• | accurate and timely reporting to TriNet of information relating to workplace injuries, employee hires and termination, and certain other information relevant to TriNet’s services,


• | provision and administration of any employee benefits not provided by TriNet such as equity incentive plans,


• | compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to the clients' workplace and business, including work eligibility laws, laws relating to workplace safety or the environment, laws relating to family and medical leave, laws pertaining to employee organizing efforts and collective bargaining and employee termination notice requirements,


• | payment of TriNet invoices, which include salary, wages and other relevant compensation to WSEs and applicable employment taxes and service fees, and


• | all other matters for which TriNet does not assume responsibility under the client service agreement, such as intellectual property ownership and protection and liability for products produced and services provided by the client company to its own customers.

As a result of our co-employment relationship with each of our WSEs, we are liable for payment of salary, wages and certain other compensation to the WSEs as reported and paid to us by the client, and are responsible for providing specified employee benefits to such persons to the extent provided in each client service agreement and under federal and state law. In most instances, clients are required to remit payment prior to the applicable payroll date by wire transfer or ACH.

BUSINESS

We also assume responsibility for payment and liability for the withholding and remittance of federal and state income and employment taxes with respect to salaries, wages and certain other compensation paid to WSEs, although we reserve the right to seek recourse against our clients for any liabilities arising out of their conduct. We perform these functions as the statutory employer for federal employment tax purposes, since our clients transfer legal control over these payroll functions to us. The laws that govern the payment of salaries, wages and related payroll taxes for our WSEs are complex and the various federal, state and local laws that govern such payments can have significant differences. For example, except to the extent applicable federal and state laws otherwise provide, the client may be held ultimately liable for those obligations if we fail to remit taxes and the bonding security provided by the ESAC or other surety is not sufficient to satisfy the obligation. 
Sales and Marketing 
Our Sales Organization
We sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales organization. We have aligned our sales organization by industry vertical with the goal of growing profitable market share in our targeted industries. This vertical approach deepens our network of relationships and gives us an understanding of the unique HR needs facing SMBs in those industries. Our sales representatives are supported by marketing, inside sales, lead generation efforts, and referral networks. 
We sponsor and participate in associations and events around the country and utilize these forums to target specific vertical and geographic markets. We also generate sales opportunities within key industry verticals, through marketing alliances and other indirect channels, such accounting firms, venture capital firms, incubators, insurance brokers, and other vertical market industry associations. Additionally, we utilize digital marketing programs, including digital advertising, search and email marketing, to create awareness and interest in our products. 
Our Marketing Organization
Our marketing organization is charged with driving overall brand awareness, managing lead generation, creating and managing our website and other online properties, creating content for all of our outbound and inbound marketing efforts, media relations, and managing our sponsorships, major marketing events, and client communications. In 2018 our marketing team focused on strategic marketing, communications and branding initiatives, in part by launching a comprehensive company re-branding and marketing campaign that included social media and advertising across digital, television, radio and out-of-home media.
Legal and Regulatory 
Our business operates in a complex environment of numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to our solutions. The following summarizes what we believe are the most important legal and regulatory aspects of our business: 
Federal Regulations
Employer Status 
We sponsor our employee benefit plan offerings as the employer of our WSEs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and ERISA. The multiple definitions of “employer” under both the Code and ERISA are not clear and most are defined in part by complex multi-factor tests under common law. We believe that we qualify as an “employer” of our WSEs in the U.S. under both the Code and ERISA, as well as various state regulations, but this status could be subject to challenge by various regulators. For additional information on our employer status and its impact on our business and results of operations, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K, under the heading - If we are not recognized as an employer of worksite employees under federal and state regulations, or are deemed to be an insurance agent or third-party administrator, we and our clients could be adversely impacted.

BUSINESS

The ACA and Health Care Reform
The ACA was signed into law in March 2010. The ACA implemented sweeping health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 through 2020, and many provisions in the ACA still require the issuance of additional guidance from the DOL, the IRS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and various U.S. states. Passage of the TCJA in December 2017 eliminated the individual mandate tax penalty under the ACA beginning in 2019, while retaining employer ACA obligations. Further significant changes to health care statutes, regulations and policy at the federal, state and local levels could occur in 2019 and beyond, including the potential further modification, amendment or repeal of the ACA. For additional information on the ACA and its impact on our business and results of operations, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K, under the heading - Our business is subject to numerous complex state and federal laws, and changes in, uncertainty regarding, or adverse application of these laws could adversely affect our business.
HIPPA
Maintaining the security of our WSEs information is important to TriNet as we sponsor employee benefit plans and may have access to personal health information (PHI) of our WSEs. The manner in which we manage PHI is subject to HIPAA and the HITECH Act. HIPAA contains restrictions and health data privacy, security and breach notification requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of PHI. Further, under the HITECH Act there are penalties and fines for HIPAA violations. Our health plans are covered entities under HIPAA, and we are therefore required to comply with HIPAA's portability, privacy, and security requirements. 
To the extent possible, the health claim information we possess is anonymized and accessed through a secured third-party database. For additional information on the security of our clients' and WSEs' personal data and PHI and the potential impact to our business if we fail to protect such personal data and PHI, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K, under the heading - Cyber-attacks or security breaches could result in reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, regulatory penalties, and damage to our reputation.
U.S. State Regulations
Forty-four states have adopted provisions for licensing, registration, certification or recognition of co-employers, and others are considering such regulation. Such laws vary from state to state but generally provide for monitoring or ensuring the fiscal responsibility of PEOs, and in some cases codify and clarify the co-employment relationship for unemployment, workers' compensation and other purposes under state laws. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements in those forty-four states.
We must also comply with state unemployment tax requirements where our clients are located. State unemployment taxes are based on taxable wages and tax rates assigned by each state. The tax rates vary by state and are determined, in part, based on our prior years’ compensation and unemployment claims experience in each state. Certain rates are also determined, in part, by each client’s own compensation and unemployment claims experience. In addition, states have the ability under law to increase unemployment tax rates, including retroactively, to cover deficiencies in the unemployment tax funds. 
We must also comply with general state tax laws, including payroll tax laws. Continued tax reform efforts may lead to significant state tax law changes in 2019 and beyond.
Strategic Acquisitions
Historically, we have pursued strategic acquisitions to both expand our product capabilities and supplement our growth across geographies and certain industry verticals. Our acquisition targets have included PEOs and other HR solution providers as well as technology companies or technology product offerings to supplement or enhance our existing HR solutions. We intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, where appropriate, that will enable us to add new clients and WSEs, expand our presence in certain geographies or industry verticals and offer our clients and WSEs more attractive products and services.
Client Industries and Geographies
Our clients are distributed across a variety of industries, including technology, life sciences, not-for-profit, professional services, financial services, property management, retail, manufacturing, and hospitality. Our clients execute annual service contracts with us that automatically renew. Generally, our clients may cancel these contracts with thirty days'

notice and we may cancel these contracts with thirty days' notice. 
We conduct our business primarily in the United States, with more than 99% of our total revenues being attributable to WSEs in the United States and its territories with the remainder being attributable to WSEs in Canada. Substantially all our long-lived assets are located in the United States.
Seasonality 
Our business is affected by seasonality in client business activity and WSE product selection. In addition, the timing of benefits open enrollment periods and utilization of medical services above each WSE's deductible causes variation in our quarterly results. Finally, clients generally change their payroll service providers at the beginning of the payroll tax year; as a result, we have historically experienced our highest volumes of new and exiting clients in the month of January. 
Competition 
We face competition from:

• | PEOs that compete directly with us,


• | HR and information systems departments and personnel of companies that administer employee benefits, payroll and HR for their companies in-house,


• | providers of certain endpoint HR services, including payroll, employee benefits, business process outsourcers with high-volume transaction and administrative capabilities, and other third-party administrators,


• | employee benefit exchanges that provide benefits administration services over the Internet to companies that otherwise maintain their own employee benefit plans, and


• | insurance brokers who allow third-party HR systems to integrate with their technology platform.

Our competitors include large PEOs such as the TotalSource unit of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., the PEO operations of Paychex, Inc. and Insperity, Inc., as well as specialized and smaller PEOs and similar HR service providers with PEO operations. To the extent that we and other companies providing these services are successful in growing our businesses, we anticipate that future competitors will enter this industry. 
We believe that our services are attractive to many SMBs in part because of our ability to provide access to a broad range of TriNet-sponsored workers' compensation, health insurance and other benefits programs on a cost-effective basis. We compete with insurance brokers and other providers of this coverage in this regard, and our offerings must be priced competitively with those provided by these competitors in order for us to attract and retain our clients.
We believe that we compete based upon the breadth and depth of our benefit plans, vertical market expertise, total cost of service, brand awareness and reputation, ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly, access to online and mobile solutions, and subject matter expertise. We believe that we are competitive across these factors. For additional information about our competition, please refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K, under the heading - Our reputation could suffer and our business could be adversely affected if our products do not perform, and our services are not delivered, as expected by our clients and WSEs.
Intellectual Property 
We own or license from third parties various computer software, as well as other intellectual property rights, used in our business. Generally, we protect our intellectual property rights through the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and policies with our employees and third-party partners and vendors. We also own registered trademarks in the United States, Canada and the European Union covering our name and other trademarks and logos that we believe are materially important to our operations.
Corporate Employees 
We refer to our employees that are not co-employed with our clients as our corporate employees. We had approximately 3,100 corporate employees as of December 31, 2018. Our corporate employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
