ITEM 1. BUSINESS



In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Nubia Brand International Corp.



Overview



Nubia Brand International Corp. is a newly organized blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination throughout this prospectus. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business or industry or geographic location, we intend to focus our search on wireless telecommunications companies.



On March 15, 2022, Nubia consummated its initial public offering of 12,350,000 units (the “Units”), including 1,350,000 units under the underwriters’ over-allotment option, with each unit consisting of one share of Nubia’s Class A common stock and one-half of one warrant, each whole warrant to purchase one share of Nubia’s Class A common stock. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $123,500,000. Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, Nubia consummated the private placement of 5,405,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant (the “Private Warrants”), generating total proceeds of $5,405,000. The private warrants are identical to the public warrants underlying the Units being sold in the initial public offering.



Following the consummation of the initial public offering, a total of $125,970,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of the Units in the initial public offering and the Private Warrants was deposited into a U.S.-based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination within the required time period or our entry into liquidation if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period. On May 2, 2022, our Class A common stock and warrants underlying the Units sold in our IPO began to trade separately on a voluntary basis.



If the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within 12 months, or March 15, 2023, (or up to 18 months, September 15, 2023, if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a business combination) from the closing of the IPO the Company is required to cease all operations, redeem the public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve.



Business Combination Agreement



On February 16, 2023, Nubia entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Honeycomb Battery Company, an Ohio corporation (the “Company” or “Honeycomb”), Nubia, and Nubia Merger Sub, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“Merger Sub”) and wholly-owned subsidiary of Nubia, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”) with the Company as the surviving corporation of the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nubia. In connection with the Merger, Nubia will change its name to “Honeycomb Battery Company” or such other name designated by the Company by notice to Nubia, which is referred to herein as the “Combined Company.” The board of directors of Nubia has unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby (collectively, the “Transactions”) and (ii) resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement and related matters by the stockholders of Nubia. 



The Merger Agreement provides for Nubia to issue to the Honeycomb shareholders aggregate consideration of 70,000,000 shares of the Combined Company’s common stock (the “Closing Merger Consideration Shares”) at the effective time of the Merger Agreement (the “Effective Time”), plus up to an additional 22,500,000 shares of the Combined Company’s common stock (the “Earnout Shares”) upon the occurrence of the following events (or earlier upon a change of control of Nubia but subject to (and only to the extent that) the valuation of Nubia common stock implied by such change of control transaction meeting the respective VWAP (as defined below) thresholds set forth below):




(i) | 5,000,000 Earnout Shares if, over any ten (10) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period from and after the date that is thirty (30) days following the closing date of the Transactions (the “Closing Date”) until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the VWAP of the shares of Nubia’s Class A common stock is greater than or equal to $12.50 per share (subject to any adjustment pursuant to the Merger Agreement);
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(ii) | 7,500,000 Earnout Shares if, over any ten (10) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period from and after the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date until the date that is forty-two (42) months following the Closing Date, the VWAP of the shares of Nubia’s Class A common stock is greater than or equal to $15.00 per share (subject to any adjustment pursuant to the Merger Agreement); and
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | 10,000,000 Earnout Shares if over any ten (10) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period from and after the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date until the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, the VWAP of the shares of Nubia’s Class A common stock is greater than or equal to $25.00 per share (subject to any adjustment pursuant to the Merger Agreement).
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




For purposes of the foregoing, “VWAP” means, for any security as of any date(s), the dollar volume-weighted average price for such security on the principal securities exchange or securities market on which such security is then traded during the period beginning at 9:30:01 a.m., New York time, and ending at 4:00:00 p.m., New York time, as reported by Bloomberg through its “HP” function (set to weighted average) or, if the foregoing does not apply, the dollar volume-weighted average price of such security in the over-the-counter market on the electronic bulletin board for such security during the period beginning at 9:30:01 a.m., New York time, and ending at 4:00:00 p.m., New York time, as reported by Bloomberg, or, if no dollar volume-weighted average price is reported for such security by Bloomberg for such hours, the average of the highest closing bid price and the lowest closing ask price of any of the market makers for such security as reported by OTC Markets Group Inc. If the VWAP cannot be calculated for such security on such date(s) on any of the foregoing bases, the VWAP of such security on such date(s) shall be the fair market value per share on such date(s) as reasonably determined by Nubia.



In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of Honeycomb’s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive its allocable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration Shares and the Earnout Shares, if any.



The Business Combination will require the approval of the shareholders of Nubia and Honeycomb and is subject to other customary closing conditions, including a proxy statement being filed with and cleared by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Transactions is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023.



Initial Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business until we complete a business combination. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of Private Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting our initial business combination.
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination



Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. Any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80% of fair market value test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.





2







We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as our initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.



Lack of Business Diversification



For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management Team



Although we scrutinized the management team of our target business, our assessment of the target business’ management team may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management team may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following our initial business combination remains to be determined. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we have encountered and will continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, and our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Facilities



Our executive offices are located at 13355 Noel Rd., Suite 1100, Dallas, Texas, and our telephone number is (972) 918-5120.



Employees



We have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary, in the exercise of their respective business judgement, to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We do not have an employment agreement with any member of our management team.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements



We have registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.

We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.



We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. Prior to the date of this prospectus, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.





5







Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.



Potential Conflicts



Members of our management team who directly or indirectly own our securities may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.



Our officers and directors have agreed to present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account, subject to any fiduciary or contractual obligations they may have. As more fully discussed in “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance — Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that might be attractive to any entity to which he has fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such initial business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such initial business combination opportunity to us. For more information on the relevant pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our management team, see the section titled “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance — Conflicts of Interest.”



Legal Proceedings



There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.
