ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 We are a self-advised real estate investment trust (“REIT”) focused on investing in and owning net-leased healthcare facilities across the U.S. and selectively in foreign jurisdictions. We have operated as a REIT since April 6, 2004, and accordingly, elected REIT status upon the filing of our calendar year 2004 federal income tax return. Medical Properties Trust, Inc. was incorporated under Maryland law on August 27, 2003, and MPT Operating Partnership, L.P. was formed under Delaware law on September 10, 2003. We conduct substantially all of our business through MPT Operating Partnership, L.P. We acquire and develop healthcare facilities and lease the facilities to healthcare operating companies under long-term net leases, which require the tenant to bear most of the costs associated with the property. We also make mortgage loans to healthcare operators collateralized by their real estate assets. In addition, we selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”), the proceeds of which are typically used for acquisition and working capital purposes. Finally, from time to time, we acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a right to share in such tenants’ profits and losses.
 Our investments in healthcare real estate, including mortgage and other loans, as well as any equity investments in our tenants are considered a single reportable segment as further discussed in Note 1 of Item 8 in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All of our investments are currently located in the U.S. and Europe. 
 At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our total assets were made up of the following (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 | 2018 | | | | 2017 | |

Portfolio of Properties
 As of February 22, 2019, our portfolio consisted of 276 properties: 255 facilities are leased to 29 tenants, three are under development, 10 are in the form of mortgage loans to four operators, and eight properties are not currently leased to a tenant, including six Adeptus Health, Inc. (“Adeptus Health”) transition properties, as discussed in Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Of the 276 properties, 80 facilities are owned by way of joint venture arrangements in which we hold a 50% ownership interest.  Our facilities consist of 160 general acute care hospitals, 102 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, and 14 long-term acute care hospitals (“LTACHs”).
 At February 22, 2019, no single property accounted for more than 3.7% of our total gross assets.
 Outlook and Strategy
 Our strategy is to lease the facilities that we acquire or develop to experienced healthcare operators pursuant to long-term net leases. Alternatively, we have structured certain of our investments as long-term, interest-only mortgage loans to healthcare operators, and we may make similar investments in the future. Our mortgage loans are structured such that we obtain similar economic returns as our net leases. In addition, we have obtained and will continue to obtain profits or other interests in certain of our tenants’ operations in order to enhance our overall return. The market for healthcare real estate is extensive and includes real estate owned by a variety of healthcare operators. We focus on acquiring and developing those net-leased facilities that are specifically designed to reflect the latest trends in healthcare delivery methods and that focus on the most critical components of healthcare. We typically invest in facilities that have the highest intensity of care including:

• | General acute care — provides inpatient care for the treatment of acute conditions and manifestations of chronic conditions. This type of facility also provides ambulatory care through hospital outpatient departments and emergency rooms.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inpatient rehabilitation — provides rehabilitation to patients with various neurological, musculoskeletal orthopedic and other medical conditions following stabilization of their acute medical issues.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | LTACHs — a specialty-care hospital designed for patients with serious medical problems that require intense, special treatment for an extended period of time, sometimes requiring a hospital stay averaging in excess of three weeks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diversification
 A fundamental component of our business plan is the continued diversification of our tenant relationships, the types of hospitals we own and the geographic areas in which we invest. From a tenant relationship perspective, see section titled “Significant Tenants” below for detail. See sections titled “Revenue by Property Type” and “Portfolio of Properties” above for information on the diversification of our hospital types. From a geographical perspective, we have investments across the U.S. and in Europe. See below for investment and revenue concentration in the U.S. and our global concentration at December 31, 2018(1):

(1) | On January 31, 2019, we announced the entering into definitive agreements to acquire 11 Australian hospitals from Healthscope for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $860 million. Pro forma for this transaction, our concentration in gross assets would be 77.2% and 22.8% for U.S. and International, respectively.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We continue to believe that Europe represents an attractive market in which to invest, particularly in Germany. Germany is an attractive investment opportunity for us given its strong macroeconomic position and healthcare environment. Germany’s Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”), which is approximately $3.7 trillion according to World Bank 2017 data, has been relatively more stable than other countries in the European Union due to Germany’s stable business practices and monetary policy. In addition to cultural influences, government policies emphasizing sound public finance and a significant presence of small and medium-sized enterprises (which employ 70% of the employment base) have also contributed to Germany’s strong and sustainable economic position. The above factors have contributed to an unemployment rate in Germany of 3.3% as of December 2018, which is significantly less than the 7.9% unemployment rate in the European Union as of December 2018, according to Eurostat.
 Underwriting/Asset Management
 Our revenue is derived from rents we earn pursuant to the lease agreements with our tenants, from interest income from loans to our tenants and other facility owners and from profits or equity interests in certain of our tenants’ operations. Our tenants operate in the healthcare industry, generally providing medical, surgical and rehabilitative care to patients. The capacity of our tenants to pay our rents and interest is dependent upon their ability to conduct their operations at profitable levels. We believe that the business 
 7

environment of the industry segments in which our tenants operate is generally positive for efficient operators. However, our tenants’ operations are subject to economic, regulatory and market conditions that may affect their profitability, which could impact our results. Accordingly, we monitor certain key performance indicators that we believe provides us with early indications of conditions that could affect the level of risk in our portfolio.
 Key factors that we consider in underwriting prospective tenants and in our ongoing monitoring of our tenants’ (and guarantors’) performance include the following: 
  
• | the scope and breadth of clinical services and programs, including utilization trends (both inpatient and outpatient) by service type;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the size and composition of medical staff and physician leadership at our facilities, including specialty, tenure and number of procedures performed and/or referrals;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an evaluation of our operator's administrative team, as applicable, including background and tenure within the healthcare industry;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | facility operating performance measured by current, historical and prospective operating margins (measured by a tenant's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, management fees and facility rent) of each tenant and at each facility;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ratio of our tenants' operating earnings to facility rent and to other fixed costs, including debt costs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in revenue sources of our tenants, including the relative mix of public payors (including Medicare, Medicaid/MediCal, and managed care in the U.S. as well as equivalent payors in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain) and private payors (including commercial insurance and private pay patients);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | trends in tenants' cash collections, including comparison to recorded net patient service revenues;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | tenants' free cash flow;
--+-------------------------


• | the potential impact of healthcare legislation and other regulations (including changes in reimbursement) on our tenants' profitability and liquidity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the potential impact of any legal, regulatory or compliance proceedings with our tenants;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an ongoing assessment of the operating environment of our tenants including demographics, competition, market position, status of compliance, accreditation, quality performance and health outcomes as measured by The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"), Joint Commission, and other governmental bodies; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the level of investment in the hospital infrastructure and health IT systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Healthcare Industry
 The delivery of healthcare services, whether in the U.S. or elsewhere, requires real estate and, as a consequence, healthcare providers depend on real estate to maintain and grow their businesses. We believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the:

• | compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

United States
 Healthcare is the single largest industry in the U.S. based on GDP. According to the National Health Expenditures report dated July 2017 by the CMS: (i) national health expenditures were projected to grow 5.3% in 2018; (ii) the average compound annual growth rate for national health expenditures, over the projection period of 2017 through 2026, is anticipated to be 5.5%; and (iii) the healthcare industry is projected to represent 19.7% of U.S. GDP by 2026.
Germany
 The healthcare industry is also the single largest industry in Germany. Behind only the U.S., Netherlands and France, Germany’s healthcare expenditures represent approximately 11.1% of its total GDP according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s 2014 data.
 8

The German rehabilitation market (which includes the majority of our facilities in Germany) serves a broader scope of treatment with over 1,233 rehabilitation facilities (compared to 1,165 in the U.S.) and 208.5 beds per 100,000 population (compared to 114.7 in the U.S.). Approximately 90% of the payments in the German healthcare system come from governmental sources. The largest payor category is the public pension fund system representing 39% of payments. Public health insurance and payments for government employees represent 46% of payments. The balance of the payments into the German rehabilitation market come from a variety of sources including private pay and private insurance. One particular focus area of investors in the German market is the healthcare industry because the German Social Code mandates universal access coverage and a high standard of care, thereby creating a robust healthcare dynamic in the country. Germany spends approximately 7.4% of health spending for inpatient facilities on prevention and rehabilitation facilities.
 United Kingdom
 Healthcare services in the United Kingdom are provided through the National Health Service (“NHS”). In 2016, the United Kingdom spent 9.8% of GDP on healthcare. The majority of this funding for the NHS comes from general taxation, and a smaller proportion from national insurance (a payroll tax). The NHS also receives income from copayments, people using NHS services as private patients, and some other minor sources. In 2015, 10.5% of the United Kingdom population had private voluntary health insurance provided mostly through employers. Private insurance offers more rapid and convenient access to care, especially for elective hospital procedures. It is estimated that four insurers account for 87.5% of the market, with small providers comprising the rest. The total private healthcare market is about £1.47 billion. Demand for private health insurance rose by 2.1% in 2015.
 Publicly owned hospitals are organized either as NHS trusts, approximately 72 in number or as foundation trusts, approximately 150 in number. NHS trusts are accountable to the Department of Health while foundation trusts enjoy greater freedom from central control. An estimated 548 private hospitals are located in the United Kingdom and offer a range of treatments. Their charges to private patients are not regulated, and they receive no public subsidies. NHS use of private hospitals remains low with about 3.6% of NHS funding used for this purpose. The NHS budget is projected to grow 1.1% between 2015 and 2021.
 Italy
 The Italian national health service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) is regionally based and organized at the national, regional, and local levels. Under the Italian constitution, responsibility for healthcare is shared by the national government and the 19 regions and two autonomous provinces. The central government controls the distribution of tax revenue for publicly financed health care and defines a national statutory benefits package to be offered to all residents in every region — the “Essential Levels of Care.” The 19 regions and two autonomous provinces have responsibility for the organization and delivery of health services through local health units.
 Public financing accounted for 76% of total health spending in 2014, with total expenditure standing at 8.9% of GDP in 2016. The public system is financed primarily through a corporate tax (approximately 35.6% of the overall funding in 2012) pooled nationally and allocated back to regions, typically the source region, and a fixed proportion of national value-added tax revenue (approximately 47.3% of the total in 2012) collected by the central government and redistributed to regions unable to raise sufficient resources to provide the Essential Levels of Care.
 In 2012, there were approximately 187,000 beds in public hospitals and 45,500 beds in private accredited hospitals. A diagnosis-related group-based prospective payment system operates across the country and accounts for most hospital revenue.
 Private health insurance plays a limited role in the health system, accounting for roughly 1% of total spending in 2014. Approximately six million people are covered by some form of voluntary insurance which generally covers services excluded under the Essential Levels of Care, to offer a higher standard of comfort and privacy in hospital facilities, and wider choice among public and private providers. Some private health insurance policies also cover copayments for privately provided services, or a daily rate of compensation during hospitalization. There are two types of private health insurance: corporate, where companies cover employees and sometimes their families; and non-corporate, with individuals buying insurance for themselves or their family.
 Depending on the region, public funds are allocated by local health units to public and accredited private hospitals. Rates paid to hospitals include all hospital costs including those of physicians. Funding for health is defined by the July 2014 Pact for Health which defines funding between $143.4 billion and $151.3 billion annually for the years 2014 to 2016.
 Spain
 The Spanish health system was established by the General Health Law of 1986. This law carries out a mandate of the Spanish Constitution, which establishes the right of all citizens to protection of their health. The National Health System (Sistema Nacional de Salud, SNS) is the administrative device set up by the law. Spain spent approximately 9.0% of its GDP on health care in 2016. 
 9

Expenditures for private healthcare are 26.4% of total health expenditures and have been growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 1.7%. Approximately 80% of all Spanish patients use a combination of both private and public healthcare services.
 In 2014, private hospitals comprised 55% of total Spanish hospitals. Specifically, private hospitals numbered 421 while public hospitals accounted for 343 of Spain’s total number of hospitals.
 Public expenditures on healthcare accounted for 5.9% of total public expenditures. They are projected to grow to 7.1% of total public expenditures by 2050. In 2015, public spending on healthcare reached €68 million, a significant increase from the €23 million spent in 1995.
 Our Leases and Loans
 The leases for our facilities are generally “net” leases with terms requiring the tenant to pay all ongoing operating and maintenance expenses of the facility, including property, casualty, general liability and other insurance coverages, utilities and other charges incurred in the operation of the facilities, as well as real estate and certain other taxes, ground lease rent (if any) and the costs of capital expenditures, repairs and maintenance (including any repairs mandated by regulatory requirements). Similarly, borrowers under our mortgage loan arrangements retain the responsibilities of ownership, including physical maintenance and improvements and all costs and expenses. Our leases and loans typically require our tenants to indemnify us for any past or future environmental liabilities. Our current leases and loans have a weighted average remaining initial lease or loan term of 12.7 years (see Item 2 for more information on remaining lease or loan terms) and most include renewal options at the election of our tenants.  Based on current monthly revenue, more than 96% of our leases and loans provide for annual rent or interest escalations based on increases in the consumer price index (“CPI”) and/or fixed minimum annual rent or interest escalations ranging from 0.5% to 3.0%. In some cases, our domestic leases and loans provide for escalations based on CPI subject to floors and/or ceilings. 
 RIDEA Investments
 We have made, and may make in the future, investments in certain of our tenants in the form of equity investments, loans (with equity like returns), or profit interests. Some of these investments fall under a structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”), which was signed into law under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Under the provisions of RIDEA, a REIT may lease “qualified health care properties” on an arm’s length basis to a TRS if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor.” We view RIDEA as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points. At December 31, 2018, our RIDEA investments totaled approximately $14.2 million.
 Significant Tenants
 At December 31, 2018, we had total assets of approximately $8.8 billion comprised of 275 healthcare properties (including 80 real estate facilities held in joint ventures) in 29 states, in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain. The properties are leased to or mortgaged by 29 different hospital operating companies. On a gross asset basis, as more fully described in the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), our top five tenants were as follows (dollars in thousands):

----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | With the Australian acquisition discussed in Note 13 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we expect to further diversify our concentration metrics including by operator. For instance, our concentration in Steward Health Care System LLC (“Steward”) would decrease to 38% of pro forma gross assets.

Steward
 Affiliates of Steward lease 41 facilities pursuant to one master lease agreement, which had an initial 15-year term (ending in October 2031) with three five-year extension options, plus annual inflation-based escalators. At December 31, 2018, these facilities had an average remaining initial lease term of 12.8 years. In addition to the master lease, we hold a mortgage loan on two facilities with terms and provisions that produce economic results in terms of day-to-day cash flows that are similar to those of our master lease agreement. The master lease agreement includes extension options that must include all or none of the master leased properties, cross default provisions for the leases, and a right of first refusal for the repurchase of the leased properties. The master loan agreement has independent extension options for each property and does not provide comparable cross default provisions. At December 31, 2018, we hold a 9.9% equity investment in Steward for $150 million.
Prime
 Affiliates of Prime Healthcare Services, Inc. (“Prime”) lease 22 facilities pursuant to five master lease agreements. Four of the master leases have initial fixed terms of 10 years and contain two renewal options of five years each. The fifth master lease is for 15 years and contains three renewal options for five years each. Rent escalates each year based on the CPI increase, with a 2% minimum floor. At the end of the initial or any renewal term, Prime must exercise any available extension or purchase option with respect to all or none of the leased and mortgaged properties relative to each master lease. The master leases include repurchase options, including provisions establishing minimum repurchase prices equal to our total investment. At December 31, 2018, these facilities had an average remaining initial fixed term of 6 years. In addition to leases, we hold mortgage loans on three facilities owned by affiliates of Prime. The terms and provisions of these loans are generally equivalent to the terms and provisions of our Prime lease arrangements.
Median
 Affiliates of Median Kliniken S.à r.l.(“MEDIAN”) lease 80 facilities (71 of which are owned by a joint venture arrangement – see Note 3 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) pursuant to six master lease agreements. None of the master lease agreements have renewal or repurchase options. The annual escalators for three of the master leases provide for increases of the greater of 1% or 70% of the change in German CPI. The lease term for these master leases ends in November 2044 for three of the facilities, December 2042 for three of the facilities, and August 2045 for three of the facilities. The 71-facility joint venture arrangement portfolio is leased to MEDIAN pursuant to the three remaining master lease agreements. The annual escalator for one master lease, representing 15 facilities, provided for a fixed increase of 2% through 2017 and provides for additional fixed increases of 0.5% each year thereafter. In addition, at December 31, 2020 and every three years thereafter, rent will be increased, if needed, by the positive difference between 1.5% and 70% of the change in German CPI during the review period. This master lease had an approximate 27-year fixed term ending in November 2040. The annual escalators for the other two master leases that cover the remaining facilities in the joint venture arrangement provide for increases of the greater of 1% or 70% of the change in German CPI. The lease terms for these remaining leases end in December 2042 for 36 of the facilities and August 2043 for 20 of the facilities.
 LifePoint
 Affiliates of LifePoint lease seven facilities (five of which are leased pursuant to a master lease agreement). The master lease agreement had an initial fixed 13.5-year term with four five-year extension options, plus annual consumer price-indexed increases, limited to a 2% floor and a 4% ceiling. The extension options may be exercised with respect to any or all of the properties. At the end of the fixed term and during any exercised extension options, the lessee will have the right of first refusal to purchase the leased property. At December 31, 2018, these facilities had an average remaining initial fixed lease term of 10.2 years. In addition to the master lease, two facilities are leased pursuant to stand-alone leases with a weighted average remaining fixed term of 10.1 years. The terms and provisions of these leases are generally equivalent to the terms and provisions of the master lease agreement.
  Ernest
 Affiliates of Ernest Health, Inc. (“Ernest”) lease 25 facilities pursuant to a master lease agreement and two stand-alone lease agreements. The original master lease agreement entered into in 2012, covering 19 properties, had a 20-year initial fixed term with three five-year extension options and provides for annual consumer price-indexed increases, limited to a 2% floor and 5% ceiling. At December 31, 2018, these facilities had a remaining initial fixed lease term of 13.2 years. This master lease includes purchase options that allow the lessee to purchase the leased property at an option price equal to the greater of fair market value of the lease property or the lease base increased by an amount equal to the annual rate of increase in the CPI on each adjustment date. All leases and loans are cross-defaulted, including the mortgage loans. In addition to the original master lease, Ernest affiliates lease two other properties pursuant to two separate stand-alone leases. At December 31, 2018, one facility (with a 15-year initial fixed term ending March 2033) had a remaining initial fixed lease term of 14.2 years and one facility (with a 20-year initial fixed term ending June 2035) had a remaining initial fixed lease term of 16.5 years. Each stand-alone lease has three five-year extension options and provides for annual consumer price-indexed increases, limited to a 2% floor and 4% ceiling. The mortgage loans mature in 2032, and the terms and provisions of these loans are generally equivalent to the terms and provisions of the original master lease agreement.
 11

 No other tenant accounted for more than 3.7% of our total gross assets at December 31, 2018.
 Environmental Matters
 Under various U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and similar international laws, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant of real estate may be required to remediate hazardous or toxic substance releases or threats of releases. There may also be certain obligations and liabilities on property owners with respect to asbestos containing materials. Investigation, remediation and monitoring costs may be substantial. The confirmed presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent that property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral and may adversely impact our investment in that property. Generally, prior to completing any acquisition or closing any mortgage loan, we obtain Phase I environmental assessments (or similar studies outside the U.S.) in order to attempt to identify potential environmental concerns at the facilities. These assessments are carried out in accordance with an appropriate level of due diligence and generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property’s chain of title and review of historic aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property. We may also conduct limited subsurface investigations and test for substances of concern where the results of the Phase I environmental assessments or other information indicates possible contamination or where our consultants recommend such procedures. Upon closing and for the remainder of the lease or loan term, our transaction documents require our tenants to repair and remediate environmental issues at the applicable facility, and to comply in full with all environmental laws and regulations.
California Seismic Standards
 Existing law, the Alfred E. Alquist Hospital Facilities Seismic Safety Act of 1983 (“Alquist Act”), establishes, under the jurisdiction of the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (“OSHPD”), a program of seismic safety building standards for certain hospitals constructed on and after March 7, 1973. The law requires the California Building Standards Commission to adopt earthquake performance categories, seismic evaluation procedures, standards and timeframes for upgrading certain facilities, and seismic retrofit building standards. This legislation was adopted to avoid the loss of life and the disruption of operations and the provision of emergency medical services that may result from structural damage sustained to hospitals resulting from an earthquake.  A violation of any provision of the act is a misdemeanor.
 Under the Alquist Act and related rules and regulations, all general acute care hospital buildings in California are assigned a structural performance category (“SPC”). SPC ratings range from 1 to 5 with SPC-1 assigned to buildings that may be at risk of collapse during a strong earthquake and SPC 5 assigned to buildings reasonably capable of providing services to the public following a strong earthquake. State law requires all SPC-1 buildings to be removed from providing general acute care services by 2020 and all SPC-2 buildings to be removed from providing general acute care services by 2030, in each case unless the facility is seismically retrofit so that it is in substantial compliance with the seismic safety regulations and standards developed by OSHPD.
 In 2017, the OSHPD adopted a new performance category that will allow hospitals to explore the possibilities of upgrading nonconforming buildings to a new performance level that is not as rigorous. Under SPC-4D, buildings undergoing a retrofit to this level can continue functioning indefinitely beyond 2030.
 The recent California AB 2190 bill (effective January 1, 2019) requires OSHPD to grant an additional extension of time to an owner who is subject to the January 1, 2020, deadline if specified conditions are met. The bill authorizes the additional extension to be until July 1, 2022, if the compliance plan is based upon replacement or retrofit or up to 5 years if the compliance plan is for a rebuild.
 Owners of general acute care hospital buildings that are classified as nonconforming must submit reports to OSHPD describing the status of each building in complying with the extension provisions, and to annually update OSHPD with any changes or adjustments.
 As of December 31, 2018, we have 10 licensed hospitals in California totaling investments of approximately $507 million, which excludes investments of $15.8 million of medical office buildings not subject to OSHPD standards.
 Exclusive of one hospital granted an OSHPD extension to 2020, all of our California hospitals are seismically compliant through 2030 as determined by OSHPD. For the one hospital granted an extension, we expect full compliance by the 2020 deadline unless an additional extension is sought under California AB 2190 to July 1, 2022.
 It is noted that under our current agreements, our tenants are responsible for capital expenditures in connection with seismic laws. We do not expect California seismic standards to have a negative impact on our financial condition or cash flows. We also do not expect compliance with California seismic standards to materially impact the financial condition of our tenants.

Competition
 We compete in acquiring and developing facilities with financial institutions, other lenders, real estate developers, healthcare operators, other REITs, other public and private real estate companies, and private real estate investors. Among the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete are the following:

• | we may have less knowledge than our competitors of certain markets in which we seek to invest in or develop facilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | some of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we have;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | some of our competitors may have lower costs of capital than we do;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our competitors or other entities may pursue a strategy similar to ours; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | some of our competitors may have existing relationships with our potential customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To the extent that we experience vacancies in our facilities, we will also face competition in leasing those facilities to prospective tenants. The actual competition for tenants varies depending on the characteristics of each local market. Virtually all of our facilities operate in highly competitive environments, and patients and referral sources, including physicians, may change their preferences for healthcare facilities from time to time. The operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties that provide comparable services. Operators compete for patients based on a number of factors including quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of a facility, location, services offered, physicians, staff, and price. We also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants, such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services.
 For additional information, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Insurance
 Our leases and mortgage loans require our tenants to carry property, loss of income, general liability, professional liability, and other insurance coverages in order to protect our interests. We monitor the adequacy of such coverages on an ongoing basis. In addition, we maintain separate insurance that provides coverage for bodily injury and property damage to third parties arising from our ownership of the healthcare facilities that are leased to and occupied by our tenants, as well as contingent business interruption insurance. At December 31, 2018, we believe that the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, and standard industry practice.
Healthcare Regulatory Matters
 The following discussion describes certain material federal healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our operations and those of our tenants. The discussion, however, does not address all applicable federal healthcare laws, and does not address state healthcare laws and regulations, except as otherwise indicated. These state laws and regulations, like the federal healthcare laws and regulations, could affect the operations of our tenants and, accordingly, our operations. In addition, in some instances we own a minority interest in our tenants’ operations and, in addition to the effect on our tenant’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us, our ownership and investment returns may also be negatively impacted by such laws and regulations. Moreover, the discussion relating to reimbursement for healthcare services addresses matters that are subject to frequent review and revision by Congress and the agencies responsible for administering federal payment programs. Consequently, predicting future reimbursement trends or changes, along with the potential impact to us, is inherently difficult and imprecise.  Finally, though we have not included a discussion of applicable foreign laws or regulations, our tenants in the United Kingdom and Western Europe may be subject to similar laws and regulations governing the ownership or operation of healthcare facilities including, without limitation, laws governing patient care and safety, reimbursement, licensure, and data protection.  
 Ownership and operation of hospitals and other healthcare facilities are subject, directly and indirectly, to substantial U.S. federal, state, and local government healthcare laws, rules, and regulations. Our tenants’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. Physician investment in our facilities or in joint ventures to own real estate also will be subject to such laws and regulations. Although we are not a healthcare provider or in a position to influence the referral of patients or ordering of items and services reimbursable by the federal government, to the extent that a healthcare provider engages in transactions with our tenants, such as sublease or other financial arrangements, the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law (both discussed in this section) could be implicated. Our leases and mortgage loans require our tenants to comply with all applicable laws, including healthcare laws. We intend for all of our business activities and operations to conform in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including healthcare laws, rules, and regulations.

Applicable Laws
 Anti-Kickback Statute. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)) prohibits, among other things, the offer, payment, solicitation, or acceptance of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for referring an individual to a provider of items or services for which payment may be made in whole, or in part, under a federal healthcare program, including the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a crime, punishable by fines of up to $100,000 per violation, ten years imprisonment, or both. Violations may also result in civil sanctions, including civil monetary penalties of up to $50,000 per violation, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and additional monetary penalties in amounts treble to the underlying remuneration. The Anti-Kickback Statute is an intent based statute, however, it has been broadly interpreted. As an example, courts have held that there is a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute if just one purpose of an arrangement is to generate referrals despite the fact that there may be one or more other lawful purposes to the arrangement at issue.
 The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services has issued “Safe Harbor Regulations” that describe practices that will not be considered violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute. Nonetheless, the fact that a particular arrangement does not meet safe harbor requirements does not also mean that the arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. Rather, the safe harbor regulations simply provide a guaranty that qualifying arrangements will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. We intend to use commercially reasonable efforts to structure our arrangements involving facilities, so as to satisfy, or meet as closely as possible, all safe harbor conditions. We cannot assure you, however, that we will meet all the conditions for an applicable safe harbor.
 Physician Self-Referral Statute (“Stark Law”). Any physicians investing in us or our subsidiary entities could also be subject to the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989, or the Stark Law (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1395nn). Unless subject to an exception, the Stark Law prohibits a physician from making a referral to an “entity” furnishing “designated health services” (which would include, without limitation, certain inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical laboratory services, and radiology services) paid by Medicare or Medicaid if the physician or a member of his immediate family has a “financial relationship” with that entity. A reciprocal prohibition bars the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for any services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, refunding amounts received for services provided pursuant to prohibited referrals, civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per prohibited service provided, and exclusion from the participation in federal healthcare programs. The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $100,000 for a circumvention scheme.
 There are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including, without limitation, employment contracts, rental of office space or equipment, personal services agreements and recruitment agreements. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law imposes strict liability on the parties to an arrangement and an arrangement must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law.
 CMS has issued multiple phases of final regulations implementing the Stark Law and continues to make changes to these regulations. While these regulations help clarify the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear how the government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes. Although our lease and loan agreements require lessees and borrowers to comply with the Stark Law, and we intend for facilities to comply with the Stark Law, we cannot offer assurance that the arrangements entered into by us and our facilities will be found to be in compliance with the Stark Law, as it ultimately may be implemented or interpreted. In addition, changes to the Stark Law could require our tenants to restructure certain arrangements with physicians, which could impact the business of our tenants.
 False Claims Act. The federal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of any false claim for payment to the federal government; it is the civil equivalent to federal criminal provisions prohibiting the submission of false claims to federally funded programs. Additionally, qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the federal False Claims Act allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. Whistleblowers may collect a portion of the federal government’s recovery — an incentive for private parties to bring such actions. A successful federal False Claims Act case may result in a penalty of three times the actual damages, plus additional civil penalties payable to the government, plus reimbursement of the fees of counsel for the whistleblower. Many states have enacted similar statutes preventing the presentation of a false claim to a state government, and we expect more to do so because the Social Security Act provides a financial incentive for states to enact statutes establishing state level liability.
 The Civil Monetary Penalties Law. The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMPL”) is a comprehensive statute that covers an array of fraudulent and abusive activities and is very similar to the False Claims Act. Among other things, the CMPL law prohibits the knowing presentation of a claim for certain healthcare services that is false or fraudulent, the presentation of false or misleading information in connection with claims for payment, and other acts involving fraudulent conduct. Violation of the CMPL may result in penalties ranging from $20,000 to $100,000.  Notably, such penalties apply to each instance of prohibited conduct, including, for example, each item or service not provided as claimed, and each provision of false information or each false record.  In addition, violators of the CMPL may be penalized up to three times the amount unlawfully claimed and may be excluded from participation in federal health care programs. 
 14

Licensure. Our tenants and borrowers under mortgage loans are subject to extensive U.S. federal, state, and local licensure, certification, and inspection laws and regulations including, in some cases, certificate of need laws. Further, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials, and operate equipment. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of licensure, certification or accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, and suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs.
 EMTALA. Our tenants and borrowers under mortgage loans that provide emergency care are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). Regardless of an individual’s ability to pay, this federal law requires such healthcare facilities to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition.  Liability for violations of EMTALA are severe and include, among other things, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the federal healthcare programs. Our lease and mortgage loan agreements require our tenants to comply with EMTALA, and we believe our tenants conduct business in substantial compliance with EMTALA.
 Reimbursement Pressures. Healthcare facility operating margins continue to face significant pressure due to the deterioration in pricing flexibility and payor mix, a shift toward alternative payment models, increases in operating expenses that exceed increases in payments under the Medicare program, reductions in levels of Medicaid funding due to state budget shortfalls, and other similar cost pressures on our tenants. More specifically, certain facilities and departments such as LTACHs and HOPDs face reimbursement pressures because of legislative and regulatory restrictions and limitations on reimbursement. We cannot predict how and to what extent these or other initiatives will impact the business of our tenants or whether our business will be adversely impacted.
 Healthcare Reform. Generally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Reform Law”) provides for expanded health insurance coverage through tax subsidies and federal health insurance programs, individual and employer mandates for health insurance coverage, and health insurance exchanges. The Reform Law also includes various cost containment initiatives, including quality control and payment system refinements for federal programs, such as pay-for-performance criteria and value-based purchasing programs, bundled provider payments, accountable care organizations, geographic payment variations, comparative effectiveness research, and lower payments for hospital readmissions. The Reform Law also increases health information technology (“HIT”) standards for healthcare providers in an effort to improve quality and reduce costs. The Reform Law has led to significant changes in the healthcare system. We believe the Reform Law will continue to lead to changes in healthcare delivery and reimbursement for years to come, and it is likely that certain trends that have been in place since the passage of the Reform Law, such as development and implementation of cost containment initiatives, increased use of HIT and pressure on reimbursement, will continue irrespective of any future repeal efforts. We cannot predict the continued impact of the Reform Law or the impact of future repeal efforts on our business, as some aspects benefit the operations of our tenants, while other aspects present challenges.
Employees
 We have 77 employees as of February 22, 2019. As we continue to grow, we expect our head count to increase as well. However, we do not believe that any adjustments to the number of employees will have a material effect on our operations or to general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are members of any union.
