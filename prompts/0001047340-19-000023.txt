Item 1. Business
History and Development of Fresh Del Monte
Our legal name is Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc., and our commercial name is Del Monte Fresh Produce. We are an exempted holding company, incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands on August 29, 1996. At December 28, 2018, the close of our most recent fiscal year, members of the Abu-Ghazaleh family directly owned approximately 36.5% of our outstanding Ordinary Shares.
Our principal executive office is located at 190 Elgin Avenue, George Town, Grand Cayman, KY1-9005, Cayman Islands. The address of our U.S. executive office is Del Monte Fresh Produce Company, 241 Sevilla Avenue, Coral Gables, Florida 33134. Our telephone number at our U.S. executive office is (305) 520-8400. Our Internet address is http://www.freshdelmonte.com. The electronic version of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, along with other information about us, our operations and our results and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) can be found on our Website. Information on our Website is not a part of this Report on Form 10-K.

Our global business, conducted through our subsidiaries, is primarily the worldwide sourcing, transportation and marketing of fresh and fresh-cut produce together with prepared food products in Europe, North America, Africa and the Middle East. We source our fresh produce products (bananas, pineapples, melons, tomatoes, grapes, apples, pears, peaches, plums, nectarines, cherries, citrus, avocados, kiwis, blueberries and strawberries) primarily from Central and South America, Africa, the Philippines, North America and Europe.  We can also produce, market and distribute certain prepared food products in North America based on our agreement with Del Monte Pacific Limited and its subsidiary Del Monte Foods, Inc. We source our prepared food products primarily from Africa, Europe and the Middle East.  Our products are sourced from company-owned operations, through joint venture arrangements and through supply contracts with independent producers.  We distribute our products in North America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America.
On February 26, 2018, we acquired Mann Packing Co., Inc. ("Mann Packing") by purchasing all of its outstanding capital stock for an aggregate consideration of $357.2 million. This acquisition was funded by a three-day promissory note of $229.7 million, entered into at the seller's request, and cash of $127.5 million. The three-day promissory note was settled with cash on hand and additional borrowing under our credit facility. Mann Packing is an award-winning innovator and leading grower, processor and supplier of a broad variety of fresh and value-added vegetable products in North America. Mann Packing's strength in the vegetable category, one of the fastest growing fresh food segments, allows us to diversify our business, leverage our distribution network and infrastructure and increase our market reach. In addition, this transaction has provided us with synergies, enhancing our ability to better serve our combined customers and address consumers' needs for healthier products. 
On May 7, 2018, we acquired a 10% equity interest in Three Limes, Inc. d/b/a The Purple Carrot ("Purple Carrot"), a plant-based meal kit provider in the United States, for $4.2 million. Our investment was funded using operating cash flows and available borrowings under our credit facility. This investment builds on our commitment to seize growth opportunities that will further diversify our business, leverage our distribution network and infrastructure, and get healthful, fresh fruit and vegetables in as many channels as possible. 
In June 2018, we acquired a 70% interest in an herb farm in Jordan for $1.7 million as part of our diversification strategy. This acquisition was funded using operating cash flows and available borrowings under our credit facility. 

Our capital expenditures totaled $150.5 million in 2018. Approximately $29.9 million of our 2018 capital expenditures were related to the banana segment. Banana segment capital expenditures consisted primarily of $16.4 million of expansion and improvements to our production facilities in Central America including our continuing development of our new Panama operation and $6.4 million in expansions and improvements to our Philippines operations. The remaining $7.1 million in our banana related capital expenditures were primarily for improvements to our distribution centers and for information technology systems. Approximately $67.5 million of our 2018 capital expenditures were related to the other fresh produce segment. This consisted of approximately $25.8 million for expansion and improvements to the Mann Packing facilities, including the construction of the new manufacturing plant in Gonzales, California; $9.6 million for a new avocado packing and sorting facility in Mexico; $8.4 million for improvements to our non-tropical fruit operations in Chile and $6.7 million on improvements to our pineapple operations in Costa Rica and Philippines. The remaining $17.0 million in capital expenditures related to the other fresh produce segment consists primarily of expansion and improvements to our fresh-cut facilities and information technology initiatives. Approximately $15.6 million of our 2018 capital expenditures relate to the prepared food segment, consisting primarily of improvements and 
 1

expansion to our Kenya, Greece, Mann Packing and Jordan prepared food operations. Also included in capital expenditures for 2018 were approximately $37.5 million for progress payments for the construction of six new refrigerated container ships. 

Our capital expenditures totaled $138.5 million in 2017. Approximately $61.0 million of our 2017 capital expenditures were related to the banana segment. Banana segment capital expenditures consisted primarily of approximately $28.7 million for expansion of our production operations in the Philippines and approximately $17.3 million for expansion and improvements to our production operations in Central America. The remainder of our banana segment capital expenditures of approximately $15.0 million were principally for expansion and improvements to our distribution centers in North America and the Middle East and for information technology expenditures. Approximately $66.9 million of our 2017 capital expenditures were related to the other fresh produce segment. This consisted principally of $18.9 million for expansion of pineapple operations in Costa Rica and the Philippines and $9.6 million for expansion and improvements to our non-tropical fruit operation in Chile. Also, included in our capital expenditures for the other fresh produce segment in 2017 were approximately $24.7 million for expansion and improvements to our fresh-cut and distribution facilities in North America and $13.7 million for improvements and expansion to our distribution and production facilities in the Middle East and Asia. Approximately $10.6 million of our 2017 capital expenditures were related to our prepared food segment, consisting principally of improvements to our production facilities in Kenya and the Middle East. 
The principal capital expenditures planned for 2019 consist primarily of expansion and improvement of production facilities in North America, principally for our newly acquired Mann Packing business, combined with production facilities in Costa Rica, the Philippines, Chile, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Kenya and Jordan. We also plan capital expenditures for expansion and improvements of our distribution and fresh-cut facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia. In addition, as part of our ship building program entered into in 2017 and 2018, we expect to make additional payments on the construction of our six new refrigerated container ships that are scheduled to be delivered commencing in 2020. We anticipate that this ship building program will lead to the replacement of our entire United States east coast fleet of ships. 
Business Overview

We are one of the world’s leading vertically integrated producers, marketers and distributors of high-quality fresh and fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, as well as a leading producer and distributor of prepared fruit and vegetables, juices, beverages and snacks in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. We market our products worldwide under the DEL MONTE® brand, a symbol of product innovation, quality, freshness and reliability since 1892. Our global sourcing and logistics network allows us to provide consistent delivery of high-quality fresh produce, juices, beverages, processed fruit and vegetables and value-added services to our customers.

We have leading market positions in the following product categories. We believe we are:

• | the largest marketer of fresh pineapples worldwide;


• | the third-largest marketer of bananas worldwide;


• | a leading marketer of branded fresh-cut fruit in the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia;


• | a leading marketer of fresh and fresh-cut vegetable products in North America;


• | a leading year-round marketer of branded grapes in the United States;


• | a leading marketer of avocados in the United States;


• | a leading marketer of branded non-tropical fruit in selected markets; and


• | a leading marketer for branded canned fruit in the European Union (the "EU"), other European markets and the Middle East.

We source and distribute our fresh produce products globally. Our products are grown primarily in Central and South America, Africa and the Philippines. We also source products from North America and Europe. Our products are sourced from company-controlled farms and independent growers. At year end 2018, we transported our fresh produce to markets using our fleet of nine owned and seven chartered refrigerated ships, and we operated four port facilities in the United States. We also operated 47 distribution centers, generally with cold storage and banana ripening facilities in our key markets worldwide, including the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, Germany and France. We also operate 
 2

22 fresh-cut facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, some of which are located within our distribution centers. Through our vertically integrated network, we manage the transportation and distribution of our products in a continuous temperature-controlled environment. This enables us to preserve quality and freshness, and to optimize product shelf life, while ensuring timely and year-round distribution. Furthermore, our position as a volume producer and shipper of bananas allows us to lower our average per-box logistics cost and to provide regular deliveries of our premium fresh fruit to meet the increasing demand for year-round supply.
We market and distribute our products to retail stores, club stores, convenience stores, wholesalers, distributors and foodservice operators in more than 80 countries around the world. North America is our largest market, accounting for 64% of our net sales in 2018. Europe, the Middle East and Asia regions are our other major markets, accounting for 15%, 10% and 10% of our net sales in 2018, respectively. Our distribution centers and fresh-cut facilities address the growing demand from supermarket chains, club stores, convenience stores, foodservice providers, mass merchandisers and independent grocers to provide value-added services, including the preparation of fresh-cut produce, ripening, customized sorting and packing, just-in-time and direct-store-delivery and in-store merchandising and promotional support. Large national and global chains are increasingly choosing fewer suppliers who can serve all of their needs on a national basis. We believe that there is a significant opportunity for a company like ours with a full fresh and fresh-cut produce line, a well-recognized brand, a consistent supply of quality produce and a national distribution network to become the preferred supplier to these large retail and convenience store chains, and foodservice customers. We believe that we are uniquely positioned as a preferred supplier, and our goal is to expand this status by increasing our leading position in fresh-cut produce, expanding our fresh fruit and vegetable business, continuing to grow these value-added products and diversifying our other fresh produce selections. We are a multinational company offering a variety of fresh produce in all major markets along with fresh-cut fruit and vegetables in selected markets and a prepared food product line that includes prepared fruit and vegetables, juices, beverages and snacks in Europe, North America, the Middle East and Africa.
Our strategy is a combination of maximizing revenues from our existing infrastructure, entering new markets and strict cost control initiatives. We plan to continue to capitalize on the growing global demand for fresh produce and expand our reach into existing and new markets. We expect sales growth of fresh produce in key markets by increasing our sales volume and per unit sales prices as permitted by market conditions. Our strategy includes increasing volumes from existing production and distribution facilities in order to improve operating efficiencies and reduce per unit costs. We plan additional investments in production facilities in order to expand our product offering in established markets and continue with our recent expansion in growth markets, such as the Middle East and Africa. We also plan additional investments in our North America, Middle East and Europe distribution and fresh-cut fruit and vegetables facilities to support our planned growth in these markets and expansion of production facilities at our recently acquired Mann Packing fresh and fresh-cut vegetable products operation in California. 

Products Sourcing and Production

Our products are grown and sourced primarily in Central and South America, North America and the Philippines. We also source products from Europe and Africa. In 2018, 45% of the fresh produce we sold was grown on company-controlled farms and the remaining 55% was acquired primarily through supply contracts with independent growers. Costa Rica is our most significant sourcing location representing approximately 34% of our total sales volume of fresh produce products and where 36% of our property, plant and equipment was located in 2018.
We produce, source, distribute and market a broad array of fresh produce throughout the world, primarily under the DEL MONTE® brand, as well as under other proprietary brands, such as UTC® and Rosy®. We also produce, distribute and market prepared fruits and vegetables, juices, beverages and snacks under the DEL MONTE® brand, as well as other proprietary brands, such as Fruit Express®, Just Juice®, Fruitini® and other regional trademarks in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
As a result of our acquisition of Mann Packing in 2018, we also distribute under Mann's family of brands such as Mann's®, Arcadian Harvest®, Nourish®, Broccolini®, Caulilini®, Better Burger Leaf® and RomaLeaf & Blend®.

Bananas
Bananas are the leading internationally traded fresh fruit in terms of volume and dollar sales and one of the best-selling fresh fruits in the United States.  Europe and North America are the world’s largest banana markets and the Middle East has now surpassed Asia as the third largest market. Bananas are a key produce department product due to its high turnover and the premium margins obtained by retailers. 
Bananas have a relatively short growing cycle and are grown in tropical locations with humid climates and heavy rainfall, such as Central and South America, the Caribbean, the Philippines and Africa. Bananas are grown throughout the year in these locations, although demand and prices fluctuate based on the relative supply of bananas and the availability of seasonal and alternative fruit.

We believe that we are the world’s third-largest marketer of bananas, based on internally generated data.  Our banana sales in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East accounted for approximately 54%, 18%, 20% and 9% of our net sales of bananas in 2018, respectively. We produced approximately 38% of the banana volume we sold in 2018 on company-controlled farms, and we purchased the remainder from independent growers.
Bananas are one of the best-selling fresh produce items, as well as a high-margin product for many of our customers. Accordingly, our ability to provide our customers with a year-round supply of high-quality DEL MONTE® bananas is important to maintaining our existing customer relationships and attracting new customers. Our position as a volume shipper of bananas has also allowed us to make regular shipments of a wide array of other fresh produce, such as pineapples, melons and plantains, reducing our average per-box logistics costs and maintaining higher quality produce with a longer shelf life.

We produce bananas on company-controlled farms in Costa Rica, Guatemala, the Philippines and Brazil and we purchase bananas from independent growers in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Colombia, Guatemala and the Philippines.  Although our supply contracts are primarily long-term, we also make purchases in the spot market, primarily in Ecuador. In Ecuador and Costa Rica, 
 4

there are minimum export prices for the sale of bananas which are established and reviewed on a periodic basis by the respective governments.
In 2017, we entered into a contract with the Republic of Panama and will invest a minimum of $100.0 million over a period of seven years which includes the development of approximately 4,000 hectares of leased land suitable for banana production. This investment significantly increases our company-controlled banana production. We expect commercial production to gradually commence in 2019 and continue to increase until full production is reached in 2023.
We purchase the majority of our bananas in the Philippines through long-term contracts with independent growers. Approximately 73% of our Philippine-sourced bananas are supplied by one grower, representing 12% of the Philippines banana industry volume in 2018.  In the Philippines, we have leased approximately 5,100 hectares of land where we have planted approximately 4,100 hectares of bananas for the Asia and the Middle East markets.

Gold Pineapples
 Pineapples are grown in tropical and sub-tropical locations, including the Philippines, Costa Rica, Hawaii, Thailand, Malaysia, Brazil, Indonesia and various countries in Africa. In contrast to bananas, pineapples have a long growing cycle of 18 months, and require re-cultivation after one to two harvests. Pineapple growing requires a higher level of capital investment, as well as greater agricultural expertise as compared to growing bananas.
The premium pineapples, such as our Del Monte Gold® Extra Sweet pineapple, which has an enhanced taste, golden shell color and bright yellow flesh, has replaced the Champaka and other traditional pineapple varieties in popularity and demand and has led to increased competition.

We believe that we are the leading marketer of fresh pineapples worldwide, based on internally generated data.   Pineapple sales in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East accounted for 63%, 20%, 13% and 4%, respectively, of our net sales of pineapples in 2018.  From 1996 to 2018, our volume of the Del Monte Gold® Extra Sweet pineapple increased from 2.5 million boxes to 29.6 million boxes. Worldwide, our pineapple sales volumes increased by 2% during the past year.

 The principal production and procurement areas for our gold pineapples are Costa Rica and the Philippines. Given the complexity of pineapple cultivation relative to our bananas, a higher percentage of the fresh pineapples we sell (80% by volume in 2018) is produced on company-controlled farms.
Fresh-Cut Produce (Fruit and Vegetables)

Fresh-cut produce first gained prominence in many U.S. and European markets with the introduction of washed and cut vegetables. While packaged salads continue to lead the category of fresh-cut produce sales, the category has expanded significantly to include pineapples, melons, mangoes, grapes, citrus and assorted vegetable produce items that are washed, cut and packaged in a ready-to-use form. Market expansion has been driven largely by consumer demand for convenient, fresh, healthy and ready-to-eat food alternatives, as well as significant demand from foodservice operators. Within this market, we believe that there has been increasing differentiation between companies active primarily in the packaged salad market and other companies, like us, that can offer a wide variety of value-added fresh-cut fruit and vegetable items.

The majority of fresh-cut produce is sold to consumers through retail and club store settings, as well as non-conventional settings such as convenience stores, gas stations and airports. We believe that outsourcing by food retailers will increase, particularly as food safety regulations become more stringent and retailers demand more value-added services. We believe that this trend should benefit large branded suppliers like us, who are better positioned to invest in state-of-the-art fresh-cut facilities and food safety systems and to service regional, national and global chains and foodservice operators, as well as supercenters, mass merchandisers, club stores and convenience stores. We also believe that large branded suppliers benefit from merchandising, branding and other marketing strategies for fresh-cut products, similar to those used for branded processed food products, which depend substantially on product differentiation.

We believe that the fresh-cut produce market continues to be one of the fastest-growing categories in the fresh produce segment, largely due to consumer trends favoring healthy and conveniently packaged ready-to-eat foods. We established a platform in this industry through acquisitions and by building upon our existing fresh-cut pineapple business. We believe that our experience in this market coupled with our sourcing and logistics capabilities and the DEL MONTE® brand have enabled us to achieve a leading position in this highly fragmented market. We believe that we are the leading supplier of fresh-cut fruit to the supermarket, convenience and club store channels in the United States. Our fresh-cut fruit products include Del Monte Gold® Extra Sweet pineapples, melons, grapes, citrus, apples, mangoes, kiwis and other fruit items. The fruit we use in our fresh-cut operations are 
 5

sourced within our integrated system of company-controlled farms and from GAP-certified (good agricultural practices) independent growers. We also offer fresh-cut vegetables for prepared salads. With our acquisition of Mann Packing in 2018, we have significantly expanded our offering in North America to include a broad variety of fresh and fresh-cut vegetable products. We purchase our vegetables for these purposes from independent growers principally in the United States and Mexico. Our purchase contracts for both fruit and vegetables are typically short-term and vary by produce item. Our fresh-cut products are sold in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, the Middle East, Japan and Korea. Worldwide, our fresh-cut product sales volume increased by 83% during the past year. Combined, Del Monte and Mann Packing are the number one brand of fresh-cut value-added fruit and vegetable products in the United States (IRI syndicated data).
Non-Tropical Fruit

Non-tropical fruit includes grapes, apples, citrus, blueberries, strawberries, pears, peaches, plums, nectarines, cherries and kiwis. Generally, non-tropical fruit grows on trees, bushes or vines that shed their leaves seasonally. Approximately 40% of our non-tropical fruit net sales are from grapes. Fresh grapes are a favorite quick, easy and healthy snack among consumers young and old. In addition to their taste, research on fresh grapes suggests that grapes may offer significant health benefits. For 2018, The Packer, an industry publication ("the Packer"), reported that fresh grapes remained a preferred fruit for snacking, with nine out of ten consumers surveyed stating that they used grapes as a snack during the past 12 months. The same publication reports that in excess of 62% of U.S. customers purchased grapes within the past 12 months. According to the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") Economic Research Service, the per capita consumption of fresh grapes in 2016 was 8.1 pounds. Fresh grapes are also processed for the production of wine, raisins, juices and canned products. The higher production cost and higher product value of fresh grapes result from more intensive production practices than are required for grapes grown for processing. While California supplies the majority of total grape volume, imports have made fresh grapes available year-round in the United States, with shipments mostly from South America.  Most U.S. production is marketed from May to October.  

We sell a variety of non-tropical fruit, including all of the types referred to above.  In 2018, non-tropical fruit sales in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and South America accounted for approximately 35%, 8%, 35%, 12% and 10%, respectively, of our total net sales of non-tropical fruit. We obtain our supply of non-tropical fruit from company-owned farms in Chile and from independent growers principally in Chile and the United States.  In Chile, we purchase non-tropical fruit from independent growers and also produce a variety of non-tropical fruit on approximately 4,900 acres of company-owned or leased land. Purchase contracts for non-tropical fruit are typically made on an annual basis.
Avocados 
Avocados are one of the fastest growing produce items in the United States. According to an industry group, the Hass Avocado Board, for the 10-year period from 2008 to 2018, avocado volume in the United States increased by 168%.  Per capita consumption of avocados in the United States also increased significantly in the last 10 years.  The Packer reported that avocados were the leading item that U.S. consumers said they were buying now that they did not buy previously, while 39% of all customers purchased avocados within the past 12 months. As a result of this higher consumer demand, our avocado sales volumes have increased significantly in the past few years. Our avocados are sourced principally from Mexico. We also obtain our supply of avocados from independent growers in the United States, Chile and Peru. In Mexico, we have our own sourcing operations, ensuring a consistent supply of high-quality avocados during the growing season. We are also constructing a new avocado sorting and packing facility in Mexico which will improve efficiencies and increase our shipping capacity. This facility is planned to commence operations in late 2019. 
Melons
Based on USDA Economic Research Service, during 2016, total per capita consumption of melons in the United States was approximately 26 pounds, of which seven pounds were cantaloupes. The Packer reported that the likelihood of a cantaloupe purchase increased according to age and 41% of customers purchased cantaloupes within the past 12 months. Melons are one of the highest volume fresh produce items, and this category includes many varieties, such as cantaloupe, honeydew, specialty melons and watermelon. During the summer and fall growing seasons in the United States, Canada and Europe, demand is met in large part by local suppliers of unbranded or regionally branded melons. By contrast, in North America and Europe, imports significantly increase, and melons generally command premium pricing from November to May. Melons are grown in temperate and tropical locations and have a relatively short growing cycle.

We sell a variety of melons including cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon and specialty melons. Cantaloupes represented approximately 73% of our melon sales volume in 2018. We are a significant producer and distributor of melons from November to May in North America by sourcing melons from our company-controlled farms and independent growers in Central America, where production generally occurs during this period.  Melons sold in North America and Europe from November to May generally 
 6

command a higher price due to fewer operators and the lack of availability of alternative fruit. Melon sales in North America accounted for 96% of our net sales of melons in 2018. Based on volume, we produced 93% of the melons we sold in 2018 on company-controlled farms and purchased the remainder from independent growers.
We are able to provide our customers in North America with a year-round supply of melons from diverse sources. For example, we supply the North America market during its summer season with melons from Arizona, California and the East Coast of the United States. In Arizona, we have our own melon growing operation on approximately 4,000 acres of leased land.

We have devoted significant research and development efforts towards maintaining our expertise in melons, especially cantaloupes. Melon crop yields are highly sensitive to weather conditions and are adversely affected by high levels of rain during the growing period. We have developed specialized melon growing technology that we believe reduce our exposure to the risk of unfavorable weather conditions and significantly increase our yields. 

Tomatoes
The United States is the second largest producer of tomatoes in the world, behind China. Mexico and Canada are also important suppliers of fresh tomatoes within North America. For 2018, the Packer reported that tomatoes dropped from the number two vegetable item to the number three spot, replaced by potatoes and onions, while 65% of shoppers still purchased tomatoes over the past 12 months. In 2017, the per capita consumption of tomatoes in the United States was in excess of 20 pounds as reported by the USDA.

We source our tomatoes for the North America market mainly from the United States, Mexico, Canada and Guatemala. In Jordan, we grow tomatoes in greenhouses for the the Middle East market. The tomato category is highly fragmented with many growers, re-packers and wholesalers in various geographic regions of the United States.  As a high volume item, tomatoes are important for our network of distribution and re-packing facilities. This product category allows us to add value through leveraging our purchase volumes to reduce costs and perform the sorting, packaging and custom labeling locally, in addition to delivering on a just-in-time basis to retail chains and foodservice customers. With our fresh-cut fruit and vegetable facilities, we add additional value by incorporating tomatoes into our consumer-packaged products. We have a greenhouse tomato operation in Guatemala where we source volume for the North America market. In 2018, we ceased our tomato growing operations in Florida and Virginia principally due to high production cost. 
Vegetables

We distribute and market a variety of vegetables including potatoes, onions, bell peppers and cucumbers. While we sell bulk product, we also use our size and distribution network to find opportunities that add value such as sorting and packaging. We source our vegetables from independent growers in North and Central America. With our recent acquisition of Mann Packing, we have significantly increased our vegetable category with various varieties of whole lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower and other vegetable offerings sourced principally from growers in California, Arizona and Mexico.
Other Fruit, Products and Services

We produce, distribute and market a variety of other fruit, including plantains and mangoes, as well as various other varieties of fruit. We source these other fruit items from company controlled farms and independent growers in Costa Rica, Colombia, Guatemala and the United States.
Included in Other Fruit, Products and Services is also our third-party ocean freight business and our third-party plastics and box manufacturing business. Our third-party ocean freight business allows us to generate incremental revenue on ships’ return voyages to our product sourcing locations and when space is available on outbound voyages to our major markets, which reduces our overall shipping costs.  Our plastics and box manufacturing business produces bins, trays, bags and boxes. The box manufacturing business is intended mainly to satisfy internal packaging requirements. In the case of the plastic manufacturing business, we principally sell these products to third parties and also use a portion for our own internal packaging requirements.  
Prepared Food

We have a royalty-free perpetual license to use the DEL MONTE® Trademark in connection with the production, manufacture, sale and distribution of prepared foods and beverages in over 100 countries throughout Western, Eastern and Central Europe, Africa, the Middle East and certain Central Asian countries.  We can also produce, market and distribute certain prepared food products in North America based on our agreement with Del Monte Pacific. In Europe, Del Monte is a premier prepared food brand with an approximate 90 year history associated with fruit-based or fruit-derived products and is the leading brand for 
 7

canned fruit and pineapple in many Western European markets. The DEL MONTE® brand has had a presence in the United Kingdom since 1926 and is perceived to be a quality brand with high consumer awareness. The DEL MONTE® brand has a reputation with both consumers and retailers for value, quality and reliability.
We produce, distribute and market prepared pineapple, peaches, fruit cocktail, pears, tomatoes, fruit juices and other fruit and vegetables. Our prepared pineapple products are sourced from our own facility in Kenya. Our deciduous prepared food products, which include peaches, fruit cocktail, pears and apricots are principally sourced from our own facility in Greece and from independent producers. Our tomato products are sourced from our own facility in Greece and from independent producers in Europe. We also distribute and market beverages, including ambient juices and juice drinks, as well as various snacks. Our prepared food products are sold primarily under the DEL MONTE® label and under the buyers’ own label for major retailers. We also produce and market industrial products that are composed of fruit that has been processed in our production facilities in the form of purees, pulps and concentrates for further processing (juice, yogurt, cake manufacture and pizza) and for sale to the foodservice industry worldwide. We expect to continue investing in new product development to increase revenue, maintain our premium price position and market leadership in our product categories.  We plan to expand our offerings in the snack category by offering multiple varieties and sizes of fruit and vegetables in plastic pots and pouches with new and improved recipes and various juices, targeting the convenience store and foodservice trade in addition to the traditional retail stores in selected European and Middle East markets. We are focused on improving the European prepared food business and on our higher growth markets in the Middle East and Africa. 
Our joint ventures with Del Monte Pacific are expected to result in expanded refrigerated offerings sold across all distribution channels, and a new food and beverage concept modeled after our already successful business in the Middle East. These joint ventures will initially focus on the U.S. market with the potential for expansion into other territories where the companies' businesses complement each other. This will also greatly increase the scale of the DEL MONTE® brand by expanding into more high-quality, healthy and convenient product options for consumers. With our recent acquisition of Mann Packing, we produce and market an array of prepared vegetable offerings under the Mann family of products such as Nourish®  Bowls and Veggie Trays with dip.
Our prepared food segment also includes our Jordanian food business. This business includes a state-of-the-art vertically integrated poultry business, including poultry farms, hatcheries, a feed mill, a slaughterhouse and a meat processing plant in Jordan. Our Jordanian poultry business is the leading provider of poultry products to retail stores and foodservice operators in that country. The meat processing operation provides meat products for the Jordanian market and to other Middle East and North African markets.
Logistics Operations
We market and distribute our products to retail stores, foodservice operators, wholesalers and distributors in over 80 countries around the world. As a result, we conduct complex logistics operations on a global basis, transporting our products from the countries in which they are grown to the many markets in which they are sold worldwide. Maintaining fresh produce at the appropriate temperature is an important factor in preventing premature ripening and optimizing product quality and freshness. Consistent with our reputation for high-quality fresh produce, we must preserve our fresh produce in a continuous temperature-controlled environment, from the harvest through its distribution.
We have an integrated logistics network, which includes land and sea transportation through a broad range of refrigerated environments in ships, port facilities, containers, trucks and warehouses. Our objective is to maximize utilization of our logistics network to lower our average per-box logistics cost, while remaining sufficiently flexible to redeploy capacity or shipments to meet fluctuations in demand in our key markets. We believe that our control of the logistics process is a competitive advantage because we are able to continuously monitor and maintain the quality of our produce and ensure timely and regular distribution to customers on a year-round basis. Because logistics costs are also our largest expense other than our cost of products, we devote substantial resources to optimizing our logistic network.
We transport our fresh produce to markets worldwide using our fleet of nine owned and seven chartered ships, comprised of four refrigerated ships and three container ships with refrigerated container capacity. We also transport our fruit to destinations around the world using third-party container lines that cover the array of destinations that we do not service directly with our own ships. We also spot charter refrigerated ships during the year based on seasonal requirements. The majority of our chartered ships are chartered for remaining terms of one to five years. We believe that our fleet of owned ships, combined with longer-term charters, is effective in reducing our ocean freight costs and mitigates our exposure to the volatility of the charter market. During 2017 and 2018, we entered into definitive agreements for the construction of six new refrigerated container ships that are scheduled to be delivered commencing in 2020. This ship building program is expected to replace our entire U. S. east coast fleet of ships. We also operate a fleet of approximately 6,000 refrigerated containers. Our logistics system is supported by various information 
 8

systems. As a vertically integrated food company, managing the entire distribution chain from the field to the customer requires the technology and infrastructure to meet our customers’ complex delivery needs. 
Sales and Marketing
The DEL MONTE® brand has been used to identify premium produce products for 125 years and is recognized by consumers worldwide for quality, freshness and reliability. We employ a variety of marketing tools, including but not limited to advertising, public relations and promotions, to reinforce our brand equity with consumers and the trade. Depending on the product and market, we also provide technical, logistical and merchandising support aimed at safeguarding the superior quality of our products to the ultimate consumer. Our sales and marketing activities are conducted by our sales force located at our sales offices worldwide and at each of our distribution centers. Our commercial efforts are supported by marketing professionals located in key markets and regional offices. A key element of our sales and marketing strategy is to use our distribution centers and fresh-cut facilities to provide value-added services to our customers.
We actively support our customers through technical training in the handling of fresh produce, category management, in-store merchandising support, joint promotional activities, market research and inventory and other logistical support. Since most of our customers carry only one branded product for each fresh produce items, our marketing and promotional efforts for fresh produce emphasize trade advertising and in-store promotions.
The level of marketing investment necessary to support the prepared food business is significantly higher than that required for the fresh produce and fresh-cut fruit and vegetable business. We utilize a variety of promotional tools to build the DEL MONTE® brand and engage consumers in key markets in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. In certain European markets, we utilize distributors to perform product distribution, sales and marketing activities for the prepared food business. Under these distribution agreements, the sales, warehousing, logistics, marketing and promotion functions are all performed by the distributor. This strategy of utilizing independent distributors enables us to reduce distribution and sales and marketing expenses. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our prepared food business by entering new markets in Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East and by continuing our offerings in the snack category, targeting the convenience store and foodservice trade in selected European and Middle East markets.
During 2018, one customer, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including its affiliates), accounted for approximately 10% of our total net sales. These sales are reported in our banana, other fresh produce and prepared food segments. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales. In 2018, the top 10 customers accounted for approximately 31% of our net sales.

Note 22, “Business Segment Data” included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contains information regarding net sales to external customers attributable to each of our reportable segments and geographic regions, gross profit by each of our reportable segments, total assets attributable to each of our geographic regions, and information concerning the dependence of our reportable segments on foreign operations, for each of the years 2018, 2017 and 2016.
North America
In 2018, 64% of our net sales were in North America. In North America, we have established a highly integrated sales and marketing network that builds on our ability to control transportation and distribution throughout our extensive logistics network. We operate a total of 30 distribution centers and fresh-cut facilities. Our distribution centers have ripening capabilities and/or other value-added services. We also operate four port facilities, which include cold storage facilities.
Our logistics network provides us with a number of sales and marketing advantages. For example, because we are able to maintain the quality of our fresh produce in a continuous temperature-controlled environment, we are under less pressure to fully sell a shipment prior to its arrival at port. We are thus better able to manage the timing of our sales to optimize our margins. Our ability to off-load shipments for cold storage and distribution throughout our network also improves ship utilization by minimizing in-port docking time. Our logistics network also allows us to manage our inventory among distribution centers to effectively respond to changes in customer demand. 
We have sales professionals in locations throughout the United States and Canada. We sell to leading grocery stores and other retail chains, wholesalers, mass merchandisers, supercenters, foodservice operators, club stores, convenience stores and distributors in North America. These large customers typically take delivery of our products at the port facilities, which we refer to as FOB delivery. We also service these customers, as well as an increasing number of smaller regional chains and independent grocers, through our distribution centers. 
 9

 Europe
 In 2018, 15% of our net sales were in Europe. We distribute our fresh produce and prepared food products throughout Europe. Our fresh produce products are distributed to leading retail chains, smaller regional customers as well as to wholesalers and distributors through direct sales and distribution centers.  In the United Kingdom, we have a sales and marketing office in Staines, England and operate a fresh-cut facility in Wisbech, England.  In Germany, we operate a distribution center in the Frankfurt area. In France, we have a distribution center with banana ripening capabilities and a fresh-cut facility in the Paris area to service our expanding customer base. In the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Poland, we have sales and marketing entities that perform direct sales of our fresh produce products. 
Our prepared food products are distributed through independent distributors throughout most of Europe. In the United Kingdom, our prepared food products are distributed using a combination of both independent distributors and our own marketing entity. In Russia, we have a sales and marketing office for our prepared food products.
Middle East and North Africa
In 2018, 10% of our net sales were in the Middle East and North Africa.  We distribute our products through independent distributors and company-operated distribution facilities. In recent years, we have increased our sales in the Middle East market through distributors and established our own direct sales initiatives. Our distribution/manufacturing center in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“UAE”) is a state-of-the-art facility with just-in-time delivery capabilities that includes banana ripening and cold storage facilities, fresh-cut fruit and vegetable operations, an ultra-fresh juice manufacturing operation and prepared food manufacturing. We distribute these products in the UAE and export them to other Middle East countries. We also operate a distribution center in Abu-Dhabi, UAE that includes banana ripening and cold storage facilities. In Saudi Arabia, through our 60%-owned joint venture, we own two distribution centers with banana ripening, cold storage facilities, fresh-cut fruit and vegetable operations, and prepared food manufacturing capabilities for juices, potatoes and sandwiches.  One of the distribution centers is located in Riyadh, the capital city of Saudi Arabia, and the other distribution center is located in Jeddah, the second largest city in the country. These strategically located distribution centers distribute our fresh produce and prepared food products to these growing markets. In the UAE and in Saudi Arabia, we also distribute our products using our own innovative retail concept through our Food and Beverage (F&B) stores. These F&B stores are small retail kiosks selling our fresh-cut produce, juice and other prepared food products and are strategically located in airports, schools, hospitals and inside hyper-markets. In Saudi Arabia and the UAE, we have a catering business targeting three main domains: academic sector, corporate offices and labor camps. We belive that this business has good growth potential and leverages our costs through further vertical integration. 

In addition, we market and distribute prepared food products in the UAE, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and various other Middle East and North African markets. In Jordan, we own a state-of-the-art vertically integrated poultry business including poultry farms, hatcheries, feed mill, slaughterhouse and a meat processing plant. We are the leading provider of poultry products to retail stores and foodservice operators in that country. In Jordan, we also own a meat processing operation that provides meat products for the local market and for export to other Middle East and North African markets. As part of our vertical integration and expansion strategy in this region, in Jordan, we developed a 10 hectares ultra-modern hydroponically grown tomato operation which provides a consistent supply of tomatoes year round. In addition, during 2018, we acquired a 70% interest in a herb farm which produces various types of herbs for export to Europe and and other Middle East markets. 
In Qatar, we have a sales and marketing office to serve the expanding brand presence in the country and recently opened a F&B store located at the Doha airport. In Turkey, our sales office located in Mersin is responsible for sourcing various types of fruit serving our units across the region in addition to selling and distributing a range of prepared food products to distributors. We also have a sales and marketing office in Kuwait to service the Kuwaiti and Iraqi markets with our fresh produce products. In Tunisia, we have an office giving us our first presence in the North Africa region, after many years of serving this area using distributors. This Tunis office has commenced with direct imports of bananas and pineapples and is expected to expand with exports of locally sourced fresh produce products to the European market. During 2018, we opened an office in Morocco in order to expand our our coverage in the North Africa Region. We plan to distribute our products locally and export fresh locally-sourced fresh produce products. We believe that the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asian countries represent an area for sales growth and development of our fresh and prepared food products. Utilizing our extensive knowledge of this region, we plan to capitalize on this opportunity with increased focus and investments in these markets.
 10

Asia

In 2018, 10% of our net sales were in Asia.  We distribute our products in Asia through direct marketing and large distributors. Our principal markets in this region are Japan, South Korea, mainland China and Hong Kong. In Japan, we distribute 100% of the products we sold in 2018 through our own direct sales and marketing organization. In Japan, we operate two fresh-cut facilities. Our products are distributed from four distribution centers located at strategic ports in Japan with cold storage and banana ripening operations.
We also engage in direct sales and marketing activities in South Korea and Hong Kong. In other Asian markets, including mainland China, we sell to local distributors. We have one distribution center and banana ripening facility in Hong Kong. In South Korea, we have three distribution centers that utilize state-of-the art ripening technology which increase our ability to offer value-added services to our customers. In South Korea, we also operate a fresh-cut fruit facility.
South America

In South America, we have direct sales and marketing activities in Chile and also utilize local distributors in this region. Our sales in these markets focus mainly on non-tropical fruit including grapes, apples, citrus, blueberries, strawberries, pears, peaches, plums, nectarines, cherries and kiwis. In Chile, we also distribute our Costa Rican grown Del Monte Gold® Extra Sweet pineapple. In Brazil, we utilize local distributors for our locally grown banana sales. 
Competition

We compete based on a variety of factors, including the appearance, taste, size, shelf life and overall quality of our fresh produce, price and distribution terms, the timeliness of our deliveries to customers and the availability of our produce items. The fresh produce business is highly competitive, and the effect of competition is intensified because our products are perishable. Competition in the sale of bananas, pineapples, melons and the other fresh fruit and vegetables that we sell comes from competing producers and distributors. Our sales are also affected by the availability of seasonal and alternative produce. While historically our main competitors have been multinational banana and pineapple producers, our significantly increased product offering in recent years has resulted in additional competition from a variety of companies. These companies include local and regional producers and distributors in each of our fresh produce and fresh-cut product categories.

The extent of competition varies by product. In the pineapple and non-tropical fruit markets, we believe that the high degree of capital investment and cultivation expertise required, as well as the longer length of the growing cycle, makes it relatively difficult to enter the market. Increased competition in the production and sale of Del Monte Gold ® Extra Sweet pineapples could adversely affect our results. We expect these competitive pressures to continue.
 In the banana market, we continue to face competition from a limited number of large multinational companies. At times, particularly when demand is greater than supply, we also face competition from a large number of relatively small banana producers. Unlike the pineapple and non-tropical fruit markets, there are few barriers to entry into the banana market. Supplies of bananas can be increased relatively quickly due to bananas having a relatively short growing cycle and the limited capital investment required for banana growing. As a result of changes in supply and demand, as well as seasonal factors, banana prices fluctuate significantly.
In the pineapple and non-tropical fruit markets, we believe that the high degree of capital investment and cultivation expertise required, as well as the longer length of the growing cycle, makes it relatively difficult to enter the market. In addition, our profitability has depended significantly on our gross profit on the sale of our Del Monte Gold ® Extra Sweet pineapples. In 2018, our overall pineapple sales volume increased by 2% mostly due to product expansion in our Costa Rica operations, and our average per unit sales prices decreased 3% primarily due to higher industry supplies. Increased competition in the production and sale of Del Monte Gold ® Extra Sweet pineapples could adversely affect our results. We expect these competitive pressures to continue in 2019. 
 In the melon market, we compete with producers and distributors of both branded and unbranded melons. From June to October, the peak North American and European melon-growing season, many growers enter the market with less expensive unbranded or regionally branded melons due to the relative ease of growing melons during this period, the short growth cycle and reduced transportation costs resulting from the proximity of the melon farms to the markets. These factors permit many smaller domestic growers to enter the market. During the offshore growing season from November to May, we compete with growers principally in Central America.  
 11

 The fresh-cut produce market is highly fragmented, and we compete with a wide variety of local and regional distributors of branded and unbranded fresh-cut produce and, in the case of certain fresh-cut vegetables, a small number of large, branded producers and distributors. However, we believe that our principal competitive challenge is to capitalize on the growing trend of retail chains and independent grocers to outsource their own on-premises fresh-cut operations. We believe that our sales strategy, which emphasizes not only our existing sources of fresh produce, but also a full range of value-added services, strict compliance with food safety standards and our national distribution capability, positions us to increase our share of this market.

The processed fruit and beverage markets are mature markets characterized by high levels of competition and consumer awareness. Consumer choices are driven by price and/or quality. Large retailers with their “buyers own label” (“BOL”) products appeal to price-conscious consumers, while brand names are the key differentiator for quality-focused consumers. In the processed food and beverage markets in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, we compete with various local producers, large retailers with their BOL products, as well as with large international branded companies. It is in the branded section that our processed foods products, specifically, canned fruit and pineapple in many European countries, hold a leading position in these markets. The mature state of the market in Western Europe, together with the strength and sophistication of the large retailers there, account in part for the increasing presence of BOL products in many food and beverage categories. In the past few years, we have faced increased competitive pressure, particularly in the U.K. market, for branded processed food and beverage products. At the same time, our marketing and distribution costs in these European markets have increased. In order to reduce our costs and increase our competitiveness in the processed food business, we use distributors in certain key European markets to perform product distribution and sales and marketing activities. Under these arrangements, the sales, warehousing, logistics, marketing and promotion functions are all performed by the distributor.  In the United Kingdom, we have also outsourced our beverage production.  This strategy takes advantage of lower cost and established marketing and distribution networks and enables us to reduce costs and increase our competitiveness in these mature markets.
Quality Assurance

To ensure the consistent high quality of our products, we have quality assurance operations placed throughout our global operations under the direction of our corporate quality assurance team. This quality assurance team maintains and enforces detailed quality specifications for all our products so that they meet or exceed our high quality standards and any applicable regulatory requirements. Our specifications require extensive sampling of our fresh produce at each stage of the production and distribution process using external appearance, internal quality, size, color, porosity, translucency, sweetness and other criteria. Only fresh produce meeting our stringent quality specifications is sold under the DEL MONTE® brand.

We are able to maintain the high quality of our products by growing a substantial portion of our own produce and working closely with our independent growers. We insist that all produce supplied by our independent growers meet the same stringent quality requirements as the produce grown on our farms. Accordingly, we monitor our independent growers to ensure that their produce will meet our agricultural and quality control standards, offer technical assistance on certain aspects of production and packing and, in some cases, manage the farms. The quality assurance process begins on the farms and continues as harvested products enter our packing facilities. Where appropriate, we cool the fresh produce at our packing facilities to maximize quality and optimize shelf life. 
As an indication of our worldwide commitment to quality, food safety, and sustainability, many of our operations are third party certified in globally recognized standards developed for the safe and sustainable production and distribution of quality foods.  These standards include the International Organization for Standardization’s ISO 22000 and the Global Food Safety (GFS) Initiative benchmarked standards of Primus GFS, Global G.A.P, and we are in compliance with all components of the FDA's Food Safety Modernization Act. All of our operations that produce or handle high risk foods (tomatoes, melons or leafy greens) apply Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points ("HACCP") principles. HACCP is a management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of biological, chemical and physical hazard from raw material production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. Our certification also include SCS Global Services’ Sustainably Grown Certified and the Sustainable Agriculture Network’s Rain Forest Alliance for sustainable agriculture and food production, and our Costa Rica Banana operation has been certified as Carbon Neutral by SCS Global Services since 2015. Taken together, these certifications reflect our commitment to quality and the strictest standards of food safety. 
 Government Regulation
 Agriculture and the sale and distribution of fresh produce are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries where the produce is grown and the countries where it is marketed. We have internal policies and procedures to comply with the most stringent regulations applicable to our products, as well as a technical staff to monitor pesticide usage and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We believe we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations.

 12

We are also subject to various government regulations in countries where we market our products. The countries in which we market a material amount of our products are the United States, Canada, the countries of the EU, Japan, China, South Korea, Jordan, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. These government regulations include:


• | sanitary regulations, particularly in the United States and the EU;


• | regulations governing pesticide use in all source countries and residue standards in all market countries, particularly in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany and Japan and South Korea;


• | ongoing Endocrine Disruptor Assessment programs in the EU and United States may potentially impact availability, use and residue tolerance of some pesticides; and


• | regulations governing traceability, packaging and labeling, particularly in the United States and the EU.


Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in an order barring the sale of part or all of a particular shipment of our products or, in an extreme case, the sale of any of our products for a specified period. In addition, we believe there has been an increasing emphasis on the part of consumers, as well as retailers, wholesalers, distributors and foodservice operators, on food safety issues, which could result in our business and operations being subject to increasingly stringent food safety regulations or guidelines.
European Union Banana Import Regulations
In December 2007, most of the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) signed a bilateral agreement with the EU that allows ACP bananas duty free access to the EU market without quantitative limitation commencing January, 1, 2008. 
In December 2009, the EU entered into an agreement with certain Latin America banana exporting countries to settle a long running dispute over banana import tariffs. This agreement was ratified in May 2010. Under this agreement, the EU will gradually reduce import tariffs on bananas from Latin America on an annual basis from the current level of €117 per ton in 2018 to €114 per ton by 2019, except for countries under Free Trade Agreements (FTA's). Countries under FTA's that signed bilateral agreements with the EU in 2012 are benefiting from accelerated but gradual reduction of import duties. The FTA's are in effect for Central American countries, Colombia, and Peru. The duty for FTA countries was €89 per ton for 2018, it will be €82 in 2019 and will be reduced to €75 per ton by January 1, 2020. Our Colombia and Central America sourced bananas benefit from this FTA agreement. 
Environmental Proceedings

The management, use and disposal of some chemicals and pesticides are inherent aspects of our production operations. These activities and other aspects of production are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, depending upon the country of operation. In addition, in some countries of operation, environmental laws can require the investigation and, if necessary, remediation of contamination related to past or current operations. We are not a party to any dispute or legal proceeding relating to environmental matters where we believe that the risk associated with the dispute or legal proceeding would be material, except as described in Item 3.  Legal Proceedings and Note 17, “Litigation” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in connection with the Kunia Well Site.
 On May 10, 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") identified a certain site at our plantation in Hawaii for potential listing on the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. See Item 3.  Legal Proceedings and Note 17, “Litigation” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
 Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, Etc.
 Our research and development programs have led to improvements in agricultural and growing practices and product packaging technology. These programs are directed mainly at reducing the cost and risk of pesticides, using natural biological agents to control pests and diseases, testing new varieties of our principal fruit varieties for improved crop yield and resistance to wind damage and improving post-harvest handling. We have also been seeking to increase the productivity of low-grade soils for improved banana growth and experimenting with various other types of fresh produce. Our research and development efforts are conducted by our staff of professionals and include studies conducted in laboratories, as well as on-site field analysis and experiments. Our research and development professionals are located at our production facilities and in the United States, and 
 13

we provide our growers with access to improved technologies and practices. We operate research and development facilities in the United States and Costa Rica where we conduct various research activities relating to the development of new fruit varieties.
 Some of the research and development projects include:


• | the development of the Del Monte Gold® Extra Sweet pineapple and other pineapple and melon varieties; and


• | improved irrigation methods and soil preparation for melon planting.


Our total corporate research and development expenses were $3.2 million for 2018, $3.3 million for 2017 and $3.3 million for 2016, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have the exclusive right to use the DEL MONTE® brand for fresh fruit, fresh vegetables and other fresh and fresh-cut produce and certain other specified products on a royalty-free basis under a worldwide, perpetual license from Del Monte Corporation, an unaffiliated company that owns the DEL MONTE® trademark. Del Monte Corporation and several other unaffiliated companies manufacture, distribute and sell under the DEL MONTE®  brand canned or processed fruit, vegetables and other produce, as well as dried fruit, snacks and other products. Our licenses allow us to use the trademark “DEL MONTE®” and the words “DEL MONTE®” in association with any design or logotype associated with the brand. The licenses also give us certain other trademarks and trademark rights, on or in connection with the production, manufacture, sale and distribution of fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, other fresh produce and certain other specified products. In addition, the licenses allow us to use certain patents and trade secrets in connection with the production, manufacture, sale and distribution of our fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, other fresh produce and certain other specified products.

We also have a royalty-free perpetual license to use the DEL MONTE® trademark in connection with the production, manufacture, sale and distribution of all food and beverage products in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East and certain Central Asian countries. We can also produce, market and distribute certain prepared food products in North America based on our recently announced agreement with Del Monte Pacific utilizing the DEL MONTE® brand.
We also sell produce under several other brands for which we have obtained registered trademarks, including UTC®, Rosy®, Fruit Express®, Just Juice®, Fruitini® and other regional brands.
In 2018, with the acquisition of Mann Packing we obtained ownership of Mann's family of brands such as Mann's®, Arcadian Harvest®, Nourish®, Broccolini®, Caulilini®, Better Burger Leaf® and RomaLeaf & Blend®. 

Seasonality

In part, as a result of seasonal sales price fluctuations, we have historically realized a greater portion of our net sales and of our gross profit during the first two calendar quarters of the year. The sales price of any fresh produce item fluctuates throughout the year due to the supply of and demand for that particular item, as well as the pricing and availability of other fresh produce items, many of which are seasonal in nature. For example, the production of bananas is continuous throughout the year and production is usually higher in the second half of the year, but the demand for bananas varies because of the availability of other fruit. As a result, demand for bananas is seasonal and generally results in higher sales prices during the first six months of the calendar year. We make most of our sales of non-tropical fruit from October to May. In the melon market, the entry of many growers selling unbranded or regionally branded melons during the peak North American and European melon growing season results in greater supply, and therefore lower selling prices, from June to October. As a result of greater demand during the fourth quarter, the prepared food business is expected to have higher net sales and gross profit during this period. 
 14

These seasonal fluctuations are illustrated in the following table, which presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for the periods indicated:
 
 | Year ended 
 | December 28, 2018 | | December 29, 2017

Employees

At year end 2018, we had approximately 40,500 employees worldwide, substantially all of whom are year-round employees. Approximately 97% of these persons are employed in production locations. We believe that our overall relationship with our employees and unions is satisfactory.
