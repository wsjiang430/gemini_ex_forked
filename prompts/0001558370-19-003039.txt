 Item 1. Our Business
 Business Description
 Precipio, Inc., and its subsidiary, (collectively, “we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company” or “Precipio”) is a cancer diagnostics company providing diagnostic products and services to the oncology market. We have built and continue to develop a platform designed to eradicate the problem of misdiagnosis by harnessing the intellect, expertise and technologies developed within academic institutions, and delivering quality diagnostic information to physicians and their patients worldwide. We operate a cancer diagnostic laboratory located in New Haven, Connecticut and have partnered with the Yale School of Medicine and other institutions to capture the expertise, experience and technologies developed within academia so that we can provide a better standard of cancer diagnostics and aim to solve the growing problem of cancer misdiagnosis. We also operate a research and development facility in Omaha, Nebraska which will focus on further development of various technologies, among them ICE-COLD-PCR, or ICP, the patented technology described further below, which was exclusively licensed to us by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc., or Dana-Farber, at Harvard University, in addition to IV-Cell, and HemeScreen, further discussed below. The research and development center focuses on the development of these technologies, which we believe will enable us to commercialize these and other technologies developed with our current and future academic partners. Our platform connects patients, physicians and diagnostic experts residing within academic institutions. Launched in 2017, the platform facilitates the following relationships:
· | Patients: patients may search for physicians in their area and consult directly with academic experts that are on the platform. Patients may also have access to new academic discoveries as they become commercially available.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Physicians: physicians can connect with academic experts to seek consultations on behalf of their patients and may provide consultations for patients in their area seeking medical expertise in that physician’s relevant specialty. Physicians will also have access to new diagnostic solutions to help improve diagnostic accuracy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Academic Experts: academic experts on the platform can make themselves available for patients or physicians seeking access to their expertise. Additionally, these experts have a platform available to commercialize their research discoveries. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We intend to continue updating our platform to allow for patient-to-patient communications and allow individuals to share stories and provide support for one another, to allow physicians to consult with their peers to discuss and share challenges and solutions, and to allow academic experts to interact with others in academia on the platform to discuss their research and cross-collaborate.
 Industry
 We believe that there is currently a significant problem with unaddressed rates of misdiagnosis across numerous disease states (particularly in cancer) due to an inefficient and commoditized industry. We believe that the diagnostic industry focuses primarily on competitive pricing and test turnaround times, at the expense of quality and accuracy. Increasingly complex disease states are met with eroding specialization rather than increased expertise. According to a study conducted by the National Coalition of Health, this results in an industry with cancer misdiagnosis rates up to 28%, which is failing to meet the needs of physicians, patients and the healthcare system as a whole. New technologies offer improved accuracy; however, many are either inaccessible or are not economically practical for clinical use. Despite much publicity of the industry transitioning from fee-per-service to value-based payments, this transition has not yet occurred in diagnostics. When a patient is misdiagnosed, physicians end up administering incorrect treatments, often creating adverse effects rather than improving outcomes. We believe that Insurance Providers, Medicare and Medicaid waste valuable dollars on the application of incorrect treatments and can incur substantial downstream costs. Most importantly however, patients pay the ultimate price of misdiagnosis with increased morbidity and mortality. According to a report by Pinnacle Health, the estimated cost of misdiagnosis within the healthcare system is $750 billion annually. We believe that the academic path of specialization produces the critical expertise necessary to correctly diagnose disease and that academic institutions have an unlocked potential to address this problem. Our solution is to create an exclusive platform that harnesses academic expertise and proprietary technologies to deliver the highest standard of diagnostic accuracy and patient care. Physicians, hospitals, payers and, most importantly, patients all benefit from more accurate diagnostics.

 Market
 As a services and technology commercialization company, we currently participate in two components within the U.S. domestic oncology diagnostics market. The first is the anatomic pathology services market, which is estimated to reach a $26.1 billion annual market by 2024 with a compound annual growth rate of 6.16%. The second component is the liquid biopsy reagents/kits market. According to the Piper Jaffray report from September 2015, the domestic oncology liquid biopsy market estimate is over $28 billion per year and includes screening, therapy selection, treatment monitoring and recurrence. The current market size for colon, lung and melanoma is 426,000 new cases per year and over 2.5 million people living with cancer, creating a potential market opportunity of $8.2 billion. We believe additional opportunities exist in clinical trials searching for low cost and high quality solutions for patient selection and treatment monitoring. Our Solution
 Our Platform
 Our platform is designed to provide physicians and their patients access to necessary academic expertise and technology in order to better provide diagnoses. To our knowledge, we are the only company focused on addressing the issue of diagnostic accuracy with an innovative, robust and scalable business model by:

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enabling cross-collaboration between physicians and academic institutions to advance research and discovery.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our exclusive agreement with the Department of Pathology at Yale University, or the Pathology Services Agreement, is part of a unique platform that, to our knowledge, is not offered by other commercial laboratories. Our customers are oncologists who biopsy their patients in order to confirm or rule out the presence of cancer. After our customers send the samples to us, we conduct all the technical tests at our New Haven facility. We then transmit the test results to the pathologists at Yale who have access to our laboratory information system from their respective offices, enabling them to review and render their diagnostic interpretation of the test results for reporting. In partnership with Yale, we have developed a proprietary algorithm that is applied to each sample submitted to us for testing, resulting in our ability to render a more precise and accurate diagnosis. The final results are prepared by Yale pathologists and integrated into the final report by us, and are then delivered electronically through our portal to the referring clinician. The patient’s insurance is billed for the services; we are paid for the technical work done at our laboratory; and Yale pathologists are paid by us for their diagnostic interpretation.
 Under the Pathology Services Agreement, the Yale Department of Pathology may not provide the hematopathology services to any other commercial entity that is our competitor. The Pathology Services Agreement allows for termination by either party (i) for uncured breach by the other party, (ii) if either party has its respective license suspended or revoked, (iii) if the insurance coverage of either party is canceled or modified, (iv) if we fail to maintain or meet the requirements of Medicare conditions of participation, or (v) if we declare bankruptcy. The Pathology Services Agreement also provides that if the performance by either party (i) jeopardizes the licensure or accreditation of Yale or any Yale physician, (ii) jeopardizes either party’s participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal, state or commercial reimbursement programs, (iii) violates any statute, ordinance or otherwise is deemed illegal, (iv) is deemed unethical by any recognized body, agency or association in the medical or laboratory fields, or (v) causes a substantial threat to Yale’s tax-exempt status, then either party may initiate negotiations to amend the Pathology Services Agreement and the Agreement will terminate if a mutually agreed amendment is not executed by the parties within 30 days.
 Our Technology 
    
1. | ICE-COLD-PCR
---+-------------

 
 
  4

 

     ICP technology was developed at Harvard and is licensed exclusively to us by Dana-Farber. ICP is a unique, proprietary, patented specimen enrichment technology that increases the sensitivity of molecular based tests from approximately 90-95% to 99.99%. Traditional molecular testing is done on tumor biopsies. These tests are typically conducted at disease onset, when the patient undergoes a biopsy. In the typical course of treatment, a patient is rarely re-biopsied, and therefore, genetic information is based solely on the initial biopsy. Tumors are known to shed cells into the patient’s bloodstream where they circulate alongside normal cells; however, existing testing methodologies are not sufficiently sensitive to differentiate between tumor and normal cells. The increased sensitivity provided by ICP allows for testing of genetic mutations that occur within tumors to be conducted on peripheral blood samples, termed liquid biopsies. This technical capability enables physicians to test for genetic mutations through a simple blood test rather than an invasive biopsy extracted from the actual tumor. The results of such tests can be used for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic decisions. The technology is encapsulated within a chemical (reagent) used during the specimen preparation process, which enriches (amplifies) the tumor DNA detected within the blood sample while suppressing the normal DNA. In addition to offering this technology as a clinical service, we are developing panels that will be sold as reagent kits to other laboratories to enable this testing in their facilities, thereby improving their test sensitivity and more accurate diagnoses via liquid biopsies. The business model of selling reagents to other laboratories expands the reach and impact of our technology while eliminating the reimbursement risks from running the tests in-house.
     Gene sequencing is performed on tissue biopsies taken surgically from the tumor site in order to identify potential therapies that will be more effective in treating the patient. There are several limitations to this process. First, surgical procedures have several limitations, including:

· | Cost: surgical procedures are usually performed in a costly hospital environment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Surgical access: various tumor sites are not always accessible (e.g. brain tumors), in which cases no biopsy is available for diagnosis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Risk: patient health may not permit undergoing an invasive surgery; therefore, a biopsy cannot be obtained at all.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Time: the process of scheduling and coordinating a surgical procedure often takes time, delaying the start of patient treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Second, there are several tumor-related limitations that provide a challenge to obtaining such genetic information from a tumor:

· | Tumors are heterogeneous by nature: a tissue sample from one area of the tumor may not properly represent the tumor’s entire genetic composition; thus, the diagnostic results from a tumor may be incomplete and non-representative.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Metastases: in order to accurately test a patient with metastatic disease, ideally an individual biopsy sample should be taken from each site (if those sites are even known). These biopsies are very difficult to obtain; therefore, physicians often rely on biopsies taken only from the primary tumor site.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We license the ICP technology from Dana-Farber through a license agreement referred to herein as the License Agreement. The License Agreement grants us an exclusive license to the ICP technology, subject to a non-exclusive license granted to the U.S. government, in the areas of mutation detection using Sanger (di-deoxy) sequencing and mitochondrial DNA analysis for all research, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic uses in humans, animals, viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants or fossilized material. The License Agreement also grants us a non-exclusive license in the areas of mutation detection using DHPLC, surveyor-endonuclease-based mutation detection and second generation sequencing techniques. We paid Dana-Farber an initial license fee and are required to make milestone payments with respect to the first five licensed products or services we develop using the licensed technology, as well as royalties ranging from high single to low double digits on net sales of licensed products and services for sales made by us and sales made to any distributors. The License Agreement remains in effect until we cease to sell licensed products or services under said agreement. Dana-Farber has the right to immediately terminate the License Agreement if (i) we cease to carry on our business with respect to licensed products and services, (ii) we fail to make any payments under the License Agreement (subject to a cure period), (iii) we fail to comply with due diligence obligations under the License Agreement (subject to a cure period), (iv) we default in our obligations to procure and maintain insurance as required by the License Agreement, (v) any of our officers is convicted of a felony relating to the manufacture, use, sale or importation of licensed products under the License Agreement, (vi) we materially breach any provision of the License Agreement (subject to a cure period), or (vii) we or

Dana-Farber become insolvent. We may terminate the License Agreement for convenience upon 180 days’ prior written notice.
    
2. | IV-Cell
---+--------

      The diagnostic process of hematopoietic diseases involves conducting cell-culture tests by the cytogenetic laboratory to imitate in-vivo conditions. The four groups of cell lineages cultured are:

· | Myeloid cells – indicating myeloid neoplasms (MDS, AML, CML)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | B-cells – indicating B-cell neoplasms (B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | T-cells – indicating T-cell neoplasms (T-cell lymphoma)
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | Plasma cells – indicating plasma cell neoplasms (multiple myeloma)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

      The cytogeneticist must decide up front which cell lineage to select to be cultured. In most cases, due to specimen limitation, low cellularity, or cell viability, the cytogeneticist can select only one of the above cell lines to culture. Often, the initial clinical suspicion is not in line with the final diagnosis determined by the pathologist based on the rest of the work up. Our internal data has shown that this occurs in approximately 50% of bone marrow biopsies. If the wrong cell lineage is selected, the diagnosis may be compromised (or return a false negative diagnosis) because the lab will be culturing and investigating the wrong cells (essentially “going down the wrong path”).
     We have developed IV-Cell, a proprietary culture media that addresses the problem of selective culturing – by creating a universal media that enables simultaneous culturing of all 4 hematopoietic cell lineages. This ensures that no cell lineage is missed in the diagnostic process, and the technician is able to select any of the 4 lineages during the culturing process.
     IV-Cell was validated in our laboratory in parallel with existing reagents available on the market and has successfully demonstrated superior results. Subsequently, IV-Cell has been used at our laboratory for the past 12 months on >500 clinical specimens, producing superior diagnostic results. IV-Cell also produces chromosomes with an average band resolution of 500, approximately 25% higher than achieved with standard culture media.
     We intend to commercialize this technology by providing major laboratories with access to the media. This can be achieved via a direct supply contract, whereby we will contract with a manufacturer (under license) to produce the media, and supply it to laboratories. 
     3. HemeScreen
     Each year, an estimated 140,000 patients are diagnosed with diseases in the MPN or MDS blood cancer categories. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (the “NCCN”) guidelines require that these patients be tested for genetic mutations in four key genes:

· | JAK2 (V617F)
--+-------------


· | JAK2 (exon 12)
--+---------------


· | CALR
--+-----


· | MPL
--+----

      The clinical significance of these mutations is substantial to patient treatment. A positive result in either of the JAK2 mutations indicates the patient may be eligible for a targeted therapy. A positive result in the CALR or MPL gene indicates a good prognosis, meaning the disease is less aggressive, and the physician may therefore choose to treat the patient in a less aggressive manner. The results of these genetic tests are critical to determining a treatment plan, and therefore both the importance, and the speed of which the results are delivered, may significantly impact patient care. 
     At the current reimbursement levels (approximately $600 for full panel at Medicare rates) and given the costs to run the tests, laboratories running the test in house must either batch samples to gain efficiency, or send the test out to another reference laboratory. Most hospital laboratories don’t have the volume and patient frequency to economically 

 
  6

 
justify running the test, and therefore send the test out. This has created an industry average turnaround time for results of between 2-4 weeks (depending on the lab providing the test).
     Precipio has developed and patented a proprietary screening panel for all 4 genes in one rapid scanning panel. The test screens for the presence of these mutations in a very economic manner. Due to the improved economics, laboratories can reduce the batch requirements for the test while still enjoying a positive economic model and reducing the turnaround time for results, providing improved clinical service to physicians.
     Precipio offers two HemeScreen commercial options:
 1. Reference the send-out to Precipio. We offer an average of a 2-day TAT for the test, markedly better than the industry average of approximately 2 weeks.
 2. Precipio to provide the reagents on an RUO (Research Use Only) basis), and a laboratory can set up the test In-house test as an LDT (Laboratory Developed Test).
     At an average reimbursement rate of approximately $600 per test, the US Market Revenue Potential is approximately $84 million per year, in addition to international demand.
 Our Products & Services
 Our initial product offering consists of clinical diagnostic services harnessing the expertise of pathologists from premier academic institutions and the commercialization and application of our various technologies. Our clinical diagnostic services focus on the diagnosis of different hematopoietic or blood-related cancers and the delivery of an accurate diagnosis to oncologists, with demonstrated superior results through the harnessing of subspecialized academic pathologists. We intend to enter into additional partnerships with premiere academic institutions during 2019 that will further broaden and strengthen our academic expert network. Our cutting-edge liquid biopsy technology, ICP, enables detection of abnormalities in blood samples down to as low as .01%. Our proprietary cytogenetics media IV-Cell enables laboratories to arrive at more accurate results while reducing inventory and other operating costs. Our proprietary HemeScreen panel enables hospitals and laboratories to run an important genetic mutation test at a lower cost, resulting in faster results delivered to physicians and their patients. Our customers are oncologists, hospitals, reference laboratories, and pharma and biotech companies. These technologies enable our customers to achieve more accurate results for their patients, with improved economics as well as clinical outcomes. 
     We built and obtained CLIA certification to operate our New Haven laboratory. The laboratory is approximately 3,000 square feet and has several sub-departments such as flow cytometry, immuno-histochemistry, cytogenetics, and molecular testing. The laboratory is currently operated by five lab technicians and is supervised by a laboratory manager and a medical director. Our laboratory is inspected every two years by a Connecticut state-appointed inspector, and once approved, we are issued a CLIA-certificate. Furthermore, the laboratory supervisor and medical director must conduct a self-inspection every two years (rotating with the state inspection) and must submit those results to the state department of health. 
     Our Strategy
 Our objective is to eradicate the problem of misdiagnosis by harnessing the intellect, expertise and technology developed within academic institutions and to deliver quality diagnostic information to physicians and their patients worldwide. To achieve this objective, our strategy is to focus our efforts on the following areas:
· | Clinical pathology services – we intend to continue building our platform by increasing the number of academic experts available on our platform and partnering with other academic institutions, allowing us to expand our portfolio of services to cover additional types of cancer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ice-Cold PCR – we believe we can commercialize and develop new applications for our ICP technology, including:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  7

 

 oDeveloping specific application panels for patient monitoring for treatment resistance and disease recurrence;
 oBuilding focused diagnostic and screening panels for initial disease identification;
 oLeveraging our platform customers to generate demand for repeat, localized, in-house liquid biopsy testing; and
 oApplying ICP technology to other markets, such as pre-natal and companion diagnostics.

· | New product pipeline through outsourced research and development – we plan on utilizing our partnerships with academic institutions to gain access to newly-developed technologies. We also believe there is an opportunity to partner with biotechnology companies to introduce their products into the U.S. market through our platform.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Academic partnerships – we intend to leverage the intellectual expertise and technologies developed within academic institutions. We believe we have validated this model through our partnership with the Yale School of Medicine and are currently in the process of adding new academic partners.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Competition
 Our principal competition in clinical pathology services comes largely from two groups. The first group consists of companies that specialize in oncology and offer directly competing services to our diagnostic services. These companies provide a high level of service focused on oncology and offer their services to oncologists and pathology departments within hospitals. Competitors in this group include Genoptix, GenPath Diagnostics and Miraca Life Sciences. The second group consists of large commercial companies that offer a wide variety of laboratory tests ranging from simple chemistry tests to complex genetic testing. Competitors in this group include LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics. We believe that companies in this industry primarily compete on price and rapid delivery of results. We have chosen to focus on the increased quality and accuracy of the results we provide. Within the liquid biopsy market, our competitors include Guardant Health and Trovagene, Inc. Competitive Advantage
 We capitalize on the intellectual expertise and technologies developed by experts within academic institutions. While several industry papers report a case misdiagnosis rate as high as 28%, we believe that leveraging academic expertise can significantly reduce this rate. In an initial data set of over 100 clinical cases received and processed by us and with a diagnosis rendered by academic pathologists, we believe less than 1% have resulted in misdiagnosis. The diagnostic report provided by us was then requested by a patient or the patient’s physician for a second opinion to be conducted by another laboratory. In these instances, less than 1% were in disagreement with our report’s original diagnosis. Though less than 5% of all cancer patients are treated in academic centers that benefit from this specialized expertise, the majority of patients are diagnosed by commercial reference laboratories. These commercial laboratories and diagnostic companies have broad access to and serve over 95% of all cancer patients; however, their lack of specialized expertise results in significantly higher misdiagnosis rates. Academic institutions also invest heavily in the development of new technologies, most of which is used internally and does not benefit outside or commercial lab patients. Our platform provides all patients with access to these innovative technologies developed by us and in collaboration with other academic institutions we engage with. Government Regulation
 The healthcare industry is subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental entities at the federal, state and local level. Laws and regulations in the healthcare industry are extremely complex and, in many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation. Our business is impacted not only by those laws and regulations that are directly applicable to us but also by certain laws and regulations that are applicable to our payors, vendors and referral sources. While our management believes we are in compliance with all of the existing laws and regulations applicable to us, such laws and regulations are subject to rapid change and often are uncertain in their application and enforcement. Further, to the extent we engage in new business initiatives, we must continue to evaluate whether new laws and regulations are applicable to us. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to scrutiny 

 
  8

 
or challenge under one or more of these laws or that any enforcement actions would not be successful. Any such challenge, whether or not successful, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and consolidated financial statements.
     Our current active laboratory certifications can be found on http://www.precipiodx.com/accreditations.html. The laboratory operations are governed by Standard Operating Procedure manuals, or SOPs, which detail each aspect of the laboratory environment including the work flow, quality control, maintenance, and safety. These SOPs are reviewed and approved annually and signed off by the laboratory manager and medical director.
     Among the various federal and state laws and regulations that may govern or impact our current and planned operations are the following:
 Reimbursement
     As blood-related cancers are more likely to be developed later in life, the largest insurance provider is Medicare, which constitutes approximately 50% of our patients’ cases. Non-Medicare patients are typically insured by private insurance companies who provide patient coverage and pay for patients’ health-related costs. These private insurance companies will often adjust their rates according to the insurance rates annually published by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. We, and other providers, typically bill according to the codes relevant to the tests we conduct. Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement
 Many of the services that we provide are reimbursed by Medicare and state Medicaid programs and are therefore subject to extensive government regulation.
     Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance coverage for qualified persons age 65 or older, some disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease and persons with Lou Gehrig’s disease. Medicaid programs are jointly funded by the federal and state governments and are administered by states under approved plans.
     Medicaid provides medical benefits to eligible people with limited income and resources and people with disabilities, among others. Although the federal government establishes general guidelines for the Medicaid program, each state sets its own guidelines regarding eligibility and covered services. Some individuals, known as “dual eligibles”, may be eligible for benefits under both Medicare and a state Medicaid program. Reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs is contingent on the satisfaction of numerous rules and regulations, including those requiring certification and/or licensure. Congress often enacts legislation that affects the reimbursement rates under government healthcare programs.
     Approximately 54% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was derived directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs. Also, we indirectly provide services to beneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored healthcare programs through managed care entities. Should there be material changes to federal or state reimbursement methodologies, regulations or policies, our direct reimbursements from government-sponsored healthcare programs, as well as service fees that relate indirectly to such reimbursements, could be adversely affected.
 Healthcare Reform
 In recent years, federal and state governments have considered and enacted policy changes designed to reform the healthcare industry. The most prominent of these healthcare reform efforts, the Affordable Care Act, has resulted in sweeping changes to the U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care. As currently structured, the Affordable Care Act increases the number of persons covered under government programs and private insurance; furnishes economic incentives for measurable improvements in health care quality outcomes; promotes a more integrated health care delivery system and the creation of new health care delivery.

 We believe we are in compliance with current environmental protection requirements that apply to us or our business. Costs attributable to environmental compliance are not currently material. Intellectual Property 
     We license the ICP technology from Dana-Farber through the License Agreement. The License Agreement grants us an exclusive license to the ICP technology, subject to a non-exclusive license granted to the U.S. government, in the areas of mutation detection using Sanger (di-deoxy) sequencing and mitochondrial DNA analysis for all research, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic uses in humans, animals, viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants or fossilized material. Merger Transaction and Corporate History
 On June 29, 2017, Precipio (then known as “Transgenomic, Inc.”, or “Transgenomic”), completed a reverse merger or, the Merger, with Precipio Diagnostics, LLC, a privately held Delaware limited liability company or, Precipio Diagnostics, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 12, 2016, as amended on 

 
  10

 
February 2, 2017 and June 29, 2017, by and among Transgenomic, Precipio Diagnostics and New Haven Labs Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transgenomic. Pursuant to the merger agreement, New Haven Labs Inc. merged with and into Precipio Diagnostics, with Precipio Diagnostics surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the combined company (See Note 3 - Reverse Merger within the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in the Annual report on Form 10-K). In connection with the Merger, we changed our name from Transgenomic, Inc. to Precipio, Inc., relisted our common stock under Precipio, Inc. on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and effected a 1‑for‑30 reverse stock split of our common stock. Upon the consummation of the Merger, the historical financial statements of Precipio Diagnostics become the Company’s historical financial statements. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Precipio Diagnostics are included in the comparative prior periods. As a result of the Merger, historical preferred stock, common stock, restricted units, warrants and additional paid-in capital, including share and per share amounts, have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the equity structure of the combined company, including the effect of the Merger exchange ratio. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding unit of Precipio Diagnostics was exchanged for 10.2502 pre-reverse stock split shares of Company Common Stock.
 Precipio was incorporated in Delaware on March 6, 1997. Our principal office is located at 4 Science Park, New Haven, Connecticut 06511. Precipio Diagnostics was incorporated in Delaware in November 2011.
