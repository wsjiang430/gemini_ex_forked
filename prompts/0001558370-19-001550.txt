 Item 1.Business
 As used herein, “CPI,” “we,” “our” and similar terms refer to CPI Card Group Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
 Overview
 We are a leading provider of comprehensive Financial Payment Card solutions in the United States. We define “Financial Payment Cards” as credit, debit and Prepaid Debit Cards issued on the networks of the “Payment Card Brands” (Visa, Mastercard ®, American Express and Discover) and Interac (in Canada). We define “Prepaid Debit Cards” as debit cards issued on the networks of the Payment Card Brands, but not linked to a traditional bank account. We have established a leading position in the Financial Payment Card market through more than 20 years of experience. Our customers include leading national and regional banks, independent community banks, credit unions, managers of prepaid debit programs, “Group Service Providers” (organizations that assist small card issuers, such as credit unions, with managing their credit and debit card programs, including managing the Financial Payment Card issuance process, core banking operations and other financial services) and card processors. We serve a diverse set of over 2,000 direct customers and several thousand indirect customers, including some of the largest issuers of debit and credit cards in the United States and Canada, and the largest U.S. Prepaid Debit Card program managers, as well as thousands of independent community banks, credit unions, Group Service Providers and card processors.
 We serve our customers through a network of production and card services facilities, including high-security facilities in the United States which are certified by one or more of the Payment Card Brands and, where required by our customers, certified to be in compliance with the standards of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (the “PCI Security Standards Council”). This leading network of high-security production facilities allows us to serve the needs of our diverse customer base.
 Driven by a combination of our strong relationships, quality, technology, and innovation, we believe we have strong positions in the following markets:

· | the U.S. prepaid debit market, serving several of the top U.S. Prepaid Debit Card program managers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the U.S. small to mid-sized issuer market, which includes independent community banks and credit unions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the U.S. large issuer market, serving some of the largest U.S. debit and credit card issuers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  On August 3, 2018, we completed the sale of the U.K. Limited segment. The historical financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the U.K. segment have been restated for all periods to conform with discontinued operations presentation. Unless otherwise indicated, financial information within this document relates to continuing operations.
 Our business consists of the following reportable segments: U.S. Debit and Credit, which primarily produces Financial Payment Cards and provides integrated card services to card-issuing banks in the United States, and U.S. Prepaid Debit, which primarily provides integrated card services to Prepaid Debit Card program managers in the United States.  Business not considered part of these segments are considered “Other” and include our operations in Canada and corporate expenses. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Canadian subsidiary to Allcard Limited, a provider of card solutions to the gift and loyalty sectors. The sale agreement did not include customers for which we only manufacture and personalize Financial Payment Cards.  The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019.  The agreement to sell our Canadian subsidiary does not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation. The Financial Payment Card business customers of our Canada operations will either migrate to our

operations in the U.S. or migrate to other service providers before the transaction closes. The divestiture allows us to further optimize our footprint and is consistent with our previously announced plan to better position ourselves to serve customers by focusing on our core businesses.  
 During February 2018, we made the decision to consolidate our three personalization operations in the United States into two facilities to better enable us to optimize operations and achieve market-leading quality and service with a market-competitive business model.  This consolidation was completed in 2018.
 For information regarding our net sales by geographic location and additional details regarding our segments, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16 "Segment Reporting," and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
 Our Competitive Strengths

· | Strong Market Position with Long-Term Customer Relationships. We are focused on becoming the partner of choice for our customers by providing market-leading quality products and customer service with a market-competitive business model. We have long-standing trust-based relationships with customers, many of whom we have served for decades. Our customer relationships, particularly with those who utilize our card services and instant issuance systems and services, may involve process and technology integration. As a result, our customers are selective about working with partners they can trust to deliver the highest quality products and customer service. We strive to put our customers at the center of everything we do, and to provide responsive and high quality customer care. We also maintain important relationships with the Payment Card Brands to ensure our facilities and processes meet their standards. We believe we have established a leading market position in the U.S. prepaid debit market, built on high quality services and reliable delivery to our customers. Our installed base of instant issuance systems at bank and credit union branches across the United States may include customer integration, and our Card@Once ® instant issuance system utilizes our secure technology to instantly personalize cards. Certain customers have integrated our proprietary software into their systems to improve the quality of the overall process and to offer card design and customization to their cardholders.

· | Comprehensive End-to-End Card Solutions. The foundation of our leading market position with our small to mid-sized issuer customers is our comprehensive end-to-end Financial Payment Card solutions. Our solutions provide a full suite of products and card services required to produce, personalize and fulfill Financial Payment Cards, while maintaining the security requirements of the Payment Card Brands. We are integral to many of our customers’ card programs, pairing card production with an end-to-end offering of card data personalization and card services that are integrated within our customers’ operations. We provide card data personalization services for financial institutions and managers of Prepaid Debit Card programs that require technology integration, such as secure data links to transfer highly sensitive cardholder information. We believe that our comprehensive solution allows our customers to choose a single trusted partner to address their card program needs in a cost-effective manner instead of managing multiple suppliers across a complex value chain.

· | Certified Network of High-Security Facilities. Our high-security facilities are each certified by one or more of the Payment Card Brands and Interac (in Canada), forming a leading network of certified production facilities in the United States. The Payment Card Brand certifications allow us to produce cards bearing these brands and provide relevant card services for our issuer customers. Additionally, many of our facilities are certified to be in compliance with the standards of the PCI Security Standards Council. These certification processes are long, complex and costly, and our facilities must comply with strict standards of security in order to obtain and retain these designations, which are regularly verified by both the Payment Card Brands and our customers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Financial Payment Card Capabilities, Industry Experience, and Proprietary and Patented Solutions. Over the course of our long operating history, we have developed technological, engineering and operational expertise that we believe has made us a leader in our industry. Europay, Mastercard and Visa (“EMV”) is a global, technical standard, maintained by EMVCo for smart payment cards, and for payment terminals and automated teller machines that accept them. EMV® cards are smart cards (also called chip cards) which 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

store data on integrated circuits rather than magnetic stripes, although EMV cards may have magnetic stripes. We also produce dual-interface EMV cards that have both contact and contactless functionality. We continuously work to enhance our offerings and to create and deliver next generation products and solutions that meet the demands of the marketplace and our customers. We have invested in CPI Metals TM, a premium product capability, in response to the market. We believe that our technological and operational capabilities, combined with our specific focus on the Financial Payment Card market, gives us a competitive advantage. We have developed and acquired intellectual property over our operating history and hold 25 U.S. patents, including five patents related to our CPI Metals TM card solution, 18 foreign patents, as well as 21 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications.

· | Experienced Management Team. We have built an experienced management team, and strengthened the team with additions of certain key executives during 2018. The leadership team has energized the organization to focus on customers, accountability, and delivering results.

  Our Strategy 
 We are a payment technology company that provides end-to-end debit, credit and prepaid payment solutions delivered physically, digitally and on-demand. Our goal is to be our customers’ partner of choice by providing market-leading quality products and customer service with a market-competitive business model. We believe we are well-positioned for success given our diversified business model, history of innovation and ability to evolve with the needs and expectations of our customers. By helping our customers elevate the customer experience, we foster compelling connections between people and technology through traditional and next generation solutions that build brands and enhance people’s everyday lives.  A Customer-Centric Culture
 We aim to inspire and satisfy our customers by redefining experiences that may have traditionally seemed rigid and complex, and offering market-leading quality and service. Based on our core values of customer first, accountability, teamwork, excellence, integrity and results, our strong team of dedicated, passionate employees has helped build CPI into a leading provider of high quality products with a laser-focus on service. With our full and expanding suite of catalytic and competitively differentiated products and services, we offer our customers choice, convenience and control by providing flexibility in timing, design, product options, and overall utility. Innovation and Growth
 We strategically invest in innovation and quality to create a strong foundation for growth.  We continuously work to enhance our offerings and to create and deliver next generation products and solutions that meet the demands of the marketplace and exceed customers’ expectations. Our Products and Services
 EMV® Financial Payment Cards (Contact, Contactless, and Dual-Interface)
 We produce both plastic and metal contact EMV cards, which feature an integrated circuit that interfaces with an EMV payment terminal over a contact plate on the surface of the card when inserted into an EMV-enabled payment terminal. We also produce contactless EMV cards, and dual-interface EMV cards, which feature an RFID antenna that utilizes near field communications (“NFC”) technology to allow transactions to process on a contactless basis when the card is brought within the requisite proximity to an NFC-enabled payment terminal.  The dual-interface EMV cards additionally include the contact EMV technology.  Non-EMV Financial Payment Cards and Retail Gift Cards
 We produce non-EMV cards that utilize magnetic stripes, contactless cards which utilize NFC technology, and cards that include both magnetic stripes and NFC technology. In addition, we produce non-EMV cards that are issued on the networks of the Payment Card Brands, as well as retail gift cards (which are not issued on the network of the Payment Card Brands).

 Card Data Personalization and Fulfillment
 We provide data preparation and card data personalization solutions for debit, credit and Prepaid Debit Cards in contact EMV, dual-interface EMV, and non-EMV card formats. Our personalization services are technology-driven and provide a wide range of card customization options, using advanced processes to personalize (encode, program and emboss with data such as cardholder name and account number) and fulfill cards to individual cardholders. Our services provide customers with visibility to manage card stock inventory and fulfillment materials.  In addition, we provide EMV data script development services for our customers and in certain cases generate PIN numbers and mailers on their behalf. We offer patented card design software, known as MYCA™, which provides our customers and their cardholders the ability to design cards on the internet and customize cards with individualized digital images. We also provide consultation and card design services to further assist customers in card customization. Tamper-Evident Security Packaging Solutions
 We offer specialized and innovative tamper-evident security packaging products and services to customers with a Prepaid Debit Card offering that reduce fraud for Prepaid Debit Cards sold through the retail channel. In certain cases, we also manage the fulfillment of fully-completed Prepaid Debit Card packages to retail locations on behalf of our customers utilizing this solution. Instant Card Issuance Systems and Services
 We offer Card@Once ®, our proprietary and patented instant card issuance system and services, which provides our card issuing bank customers the ability to issue a completely personalized permanent debit or credit card within the bank branch to individual cardholders upon demand. Our instant issuance system is enabled by cloud-based software that securely transfers data from our servers to the card branch to encode a magnetic stripe, an EMV card, or a dual-interface EMV card, and personalizes the card on a desktop output terminal in a process which is certified by Mastercard ® and Visa. Our instant issuance system generates both system sales and recurring revenue from software as a service, card personalization and sales of cards and consumables. 
 CPI On-Demand TM Solutions
 Through our CPI On-Demand services, we are able to produce images, personalized payment cards and related collateral on a one-by-one, on demand basis for our customers, enabling individualized offerings and reducing waste and inventory.  Our service offering includes online ordering of a customized payment card through a program manager, with direct fulfillment to a consumer.  While not significant to our 2018 financial results, we believe the CPI On-Demand solution will further differentiate us with our financial institution customers, and we believe it will enable us to further penetrate new, business-to-business and business-to-consumer verticals such as healthcare, transit, payroll, corporate incentives, benefits and insurance.  
 Digital Services
 While not currently significant to our financial results, we are focusing on enabling digital services and payments, including self-service card customization, on demand fulfillment, order lifecycle management, customer inventory management, EMV® key management, and other innovative solutions, such as digitizing and securely delivering payment credentials as a virtual payment method. Suppliers
 One of the most important components of our products is the EMV microchip. While we have developed constructive relationships with our suppliers and, in general, receive a high level of cooperation and support from them, the objective of our procurement strategy is not to depend on any single supplier. We obtain our components from multiple suppliers located in South Korea, France, Germany, and Singapore, primarily on a purchase order basis. Our main suppliers of EMV microchips are four leading international manufacturers. Approximately 88% of our purchased EMV microchips for the year ended December 31, 2018 came from these four main suppliers. The other key components for our products are substrates (such as PVC), antennas and inlays which we also source from multiple suppliers. We continuously monitor supply chain risks and evaluate alternative suppliers based on numerous attributes including quality, performance, service, scalability, features, innovation and price.

 Customers
 In the United States, we categorize our customers as follows: large issuers, small to mid-sized issuers, prepaid debit issuers, program managers, Group Service Providers, and card processors. Our diverse customer base includes some of the largest issuers of credit and debit cards in the United States and the largest U.S. Prepaid Debit Card program managers. Our top customer represented approximately 19% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our top five customers represented approximately 39% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, and we have been serving these customers for an average of greater than 10 years.
 We generally enter into master purchase or service agreements that govern the general terms and conditions of our commercial relationships. We then enter into a purchase order or other short-term arrangements that define the quantities of products to be delivered or services rendered, and other terms specific to the order as appropriate. Usually, our contractual arrangements include neither exclusivity clauses nor commitments from our customers to order any given quantities of products on a medium or long-term basis.
 Production and Services
 Our production and services strategy has several key facets. We have a large network of integrated high-security facilities that we leverage to balance customer orders, expand the array of products and services available to our customers, provide consistent supply and execute short lead times. Our facilities and operating processes are designed to provide a differentiated level of service to each of our key customer sets. For example, we have the processes and capabilities to:
· | execute high-volume production runs that allow us to meet the competitive price points of large orders;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | execute lower-volume, highly customized runs that allow us to meet the high-service and quick-turn needs of smaller orders, as well as on-demand solutions; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | meet the specific needs of our Prepaid Debit Card customers, as an industry leader in tamper-evident secure card packaging, and through our expertise and capabilities specifically designed for this retail prepaid market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As of December 31, 2018, we operate approximately 446,000 square feet of facilities in the United States and Canada where we focus on Financial Payment Card production and personalization services. See Part I, Item 2, “Properties” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the operations of each facility.
 We rely on secure ground and secure air freight to deliver finished products to our banking customers. Due to the high-security nature of the Financial Payment Card products we provide to our banking customers, certain products must be shipped to these customers via a secure method, such as armored vehicle. With respect to customers for whom we fulfill individual and personalized debit and credit cards, we utilize the U.S. and Canadian postal services to deliver these cards directly to individual cardholders. For other customers, we predominately deliver our products via regular ground and air freight.
 Sales and Marketing
 We market ourselves as a leader and trusted partner in payments, seeking to meet or exceed the needs of our customers through high quality and meaningful, innovative products at competitive prices. We work to strategize and collaborate with our customers to bring them valuable and innovative solutions. We have approximately 30 sales representatives that give us a wide geographic reach across the United States and Canada. Our sales representatives offer a complete end-to-end solution that incorporates the full spectrum of our products and services from concept to delivery. Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on strengthening our relationships with existing customers through a consultative approach that includes cross-selling expanded services. We leverage the strength of our full-service offerings to attract new customers. Our marketing efforts focus on the needs of our specific types of customers. By tailoring our marketing strategy to different customer segments, we are able to provide relevant targeted solutions to meet their individual needs. We utilize an array of different marketing communications and thought leadership across various industry publications, editorial white papers, case studies, conferences and trade shows, print and digital advertisements, educational webinars, podcasts, and blogs to introduce our existing customers and new customers to 

 
  7

 
innovations in the payments market. Through these efforts, we drive customer retention and satisfaction, and have been able to attract new customers.
 Competition
 The market for products and services in the payment card industry is highly competitive. Some of our competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do, and therefore have substantial flexibility in competing with us, including through the use of integrated product offerings and competitive pricing. Competitive factors for our business include product quality, security, service reliability, product line comprehensiveness and integration, timely introduction of new products and features, and price.
 Our products and services compete with other card manufacturers and card solutions providers. We believe we are in competition with IDEMIA (formerly known as Oberthur Technologies S.A.), Giesecke & Devrient GmbH,  Valid S.A., Gemalto NV, CompoSecure L.L.C., Multi Packaging Solutions, Inc., and Arroweye. Certain existing and potential customers also have the ability to personalize Financial Payment Cards in-house. In addition, we compete with customers that offer transaction processing products and services to financial institutions. 
 Intellectual Property
 We own and control various intellectual property rights, such as patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, service marks, tradenames, copyrights and applications. We have been party to certain patent cross-license arrangements with industry participants and may, from time to time, enter into similar commercial agreements should we consider it necessary or beneficial for our business.
 We rely on a combination of statutory (copyright, trademark and trade secret) and contractual safeguards for intellectual property protection throughout the world. As of December 31, 2018, we had 35 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and applications, 25 existing U.S. patents, 18 foreign patents, as well as 21 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. Our patents have an average remaining maturity of 12 years, and our trademarks will be due for renewal for additional ten or fifteen-year periods on an ongoing basis.
 Environmental Protection
 Our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental protection regulations, including those governing the emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations.  Regulation
 Privacy and Data Security
 In the course of our business, we receive personally identifiable information of cardholders from our customers, either from a financial institution or through a card processor on behalf of a financial institution. Such information includes names, email and physical addresses, card account numbers and expiration dates. As a service provider to financial institutions in the United States, we are subject to certain Federal Trade Commission requirements, the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLBA”) and its implementing regulations and, as applicable, with various other federal and state privacy statutes and regulations, and the PCI Security Standards Council’s Data Security Standards, each of which is subject to change at any time. Outside of the United States, we are subject to privacy laws and regulations of numerous countries and jurisdictions. The interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws are often uncertain and in a state of flux. 
 In order to comply with our obligations under applicable privacy laws and regulations and our contractual agreements with our customers, we are required to implement adequate policies and safeguards to protect the privacy of personally identifiable information we receive. As part of their compliance with these requirements, each of our U.S. customers is expected to have a program in place for protecting personally identifiable information and responding to unauthorized access to, or use of, personally identifiable information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to consumers, as required by law. A majority of U.S. states have enacted security breach legislation, 

 
  8

 
requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach, which could result in significant costs to us and significant damage to our reputation.
 We are also subject to requirements from the Payment Card Brands, which require us to meet certain security standards in order to achieve certification that allows us to produce and personalize Financial Payment Cards issued on their networks. These standards include extensive requirements with respect to the physical characteristics of our facilities, as well as our electronic treatment and storage of cardholder data. We believe that we have developed significant expertise in acquiring and maintaining these certifications, and have invested significant capital to obtain and retain these designations, which are regularly verified by both the Payment Card Brands and our customers. We believe the long, complex and costly certification process may serve as a significant barrier to new entrants to our market.
 The interpretation of pending and existing laws and regulations is evolving and, therefore, these laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently. It is possible that our current data protection policies and practices may be deemed inconsistent with new legal requirements or interpretations thereof, and breaches in the security of our systems and technology could result in a violation of these laws and regulations. Changes to these laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.
 Financial Services
 We are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks, thrifts, and credit unions. However, as a provider of products and services to these financial institutions, our operations may be examined by various state and federal regulatory authorities and representatives of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, which is a formal inter-agency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions. Also, state and federal regulations require our financial institution clients to include certain provisions in their contracts with service providers like us and to conduct ongoing monitoring and risk management for third party relationships. In addition, we engage independent auditors annually to review certain of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our customers’ auditors.
 In conducting certain of our card services, we are directly subject to various federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to the movement of money. In order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws, we are required, among other things, to comply with licensing and reporting requirements, to implement operating policies and procedures to comply with anti-money laundering laws, to protect the privacy and security of our clients’ information and to undergo periodic audits and examinations.
 In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services industry, including introducing changes that: affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions; provide for a new resolution procedure for large financial companies; introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements; implement changes to corporate governance and executive compensation practices; and require significant rule-making. The Dodd-Frank Act has generated numerous new regulations that have imposed compliance costs. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) which is empowered to conduct rule-making and supervision related to, and enforcement of, federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has issued guidance that applies to “supervised service providers” which the CFPB has defined to include service providers, like us, to CFPB supervised banks and nonbanks. The CFPB has in the past and may in the future issue regulations that may require us to make compliance investments. It is difficult to predict with certainty the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients.
 Employees and Labor
 As of December 31, 2018, our businesses employed approximately 1,100 employees.  We have never experienced any work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes.  We consider our relations with employees to be good.
