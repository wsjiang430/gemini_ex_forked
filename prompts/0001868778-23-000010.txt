ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a leader in data management. Data is foundational to how digital enterprises run their businesses and make strategic decisions, including creating new offerings, serving their customers and driving operational efficiency. We have pioneered a new category of software, the Intelligent Data Management Cloud, or IDMC. Our AI-powered IDMC platform delivers best-of-breed solutions that enables enterprises to create a single source of truth for their data, allowing them to create compelling 360-degree customer experiences, automate data operations across enterprise-wide business processes like supply chain management, financial planning and operations, and provide governed and secure data access to their employees. It also enables our customers to pursue holistic data-driven digital strategies by accelerating workload migrations to the cloud, thus, enabling all the advantages of cloud analytics.
Historically, enterprise data was generated and stored in highly structured, static and monolithic self-managed systems that were only accessed by a few, highly trained individuals and used primarily for analysis and reporting of historical enterprise metrics. Over the course of the last two decades, enterprises have expanded their IT strategies to embrace a wide range of SaaS applications, cloud infrastructure platforms, and more recently cloud data platforms to transform into data-driven digital enterprises.
As enterprises embrace data to modernize their business, data fragmentation has proliferated across a myriad of systems, including cloud and self-managed data warehouses, data lakes, databases and applications. These different data repositories store data in unique formats, both structured and unstructured, with specific characteristics. This data is often consumed and ingested in real time, making it increasingly challenging to aggregate data in a normalized, consistent, and high-quality format. Despite these challenges, as data has become one of the most valuable assets for enterprises and the vast majority of employees are data consumers, it has become embedded in highly complex operational use cases and is at the heart of new data-driven digital strategies.
To address these challenges, we have pioneered a new way for businesses to accurately track where their data resides, understand what relationships exist across their different data repositories, and understand who is accessing the data and how it is being used—all at enterprise scale. Our cloud-native platform leverages over 50,000 metadata-aware connections and 18 petabytes (1 petabyte is comprised of 1,024 terabytes) of active metadata in the cloud that continuously scan our customers’ data to create rich and highly contextualized metadata to create and manage a metadata system of record that acts as a single source of truth about their data. The metadata-aware connections allow our customers to leverage pre-built connectors configured to the data structure of their cloud applications. This allows our AI engine, CLAIRE, to help customers access better data faster, make contextual recommendations about data relationships, uncover novel insights about their business and automate previously manual tasks. As more customers adopt our platform, CLAIRE continuously analyzes new transactions, configurations, rules, and decisions and uses this increased intelligence to drive further automation and deliver better insights to our customers, which in turn we believe will continue to accelerate the adoption of our data management cloud.
Our platform also consists of a wide range of interoperable data management products, including data integration, API and application integration, data quality, master data management, customer and business 360 applications, data catalog, data marketplace, and governance and privacy. These products leverage our platform’s shared services and can be consumed from our SaaS-based cloud offering, which is run on Amazon Web Services ("AWS"), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, and can also be deployed as a self-managed service in our customers’ cloud, hybrid, or on-premises environments. We process mission-critical workloads and the growth of our cloud-based platform has led to the number of cloud transactions on our platform, which is a measure of data processed, increasing from 0.2 trillion per month in 2015, to 53.0 trillion per month as of December 31, 2022. Our cloud annual recurring revenue ("ARR") as of December 31, 2022 was $451.2 million, compared to $317.0 million as of December 31, 2021, representing year-over-year growth of 42%.
Our platform has been adopted by organizations across a wide variety of industries and sizes. We believe data management is an area in which companies are continuing to invest, and we are seeing continued success with our enterprise-focused sales motion. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 5,600 active customers in approximately 100 countries and territories worldwide, including 9 of the Fortune 10, 85 of the Fortune 100 and

912 of the Global 2000. As our customers generate more data, they typically increase their usage of our platform by adding new use cases, adopting more products, or adding more users. We are a strategic partner to our customers in their modernization and digital transformation initiatives. Customers spending more than $100,000 in subscription ARR increased by 15% year-over-year to 1,916 customers and customers spending more than $1 million in subscription ARR increased by 35% year-over-year to 206 customers.
We believe this is a direct result of our relentless focus on customer satisfaction. We received a "Strong" rating in the support/account management category in the 2022 Gartner® Vendor Rating report1. In 2022, the Technology & Services Industry Association® ("TSIA"), the leading association for technology and services association, inducted us into the “Hall of Fame” as a winner in five TSIA STAR award categories since 2020. In 2022, the TSIA also awarded us the 2022 STAR Award for innovation and excellence in three key categories: Customer Growth & Renewal, Customer Success, and Support Services Automation. We also earned the J.D. Power Certified Assisted Technical Support distinction for the second consecutive year. This distinction recognizes us for delivering “An Outstanding Customer Service Experience” to North American customers.
We sell our solutions through a combination of our global direct sales team and a network of strategic partners. Our strategic partners, including cloud hyperscalers, cloud data platforms, global system integrators, and value-added resellers, help extend our sales presence and accelerate the adoption of our platform globally. We collaborate with cloud hyperscalers and cloud data platforms to help our shared customers accelerate their migration to the cloud and modernize their data and analytics strategies.

Sales and Marketing
We sell our solutions primarily through a global direct sales team, which consists of field sales, technical sales, inside sales and partner sales professionals segmented by customer size and region. Our direct sales team is focused both on new customer acquisition and driving expanded use of our products with existing customers, as well as fostering long-term collaborations to drive their multi-year journey to the cloud. The breadth of our platform offerings allows us to engage at many levels of an organization and across many key buying personas and functional centers including, for example, the chief data officer’s organization, the chief information officer’s organization, and line of business buyers like within the chief marketing officer's organization and chief financial officer's organization. The substantial majority of our global sales and marketing efforts are carried out by teams located in North America, EMEA and Japan. In Asia-Pacific, we go to market with a combination of direct sales and channel alliances.
Our marketing strategy is global, data-driven and digital-first, designed to generate awareness of our products and a targeted pipeline of qualified opportunities. Our marketing team combines the creation of inbound demand, to drive traffic to our website and usage of our platform, with direct marketing, business development, and

marketing efforts targeted at business and technology leaders. We believe in a data-driven targeting of all our user personas with personalized content, offers and messaging, including joint go-to-market initiatives with our strategic partners. 
Customer Support and Success
We support our customers through a global customer support and success team consisting of approximately 900 employees as of December 31, 2022, primarily based out of 10 locations worldwide anchored around our major delivery hubs in Redwood City, London and Bangalore. The primary objective of this team is to support our customers; helping them to realize optimal business value from our products by providing the right subject matter expertise to accelerate value creation. Our delivery framework is the right blend of people and technology, powered by a technology platform to interact with our customers and offer digital knowledge assets tailored to the customer persona for in-depth guidance on how to drive business outcomes with Informatica solutions. This team also manages customer renewals, and our renewal rates for subscription and maintenance in 2022 were 94% and 96%, respectively. Our Customer Satisfaction ("CSAT") score for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 4.7/5.0, with approximately 77% of our customers who responded to the survey rating us 5/5. The CSAT score is determined based on an internal survey of customers following the close of any support case, whereby customers rate their experience between 1 and 5 (with 5 being the highest). We achieved a 14% response rate for this survey and therefore the results may not be reflective of our broader customer base.
Research and Development
We manage our research and development costs with strategic development centers across the globe–Redwood City, California; Toronto, Canada; Stuttgart, Germany; Dublin, Ireland; and Bangalore, India. With over 2,200 full-time employees dedicated to research and development as of December 31, 2022, we spend over $300 million annually in research, development and related activities to advance our platform roadmap. On the partnership front, we are heavily invested in joint innovation and joint solutions with the major hyperscalers and cloud platforms (i.e., AWS, Microsoft, Google Cloud Platform, Oracle Cloud, Snowflake, Databricks). For additional information on our technology collaborations, see the section titled “—Our Partners.”
Competition
The markets we serve are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. With the launch of Informatica IDMC, we believe we are the first data management vendor to offer enterprises a single cloud platform serving a comprehensive range of data management requirements. Our competition includes the following:
•Hand-coded custom-built solutions developed by internal IT teams;
•Point solution vendors that compete with one or more of our products;
•Cloud service providers ("CSPs") with limited platform-specific capabilities in data management; and
•Full stack software vendors that compete in the data management solutions market.
We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:
•ability to offer a comprehensive platform with best of breed products;
•interoperability with multi-cloud, hybrid environments and applications;
•ability to embed advanced AI and machine learning in our platform;
•performance, reliability and security;
•ease of deployment and ease of use by the full breadth of data practitioners;
•elasticity and ability to quickly scale services;
•strength of cloud ecosystem partnerships;
•responsiveness to evolving customer needs and use cases;
•success of sales & marketing efforts;
- 15 -


•quality of customer support; and
•brand awareness and reputation.
We believe, based on the factors listed above, that we are favorably positioned relative to our competitors. Nonetheless, some of our competitors have advantages over us, such as greater financial resources, larger sales forces, better brand recognition, longer operating histories, and more expansive geographical footprints. For additional information see section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.”
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding privacy, data protection, data security, data retention and consumer protection, accessibility, sending and storing of electronic messages, human resource services, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, intellectual property and the provision of online payment services, including credit card processing, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, export controls, international sanctions laws, federal securities laws and tax regulations, which are continuously evolving and developing. The manners in which existing laws and regulations are applied to SaaS businesses, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, often are unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as privacy, data protection and security, pricing, advertising, taxation, content regulation and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
In addition, regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning climate-related matters, privacy, data protection, spam, data storage, data localization, content regulation, cybersecurity, sanctions and export controls, government access to personal information and other matters that may be applicable to our business. More countries are enacting and enforcing laws related to the appropriateness of content and enforcing those and other laws by blocking access to services that are found to be out of compliance. It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves, as an increasing portion of our business shifts to the cloud, and as our solutions are used by additional groups, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation.”
Privacy, Data Protection and Security
We place a priority on privacy, data protection and data security. We post on our website our privacy policy, and we maintain certain other policies and practices relating to data security and concerning our processing, use and disclosure of personal information. We use standard contractual clauses issued by the European Commission to conduct transfers of European personal data to jurisdictions not deemed adequate by the European Commission. We collect and use aggregated user information to develop, provide and improve our products. 
Our commitments under the Privacy Shield Principles are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In addition, our publication of our privacy policy and other statements regarding privacy and security may subject us to investigation or enforcement actions by state and federal regulators if they are found to be deficient, lacking transparency, deceptive or misrepresentative of our practices. We also may be bound from time to time by contractual obligations, including standard contractual clauses relating to personal data and business associate agreements that impose certain obligations and restrictions upon us relating to our handling of protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security to which we are subject, as well as their interpretation, are evolving and we expect them to continue to change over time. For example, in 2016 the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), a broad regulation governing data privacy, which became effective in May 2018 and replaced the Data Protection Directive. The GDPR establishes requirements applicable to the handling of personal data and imposes penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of €20,000,000 or 4% of worldwide revenue. In the United Kingdom ("UK"), legislation similar to the GDPR has been adopted that provides for a penalty structure similar to the GDPR. Although the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision for the UK in June 2021 that allows for the continued flow of personal data from the EU to the UK, this decision may be revoked or modified and will need to be renewed after four years from the date of adoption. It remains to be seen how the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU will impact the manner in which United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated and enforced in the longer term.

Additionally, several states have begun enacting new laws relating to privacy and data security. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), among other things, requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt out of certain sales of personal information. Moreover, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA") was approved by California voters in the election on November 3, 2020. The CPRA created obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Other states have also enacted or proposed similar data privacy laws. For example, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut have all enacted legislation that have, or will, become effective in 2023. The effects of the CCPA, CPRA, and other evolving privacy laws in the United States are significant and have required, and may require, us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. More generally, the various privacy, data protection and data security legal obligations that apply to us, and their interpretation and enforcement, may evolve in a manner that relates to our practices or the features of our applications or platform. We may need to take additional measures to comply with the changes in our legal obligations and to maintain and improve our information security posture in an effort to avoid information security incidents or breaches affecting personal information or other sensitive or proprietary data.
Our security policies, procedures, and controls are routinely audited and attested by third parties for compliance, certification, or adherence to industry security standards and regulations, such as SOC 1 Type II, SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, UK Cyber Essentials, ISM Protected, GxP/CGMP and FedRAMP. Our cloud products maintain the American Institute of Certified Public Accounts ("AICPA"), SOC 1® [IICS only], SOC 2®, and SOC 3® attestation reports based on the trust services criteria relevant to security, availability, and confidentiality (applicable trust services criteria) set forth in TSP section 100, 2017 AICPA, Trust Services Criteria, commonly known as the AICPA Systems and Organizational Control (SOC 2®, and SOC 3®). Informatica also maintains compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (HIPAA Security Rule), and the Notification in the Case of Breach of Unsecured Protected Health Information enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (HITECH Breach Notification Requirements), as described in Part 164 of CFR 45, commonly known as HIPAA/HITECH. Our self-managed MDM products and cloud-based Master Data Management ("MDM") products earned Letters of Compliance for GxP, also known as cGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice), relevant to pharmaceutical industries. In November 2021, our MDM Cloud Edition product, operating in the Australia AWS region, earned an ISM Protected letter of compliance. In February 2022, our IICS cloud product - operating in AWS GovCloud, achieved its first FedRAMP Moderate Authorization To Operate ("ATO") sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, and Texas-RAMP Level 2 compliance.
Our information systems and technical infrastructure for cloud services are hosted within SOC 2® attested data centers and utilize a combination of clustering, multiple datacenters and data replication to maintain high availability and resiliency. Our cloud products utilize identity and access controls, multi-factor authentication, real-time security monitoring, and both encryption in transit and encryption at rest to protect customer data using keys unique to each tenant.
Informatica’s security teams focus on proactive application, network and system security, privacy and governance, internal and supply chain risk management, disaster recovery and business resiliency, security consultation, education and incident response. We maintain a documented vulnerability management program that includes periodic scans designed to identify security vulnerabilities on servers, workstations, network infrastructure and applications, and subsequent remediation of vulnerabilities. External security researchers are encouraged to discreetly send us potential security vulnerabilities through our Responsible Disclosure Program, where reporters of qualifying findings are posted to our Security Hall of Fame. In addition, our products and infrastructure are tested regularly through penetration tests using both internal expertise and third-party teams, and any vulnerabilities found are remediated based on risk.
Human Capital Management
Our Values: DATA (Do Good, Act as One Team, Think Customer-First and Aspire & Innovate) are our foundation and define the Informatica experience. With the mutual goals of “delighting our employees and our customers”, we invest with strong intent to the lifecycle journey beginning with recruiting and onboarding, fostering a culture of inclusiveness, diversity, equity and belonging with a focus on growing both the business and our 
- 17 -


employees. Our employees receive competitive compensation and benefit programs, and are recognized in a number of ways, including employee driven appreciation and recognition programs. We frequently survey our employees and work to continually strengthen our culture. Our commitment to our employees has been especially evident during the pandemic, and we have initiated extended work from home/staged opening protocols, with a multitude of programs designed to drive wellness and engagement as well as at home productivity. This commitment has been reflected in strong engagement scores. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had over 6,000 full-time employees, including approximately 2,200 in product development, 1,600 in sales and marketing, 1,600 in operations and customer support, and 600 in general and administrative. As of December 31, 2022, over 4,100 of our employees were located outside the United States, with approximately 2,700 of our employees located in India. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. However, in certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We may be required to comply with the terms of these collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are proud to be a global leader in the promotion and practice of diversity and inclusion. In addition to having offices and employees all over the world, we take pride in and celebrate our cultural diversity. Informatica searches the globe for top talent in an effort to recruit and hire diverse individuals with a variety of skills, experiences, and backgrounds. Our objective is to continue to improve our hiring, development, advancement, and retention of diverse talent and to foster an environment of inclusivity, diversity, equity and belonging ("IDEB"). Our employees are key contributors to supporting our IDEB vision with employee resource groups, postings and education on our IDEB site, organized wide celebrations, speakers, and community outreach.
We require our employees and managers to participate in training programs directed at maintaining a harassment-free, diverse, and secure workplace. With our diverse employee population, we uphold the rights to work in an environment that promotes equal opportunity and prohibits discriminatory practices against race, color, national origin, ancestry, caste, medical condition, religious creed (including religious dress and grooming practices), marital status, registered domestic partner status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, genetic characteristics and information, age, veteran status, or any other protected characteristic. We are committed to cultivating a respectful workplace and preventing harassment in all its forms.
Health and Safety
We recognize that a healthy environment and safe workplaces are critical to our business, strategy, and communities. We address environmental issues in an integrated manner to encompass protection of the environment as well as the health and safety of our workforce. For example, in response to COVID-19 and the significant increases in remote workforces in March 2020, we mandated a work-from-home policy to protect our employees, families, customers, and our communities.
While our employees have been working remotely throughout most of 2020 and 2021, in 2022 we began the process of reopening our buildings and returning employees to the workplace. We are committed to the health and safety of our employees and their families and are taking precautions to ensure employees have a smooth and safe transition. We recognize that providing our teams with some flexibility to decide whether they want to work in office, remotely, or a combination of both, is critical for supporting their mental and physical well-being. We will continue to explore opportunities for providing an engaging and connected culture regardless of where our teams work.
Our workforce continues to operate remotely where necessary, and it remains our priority to provide support for our employees, partners, and customers. We are fortunate that the nature of our business allowed us to successfully operate on a work-from-home basis and in this new dynamic hybrid environment. We have been able to successfully adapt to the current challenges and deliver results despite the pandemic while continuing to protect the health and safety of our workforce and customers.

Compensation and Benefits
We provide robust market-based compensation and benefits to our employees. In addition to competitive base salaries, all qualified employees are eligible for variable pay and to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). 
To support the health and wellness of our workforce, we offer premium health coverage with minimal out-of-pocket contributions for our global employees as well as a number of other welfare programs for added security. Employees also are well supported in their time-off needs.
Training and Development
We believe every employee can make a difference and can shape their career at Informatica, so we empower them in their roles to explore various career paths. We assist employees as they grow in a role in general career advancement with access to both on-line, classroom and virtual training. Employees have access to both a rich array of technical and professional development opportunities.
Communication and Engagement
Frequent and transparent communications are paramount at Informatica to engage and inform our teams. We utilize multiple communication channels to ensure our employees and managers receive timely information regarding the business strategy, product and service releases, financial results and priorities; as well as how to stay connected.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret rights, confidentiality procedures, and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As of December 31, 2022, we had 23 patent applications filed and 114 patents issued in a variety of jurisdictions. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through February 2041. In addition, we have registered identifiers important to our business including “Informatica” and “CLAIRE” as trademarks in the United States and other jurisdictions. We are also the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “Informatica” and similar variations. In addition to the protections provided by our intellectual property rights, as part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, distributors, and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Where appropriate, we have also entered into patent cross-license agreements with third parties, thereby acquiring additional intellectual property rights which preserve our ability to pursue normal business activity and minimize our risks in entering new and adjacent technology markets.
Nonetheless, our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors will try to develop products and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third parties may also claim that our platform infringes their intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers or channel partners, whom our license or other agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from offering certain services or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected subscriptions or services, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly higher profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. We are not aware of any current infringement of any third-party patents or other proprietary rights by us, although we cannot guarantee this is the case. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business. For a further discussion of our intellectual property rights, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
