Item 1.     Business
General
Cactus, Inc. (“Cactus Inc.”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “Cactus”), including Cactus Wellhead, LLC (“Cactus LLC”), are primarily engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of wellhead and pressure control equipment. Our products are sold and rented principally for onshore unconventional oil and gas wells and are utilized during the drilling, completion and production phases of our customers’ wells. We also provide field services for all of our products and rental items to assist with the installation, maintenance and handling of the wellhead and pressure control equipment. Additionally, we offer repair and refurbishment services. We operate through 15 U.S. service centers located in Texas, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming as well as three service centers in Eastern Australia. We also provide rental and field service operations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our corporate headquarters are located in Houston, Texas. We also have manufacturing and production facilities in Bossier City, Louisiana and Suzhou, China.
Cactus Inc. was incorporated on February 17, 2017 as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of completing an initial public offering of equity and related transactions, which was completed on February 12, 2018 (our “IPO”). We began operating in August 2011 following the formation of Cactus LLC in part by Scott Bender and Joel Bender, who have owned or operated wellhead manufacturing businesses since the late 1970s. Cactus Inc. is a holding company whose only material asset is an equity interest consisting of units representing limited liability company interests in Cactus LLC (“CW Units”). Cactus Inc. became the sole managing member of Cactus LLC upon completion of our IPO and is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to Cactus LLC’s business. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of Cactus LLC (the “Cactus Wellhead LLC Agreement”), owners of CW Units are entitled to redeem their CW Units for shares of Cactus Inc.’s Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class A common stock”) on a one-for-one basis, which results in a corresponding increase in Cactus Inc.’s membership interest in Cactus LLC and an increase in the number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding. We refer to the owners of CW Units, other than Cactus Inc. (along with their permitted transferees), as “CW Unit Holders.” CW Unit Holders own one share of our Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class B common stock”) for each CW Unit such CW Unit Holder owns. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Cactus WH Enterprises, LLC (“Cactus WH Enterprises”) is the largest CW Unit Holder. Cactus WH Enterprises is a Delaware limited liability company owned by Scott Bender, Joel Bender, Steven Bender and certain other employees. Cadent Energy Partners II, L.P. (“Cadent”), an affiliate of Cadent Energy Partners LLC, owned more than 10% of issued and outstanding CW Units until March 2021, when it redeemed 4,111,250 of the CW Units (together with an equal number of shares of Class B common stock) owned by it in connection with the March 2021 offer and sale by certain selling stockholders of Class A common stock. Subsequently, in a series of additional transactions throughout 2021, Cadent and its affiliates transferred or redeemed the remainder of its CW Units. The redeemed CW Units were redeemed for Class A common stock, with such shares being distributed to their owners pro rata.
As of December 31, 2022, Cactus Inc. owned 80.3% and CW Unit Holders owned 19.7% of Cactus LLC, which was based on 60.9 million shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding and 15.0 million shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding. Cactus WH Enterprises held approximately 17.6% of our voting power as of December 31, 2022. Following a public offering completed on January 13, 2023, Cactus Inc. owned 81.1% and CW Unit Holders owned 18.9% of Cactus LLC, which was based on 64.1 million shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding and 15.0 million shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding. Cactus WH Enterprises held approximately 16.9% of our voting power as of the completion of such offering.
Since our IPO in February 2018, 45.6 million CW Units and a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock have been redeemed in exchange for shares of Class A common stock. The following is a rollforward of ownership of 
legacy CW Units by CW Unit Holders for the three years ended December 31, 2022:
 | CW Units 
 | (in thousands)
CW Units held by legacy CW Unit Holders as of December 31, 2019 | 27,958 
CW Unit redemptions | (303) 
CW Units held by legacy CW Unit Holders as of December 31, 2020 | 27,655 
Follow-on equity offering in March 2021 | (6,273)

For a detailed discussion of significant 2021 activity and redemptions, See Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following diagram indicates our simplified ownership structure as of December 31, 2022:
Acquisition of FlexSteel
On December 30, 2022, Cactus Inc. and its newly-formed subsidiary, Atlas Merger Sub, LLC, entered into a definitive agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) to acquire HighRidge on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Merger closed on February 28, 2023 whereby Atlas Merger Sub, LLC merged into HighRidge, with HighRidge being the surviving entity. HighRidge’s primary purpose was to own 100% of the equity in FlexSteel Holdings, Inc. Subsequent to the Merger, FlexSteel Holdings, Inc. was converted into a limited liability company, now named FlexSteel Holdings, LLC (previously defined as “FlexSteel”). Also subsequent to the Merger, Cactus Inc. contributed HighRidge to Cactus Acquisitions LLC (“Cactus Acquisitions”), a newly created entity, whereby HighRidge was converted into a limited liability company. Finally, Cactus Acquisitions contributed FlexSteel to Cactus Companies (defined below) which had previously acquired all of the outstanding units of Cactus LLC in exchange for an equal number of CC Units (defined below) prior to the Merger closing. 
 FlexSteel is a leading manufacturer and provider of differentiated onshore spoolable pipe technologies and associated installation services. FlexSteel operates through service centers and pipe yards located throughout the United States and Canada, while also providing equipment and services in select international markets. FlexSteel has a manufacturing facility in Baytown, Texas. We believe this acquisition enhances Cactus’ position as a premier manufacturer and provider of highly engineered equipment to the E&P industry and expands our reach further downstream. We also believe FlexSteel’s products are highly complementary to Cactus’ equipment at the wellsite and provides meaningful growth potential for Cactus.
We acquired HighRidge on a cash-free, debt-free basis, for a purchase price of approximately $621.2 million, subject to certain working capital, debt and other customary adjustments set forth in the Merger Agreement. In addition to the upfront consideration, there is a potential future earn-out payment of up to $75 million to be paid no later than the third quarter of 2024, if certain revenue growth targets are met by FlexSteel. We funded the upfront purchase price using a combination of $165.6 million of net proceeds received from a public offering of shares of our Class A common stock completed on January 13, 2023, borrowings under the Amended ABL Credit Facility (as defined in Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and available cash on hand at the time of closing.
Internal Reorganization and Current Ownership Structure
On February 27, 2023, in order to facilitate the Merger, an internal reorganization (the “CC Reorganization”) was completed in which Cactus Companies, LLC (“Cactus Companies”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cactus Inc. formed on February 6, 2023, acquired all of the outstanding units representing ownership interests in the operating subsidiary of Cactus Inc., Cactus LLC, in exchange for an equal number of units representing limited liability company interests in Cactus Companies (“CC Units”) issued to each of the previous owners of CW Units. Cactus Inc. is a holding company whose only material asset is a direct and indirect equity interest consisting of CC Units following the completion of the CC Reorganization (which were CW Units from the IPO until the CC Reorganization). Cactus Inc. was the sole managing member of Cactus LLC upon completion of our IPO until the CC Reorganization and became the sole managing member of Cactus Companies upon completion of the CC Reorganization. In connection with the CC Reorganization, Cactus Inc., Cactus Acquisitions and the remaining owners of CC Units entered into the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of Cactus Companies (the “Cactus Companies LLC Agreement”), which contains substantially the same terms and conditions as the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of Cactus LLC (the “Cactus Wellhead LLC Agreement”), which was the limited liability company operating agreement of Cactus LLC prior to the CC Reorganization. Cactus Inc. was responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to Cactus LLC’s business for the period from completion of our IPO until the CC Reorganization and for the Cactus Companies’ business for periods after the CC Reorganization.
From the completion of our IPO until the CC Reorganization, pursuant to the Cactus Wellhead LLC Agreement, owners of CW Units were entitled to redeem their CW Units for shares of Cactus Inc.’s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, which would have resulted in a corresponding increase in Cactus Inc.’s membership interest in Cactus LLC and an increase in the number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding. After the CC Reorganization, we refer to the owners of CC Units, other than Cactus Inc. (along with their permitted transferees), as “CC Unit Holders.” From the completion of our IPO until the CC Reorganization, CW Unit Holders owned one share of our Class B common stock for each CW Unit such CW Unit Holder owned and, upon the completion of the CC Reorganization, such CW Unit Holders ceased to be holders of CW Units and, instead, became holders of a number of CC Units equal to the number of CW Units such CW Unit Holders held immediately prior to the completion of the CC Reorganization. Following the completion of the CC Reorganization, CC Unit Holders own one share of our Class B Common Stock for each CC Unit such CC Unit Holder owns and Cactus Companies is the sole member of Cactus LLC. Pursuant to the Cactus Companies LLC Agreement, owners of CC Units are entitled to redeem their CC Units for shares of Cactus Inc.’s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, which would result in a corresponding 
increase in Cactus Inc.’s membership interest in Cactus Companies and an increase in the number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding.
Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock continue to vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Cactus WH Enterprises remains the largest CC Unit Holder following the completion of the CC Reorganization.
As of February 28, 2023, following completion of the CC Reorganization, Cactus Inc. owned 81.1% through direct and indirect ownership of Cactus Companies and the CC Unit Holders owned 18.9%, which was based on 64.1 million shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding and 15.0 million shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding. Cactus WH Enterprises held approximately 16.9% of our voting power as of February 28, 2023. 
The following diagram indicates our simplified ownership structure immediately following the completion of the CC Reorganization:
The remainder of this “Item 1. Business” section specifically excludes the impact of the FlexSteel acquisition unless otherwise noted, as it was not a part of our business prior to December 31, 2022. Additional details on the business can be found in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 3, 2023 announcing the signing of the Merger Agreement. 
Our Products
Our principal products include our Cactus SafeDrill® wellhead systems as well as frac stacks, our Cactus SafeLink® monobore, SafeClamp® and SafeInject® systems, zipper manifolds and production trees that we design and manufacture. Every oil and gas well requires a wellhead system, which is installed throughout the drilling process and remains with the well through its entire productive life. The Cactus SafeDrill® wellhead systems employ technology which allows technicians to land and secure casing strings more safely from the rig floor, reducing the need to descend into the cellar. We believe we are a market leader in the application of such technology, with thousands of our products sold and installed across the United States since 2011. During the completion phase of a well, we rent frac stacks, zipper manifolds and other high-pressure equipment including our SafeLink®, SafeClamp® and SafeInject® systems that are used for well control and managing the transmission of frac fluids and proppants during the hydraulic fracturing process. These severe service applications require robust and reliable equipment. Cactus, through its proprietary equipment, digital offerings and services, reduces the need for human intervention in the exclusion zone, minimizing non-productive time and leading to inherently safer and more environmentally responsible operations. For the subsequent production phase of a well, we sell production trees and equipment which are installed on the wellhead after the frac stack has been removed. In addition, we provide mission-critical field services for all of our products and rental items, including 24-hour service crews to assist with the installation, maintenance, repair and safe handling of the wellhead and pressure control equipment. Our innovative wellhead products and pressure control equipment are developed internally.
We believe that customers select our products, among other reasons, due to brand name recognition associated with our engineered products, which we believe is due to our focus on safety, reliability, cost effectiveness and time saving features. We optimize our products for pad drilling (i.e., the process of drilling multiple wellbores from a single surface location) to reduce rig time and provide operators with significant efficiencies that translate into increased safety, reduced environmental impact and cost savings at the wellsite.
We primarily operate through service centers in the United States, which are strategically located in the key oil and gas producing regions, including the Permian, Marcellus, Utica, Haynesville, Eagle Ford, Bakken and SCOOP/STACK, among other active oil and gas regions in the United States, and in Eastern Australia. These service centers support our field services and provide equipment assembly and repair services. We also conduct rental and field service operations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our manufacturing and production facilities are located in Bossier City, Louisiana and Suzhou, China.
Our Revenues
We operate in one business segment. Our revenues are derived from three sources: products, rentals, and field service and other. Product revenues are primarily derived from the sale of wellhead systems and production trees. Rental revenues are primarily derived from the rental of equipment used during the completion process, the repair of such equipment and the rental of tools used during drilling operations. Field service and other revenues are primarily earned when we provide installation and other field services for both product sales and equipment rental. Additionally, other revenues are derived from providing repair and reconditioning services to customers that have previously purchased wellheads or production trees. Items sold or rented generally have an associated service component. As a result, there is a close correlation between field service and other revenues and revenues from product sales and rentals.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we derived 66% of our total revenues from the sale of our products, 14% from rental and 20% from field service and other. In 2021, we derived 64% of our total revenues from the sale of our products, 14% from rental and 22% from field service and other. In 2020, we derived 59% of our total revenues from the sale of our products, 19% from rental and 22% from field service and other. We have predominantly domestic operations, with a small amount of sales in select international markets.
Most of our sales are made on a call out basis pursuant to agreements, wherein our clients provide delivery instructions for goods and/or services as their operations require. Such goods and services are most often priced in accordance with a preapproved price list. The actual pricing of our products and services is impacted by a number of factors including competitive pricing pressure, the value perceived by our customers, the level of utilized capacity in the oil service sector, cost of manufacturing the product, cost of providing the service and general market conditions.
Costs of Conducting Our Business
The principal elements of cost of sales for our products are the direct and indirect costs to manufacture and supply the product, including labor, materials, machine time, tariffs and duties, freight and lease expenses related to our facilities. The principal elements of cost of sales for rentals are the direct and indirect costs of supplying rental equipment, including 
depreciation, repairs specifically performed on such rental equipment and freight. The principal elements of cost of sales for field service and other are labor, equipment depreciation and repair, equipment and vehicle lease expenses, fuel and supplies. Selling, general and administrative expense is comprised of costs such as sales and marketing, engineering, general corporate overhead, business development, compensation, employment benefits, insurance, information technology, safety and environmental, legal and professional.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
Forgings, castings, tube and bar stock represent the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products and rental equipment. In addition, we require accessory items (such as elastomers, ring gaskets, studs and nuts) and machined components. We purchase a majority of these items from vendors primarily located in the United States, China, India and Australia. During each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, no vendor represented 10% or more of our total third-party vendor purchases of raw materials, finished products, components, equipment, machining and other services. We do not believe that we are overly dependent on any individual vendor to supply our required materials or services. The materials and services essential to our business are normally readily available and, where we use one or a few vendors as a source of any particular materials or services, we believe that we can, within a reasonable period of time, make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of an interruption of supply from any vendor. We believe our materials and services vendors have the capacity to meet additional demand should we require it, although at higher costs and with extended deliveries.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing and production facilities are located in Bossier City, Louisiana and Suzhou, China. Although both facilities can produce our full range of products, our Bossier City facility has advanced capabilities and is designed to support time-sensitive and rapid turnaround of made-to-order equipment, while our facility in China is optimized for longer lead time orders and outsources its machining requirements. The facilities are licensed to the latest American Petroleum Institute (“API”) 6A specification for wellheads and valves and API Q1 and ISO 9001:2015 quality management systems. Where traditional manufacturing facilities are designed to run in batches with different machining processes occurring in stages, our Bossier City facility uses advanced computer numeric 5 Axis control machines to perform multiple machining operations with fewer set-ups. We believe eliminating the queue times between machining operations allows us to offer significantly shorter order-to-delivery times compared to our competitors, albeit at higher costs than our facility in China. Responsiveness to urgent needs strengthens our relationship with key customers. The Bossier City facility has the ability to perform phosphate and oil coating, copper coating and frac rental equipment remanufacturing. Our production facility in China is configured to efficiently produce our range of pressure control products and components for less time-sensitive, higher-volume orders. The Suzhou facility assembles and tests finished and semi-finished machined components before shipment to the United States, Australia and other international locations. Our Suzhou subsidiary is wholly-owned, and its facility is staffed by Cactus employees, which we believe is a key factor in ensuring high quality and dependable deliveries.
Trademarks and Patents
Trademarks are important to the marketing of our products. We consider the Cactus Wellhead trademark to be important to our business as a whole. The Company has numerous trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and has also applied for registration status of several trademarks which are pending. Once registered, our trademarks can be renewed every 10 years as long as we are using them in commerce. We also seek to protect our technology through use of patents, which affords us 20 years of protection of our proprietary inventions and technology, although we do not deem patents to be critical to our success. We have been awarded several U.S. patents and currently have additional patent applications pending. We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. To protect our information, we customarily enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and suppliers. There can be no assurance, however, that others will not independently obtain similar information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. 
Cyclicality
We are substantially dependent on conditions in the oil and gas industry, including the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been volatile, and by the availability of capital and the associated capital spending discipline exercised by customers. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could negatively affect the level of these activities and capital spending, which could adversely affect demand for our products and services and, in certain instances, result in the 
cancellation, modification or rescheduling of existing and expected orders and the ability of our customers to pay us for our products and services. These factors could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.
Seasonality
Our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality, although our fourth quarter has historically been impacted by holidays and our customers’ budget cycles.
Customers
We serve over 200 customers representing private operators, publicly-traded independents, majors and other companies with operations in the key U.S. oil and gas producing basins as well as in Australia, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other international locations. No customer represented more than 10% of total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2022. One customer represented approximately 12% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2021, whereas no customer represented 10% or more of total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We believe we are one of the largest suppliers of wellheads used in the United States. We compete with divisions of Schlumberger and TechnipFMC, as well as a large number of other companies. We believe the rental market for frac stacks and related flow control equipment is more fragmented than the wellhead product market. Cactus does not believe any individual company represents more than 20% of the U.S. rental market. 
We believe the competitive factors in the markets we serve include technical features, equipment availability, work force competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, continuity of management and price. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment. While we seek to be competitive in our pricing, we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on product performance, features, safety and availability, as well as the quality of our people, equipment and services. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest‑quality services and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
We are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and other countries, pertaining to protection of the environment and occupational safety and health. Compliance with environmental legal requirements in the United States at the federal, state or local levels may require acquiring permits to conduct regulated activities, incurring capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions, discharges and any unauthorized releases, and complying with stringent practices to handle, recycle and dispose of certain wastes. These laws and regulations include, among others:
•the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”);
•the Clean Air Act;
•the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act;
•the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act;
•the Occupational Safety and Health Act; and
•national and local environmental protection laws in Australia, the People’s Republic of China and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
New, modified or stricter enforcement of environmental laws and regulations could be adopted or implemented that significantly increase our compliance costs, pollution mitigation costs, or the cost of any remediation of environmental contamination that may become necessary, and these costs could be material. Our customers are also subject to most, if not all, of the same laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health in the United States and in foreign countries where we operate. Consequently, to the extent these environmental compliance costs, pollution mitigation costs or remediation costs are incurred by our customers, those customers could elect to delay, reduce or cancel drilling, exploration or production programs, which could reduce demand for our products and services and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Consistent with our quality assurance and Health, Safety & Environment (“HSE”) principles, we have established proactive environmental and worker safety policies in the United States and foreign countries for the management, handling, recycling or disposal of chemicals and 
gases and other materials and wastes resulting from our operations. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
Licenses and Certifications. Our manufacturing facility in Bossier City, Louisiana and our production facility in Suzhou, China are currently licensed by the API to monogram manufactured products in accordance with API 6A, 21st Edition product specification for both wellheads and valves while the quality management system is certified to API Q1, 9th Edition and ISO 9001:2015. These licenses and certifications expire every three years and are renewed upon successful completion of annual audits. Cactus has also developed an API Q2 program specific to our service business. At this time, we have not yet applied for API Q2 certification, but we are implementing the API Q2 Quality Management System at select service locations to reduce well site non-productive time, improve service tool reliability and enhance customer satisfaction and retention. Our current API licenses and certifications are published on our website under the “Quality Assurance & Control” section of our website at www.CactusWHD.com. API’s standards are subject to revision, however, and there is no guarantee that future amendments or substantive changes to the standards would not require us to modify our operations or manufacturing processes to meet the new standards. Doing so may materially affect our operational costs. We also cannot guarantee that changes to the standards would not lead to the rescission of our licenses should we be unable to make the changes necessary to meet the new standards. Loss of our API licenses could materially affect demand for these products.
Hydraulic Fracturing. Most of our customers utilize hydraulic fracturing in their operations. Environmental concerns have been raised regarding the potential impact of hydraulic fracturing and the resulting wastewater disposal on underground water supplies and seismic activity. These concerns have led to several regulatory and governmental initiatives in the United States to restrict the hydraulic fracturing process, which could have an adverse impact on our customers’ completions or production activities. Although we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing, our products are used in hydraulic fracturing. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. In December 2021, the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the state’s oil and gas industry, suspended the use of deep wastewater disposal wells in four oil-producing counties in West Texas. The suspension is intended to mitigate earthquakes thought to be caused by the injection of waste fluids, including saltwater, that are a byproduct of hydraulic fracturing into disposal wells. The ban will require oil and gas production companies to find other options to handle the wastewater, which may include piping or trucking it longer distances to other locations not under the ban. In addition, the Texas Railroad Commission has overseen the development of well-operator-led response plans to reduce injection volumes in other portions of West Texas in order to reduce seismicity in these areas. The adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal, state, local or foreign level imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, delaying or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process or other processes on which hydraulic fracturing and subsequent hydrocarbon production relies, such as water disposal, could make it more difficult to complete oil and natural gas wells. Further, it could increase our customers’ costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services for which they contract, which could negatively impact demand for our products.
Climate Change. State, national and foreign governments and agencies continue to evaluate, and in some instances adopt, climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases. Changes in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases, climate change and alternative energy sources may negatively impact demand for our services. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements, including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns. In January 2021, the Acting Secretary of the Department of the Interior issued an order suspending new leasing and drilling permits for fossil fuel production on federal lands and waters for 60 days. President Biden then issued an executive order indefinitely suspending new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. While the United States Department of the Interior announced in April 2022 that it would resume oil and gas leasing on public lands, the topic of oil and gas leasing on public land remains politically fraught, as the announcement indicated that federal land available for oil and gas leasing will be significantly reduced due to environmental and climate concerns. To the extent that these developments or other initiatives to reform federal leasing practices result in the development of additional restrictions on drilling, limitations on the availability of leases, or restrictions on the ability to obtain required permits, it could impact our customers’ opportunities and reduce demand for our products and services in the aforementioned areas. 
Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, may reduce demand for oil and natural gas and could have a negative impact on our business. Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial position. In addition, our business could be impacted by initiatives to address greenhouse gases and climate change and incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources. For example, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act 
of 2022 (the “Inflation Reduction Act”) was signed into law. The Inflation Reduction Act appropriates significant federal funding for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration, amongst other provisions. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act imposes the first ever federal fee on the emission of greenhouse gases (“GHG”) through a methane emissions charge. The Inflation Reduction Act amends the federal Clean Air Act to impose a fee on the emission of methane from sources required to report their GHG emissions to the EPA, including those sources in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production categories. These developments could further accelerate the transition of the U.S. economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower- or zero-carbon emissions alternatives, which could reduce demand for our products and services and negatively impact our business.
Insurance and Risk Management
We rely on customer indemnifications and third‑party insurance as part of our risk mitigation strategy. However, our customers may be unable to satisfy indemnification claims against them. In addition, we indemnify our customers against certain claims and liabilities resulting or arising from our provision of goods or services to them. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or may not cover all losses. We carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations, and we are partially self‑insured for certain claims, in amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable. Historically, insurance rates have been subject to various market fluctuations that may result in less coverage, increased premium costs, or higher deductibles or self‑insured retentions.
Our insurance includes coverage for commercial general liability, damage to our real and personal property, damage to our mobile equipment, sudden and accidental pollution liability, workers’ compensation and employer’s liability, auto liability, foreign package policy, commercial crime, fiduciary liability employment practices, cargo, excess liability, and directors and officers’ insurance. We also maintain a partially self-insured medical plan that utilizes specific and aggregate stop loss limits. Our insurance includes various limits and deductibles or self‑insured retentions, which must be met prior to, or in conjunction with, recovery.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, we employed over 1,200 people worldwide (not including employees of FlexSteel), of which approximately 1,000 were employed in the United States. FlexSteel employed 350 people as of December 31, 2022, with 340 employed in the United States and 10 in Canada. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our workforce to be good. Our business’s success depends mainly on our ability to attract, retain and motivate a diverse population of talented employees at all levels of our organization, including the individuals who comprise our global workforce, executive officers and other key personnel. To succeed in a competitive industry, we have developed key recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures which we focus on as part of the overall management of our business.
Recruiting. Our talent strategy is focused on attracting the best talent and rewarding their performance while developing and retaining them. When hiring, we utilize employee referrals, a variety of social media platforms, regional job fairs and partner with educational organizations across the United States to find diverse, qualified, motivated and responsible candidates. Additionally, we work with local workforce commissions to ensure we are attracting a diverse and qualified pool of candidates for each region in which we operate. 
Training and Development. We are dedicated to our employees’ training and development, especially those in field and branch operations. Our internal training focuses on safety, corporate and personal responsibility, product knowledge, behavioral development and ethical conduct. Cactus maintains an internal database to track training progress and completion for all of our associates, with a particular interest in tracking the training and skill sets of our field service technicians and managers. This tracking tool enables us to take a holistic view of our strengths by branch and job title, which helps us to manage our operations and assign jobs to associates with the proper skills, training and experience to safely and efficiently meet or exceed customer demand. Other training courses offered outside of the company are attended by employees with specialized skills, knowledge or certifications as needed for their ongoing success and professional development. We believe our continued focus on training and development translates into a safer work environment, opportunities to promote within the organization, improved employee morale and increased employee retention.
 Compensation and Benefits. We provide compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees and their families. In addition to salaries and wages, these programs (which vary by country) include annual bonuses, retirement plans such as a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings accounts partially funded by the Company, standard flexible spending accounts, personal legal services insurance, company-sponsored long and short term 
disability, accident and critical illness, paid time off, family leave, partially paid maternity and paternity leave, family care resources and employee assistance programs, among others. We also offer tuition reimbursement in certain circumstances to support our employees’ continued growth and development. Additionally, we use targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate the retention of key personnel.
Health and Safety. Our health and safety programs are designed around global standards with appropriate variations addressing the multiple jurisdictions and regulations, specific hazards and unique working environments of our manufacturing and production facilities, service centers and headquarters. We require each location to conduct regular safety evaluations to verify that expectations for safety program procedures and training are being met. We also engage in third party conformity assessments of our HSE processes to determine adherence to our HSE management system and to global health and safety standards. We monitor our Occupational Safety and Health Administration Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) to assess our operation’s health and safety performance. TRIR is defined as the number of incidents per 100 full-time employees that have resulted in a recordable injury or illness in the pertinent period. During fiscal year 2022, we had a TRIR of 1.35, which compares to 1.29 in 2021. We had no work-related fatalities in either year. Based on the most recent statistics available from the International Association of Drilling Contractors, our TRIR statistics are in line with the industry average.
We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families access to various flexible and convenient health and wellness programs. These programs include benefits that offer protection and security to have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or impact their financial well-being. These tools also support their physical and mental health by providing resources to improve or maintain their health status. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented additional safety measures for employees performing critical on-site work as well as offering vaccination clinics and testing as necessary.
