ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Overview
Rackspace Technology is a leading end-to-end multicloud technology services company. We design, build, and operate our customers’ cloud environments across all major technology platforms, irrespective of technology stack or deployment model. We partner with our customers at every stage of their cloud journey, enabling them to modernize applications, build new products and adopt innovative technologies.
Cloud technology is reinventing how companies store, process and manage their data.
Businesses have accelerated their adoption of cloud technologies in recent years due to:
•Strong growth in highly variable, high-scale workloads (a computing task performed by a business application) such as mobile applications, device telemetry and associated marketing, tracking and data. Those workloads have also driven an explosion of data volumes. All of these workloads run more efficiently in the flexible, agile, variable-cost environment of cloud technologies with its associated highly scaled data storage.
•The need to compete with “digital natives” (technology companies that began their existence online in the digital age and do not have legacy infrastructure or technology to maintain and support).
•The emergence of cloud-based business tools, such as data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, that help companies optimize business performance.
•A global pandemic that challenged companies to accommodate an increasingly remote workforce. 
In addition, the cost to maintain a company-owned data center (known in industry parlance as “on-premises” or “on-prem” data centers) has become cost prohibitive since companies must constantly upgrade hardware, maintain physical infrastructure and constantly apply security patches to counteract emerging security threats. Companies are also looking to reduce their on-premises operations budgets to fund the build-out of their cloud management operations and skill base.
At the same time, several dominant players have emerged in the cloud computing industry: the “hyperscalers” – AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, which are the leading public cloud providers; as well as VMware, which is a leading provider of private cloud technology. These technology providers operate cloud environments at a massive scale and have a significant cost-benefit advantage compared to a company-owned on-prem data center. They can also easily invest billions of dollars in product development and innovation, maintenance of the physical infrastructure and upkeep of important security protocols and technology.
As a result of these developments, most companies will become increasingly dependent on cloud technologies for most of their new workloads, as well as a portion of existing workloads, over the coming years.
The multicloud paradigm brings additional complexity for businesses moving to the cloud.
Moving to the cloud is not as simple as selecting a single platform and migrating data. The cloud is taking market share because it is a structurally different platform with structurally different cost dynamics. Oftentimes, new code must be written, or existing code must be re-written, to take full advantage of cloud capabilities. Likewise, simply moving existing code to the cloud (known as “lifting and shifting”) can often result in high or unforeseen cost over-runs. The efficiencies of cloud are real, but it takes substantial effort to realize them.
Companies also face the challenge of managing multiple clouds. They often employ more than one cloud solution for several business reasons:
•to prevent lock-in with any one cloud provider;
•to ensure data storage redundancy and protect against business interruption;
•to provide for enhanced security, compliance and governance;
•to access business tools that may run better on one cloud platform versus another; or
- 7 -


•to accommodate past decisions related to prior deployments and/or acquisitions, both of which can force most large companies into managing workloads situated on multiple clouds.
In addition, some business applications cannot migrate to the cloud and must remain on mature cloud platforms like private cloud, or even on-prem data centers, for various reasons: 
•Corporate governance requires data sovereignty for sensitive data such as financial or health information.
•Older applications, often built in-house on older code, are not cloud-ready, and the cost of modernizing or replacing them outweighs the benefits of moving to the cloud.
•Data egress fees (fees charged by the hyperscalers for moving data out of their storage environment) have highlighted the need to keep frequently-accessed data on non-hyperscaler platforms.
As a result, businesses quickly find themselves in a multicloud paradigm that includes two or more hyperscaler platforms, private cloud and data and applications that are hosted on-premises or in a colocation or managed hosting facility. In such a complex environment, even the most sophisticated IT organizations at the largest multinational companies require outside resources to manage their multicloud presence.
Rackspace Technology is a leading pure-play cloud solutions company.
We help companies of all sizes manage their transition to the cloud, make sense of their IT infrastructure, migrate their data to the cloud, optimize their cloud presence on an ongoing basis and manage the workloads best left to managed hosting or other mature platforms.
Few companies have the internal resources required to effectively manage a transition to the cloud. Building a well-rounded and capable in-house team would require hiring experts on all three hyperscaler platforms as well as private cloud, colocation and managed hosting. We believe professionals with these skill sets are challenging for companies to source and hire because they generally prefer to work at a technology company. We believe this creates an opportunity for a service partner like Rackspace Technology which enables businesses to fully embrace the power of all cloud technologies.
Our team of 6,800 highly skilled Rackers, including consultants and engineers, partners with companies at every stage of their cloud transformation journey and helps them: 
•select the right platforms for their business needs;
•manage the movement of applications and data to the cloud and re-hosting of applications best suited for managed hosting;
•strategically locate and manage growing volumes of associated data storage to minimize cost and business risk;
•optimize their cloud footprint by leveraging new offerings and new pricing models from the hyperscalers, as well as new cloud computing technologies; 
•operate their cloud environment;
•monitor security and ensure the security infrastructure is kept up to date;
•modernize their legacy business applications so they are optimized to run in the cloud; and
•mine their business data for actionable insights using cloud data analytics tools.
We aim to be our customers’ most trusted advisor and services partner in their path to cloud transformation and to accelerate the value of their cloud investments. We give customers the ability to make informed decisions when choosing the right technologies, and we recommend solutions based on each customer’s unique objectives. In this way, we empower our customers to harness the full benefits of cloud adoption.
We differentiate ourselves from other service providers by:
•focusing solely on the cloud as the only pure play cloud solutions company;
•automating much of the manual labor to reduce cost for our customers;
•providing our renowned Fanatical Experience for our customers;
- 8 -


•maintaining close relationships with the major cloud providers – AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and VMware; and
•providing a full suite of cloud services across public and private cloud, as well as managed hosting and colocation services, so that enterprises can cost-effectively maintain legacy applications that are not cloud-ready while migrating their business to the cloud gradually.
We have a culture of innovation that permeates all that we do. Our Rackers gather insights from customers, cloud partners and each other to design, implement and operate advanced cloud environments. With our deep technical expertise, we build solutions alongside our customers to solve their most complex business challenges and explore their most promising business opportunities. Our tight-knit relationships with leading cloud partners enable Rackers to be on the front lines of cloud technology and among the first to utilize the latest capabilities of the cloud when our cloud partners launch new solutions. Our partnerships, Rackers and culture combine to ensure that we are at the forefront of major trends in technology, including cloud native application development, Internet of Things and containers. We believe this expertise - and our ability to deliver it effectively - enables our customers to innovate faster and stay ahead of their competition.
Rackspace Fabric, our proprietary cloud software, is a significant differentiator.
Rackspace Fabric is the proprietary software that underpins our industry-leading automation. It includes over 200 unique tools and components to deliver our services and represents an investment of over $1 billion and 12 million hours of highly skilled professionals' time. We believe it gives us a sustainable competitive advantage that would be difficult, if not impossible, for a competitor to replicate. Rackspace Fabric serves as a single pane of glass through which customers can manage their entire cloud presence and delivers automation, artificial intelligence, predictive analytics and proprietary tools that make our services even more reliable and easier to use.
Rackspace Fabric was built over the course of our two decades of experience in the cloud business. We leverage automation to reduce the amount of manual labor associated with serving our customers, as well as to improve efficiency. Whenever there is repetitive, manual labor associated with customer-related tasks, we automate the task. We also use advanced machine learning tools to identify additional work that can be automated. This has provided Rackspace Technology with a critical mass of automation, based upon institutional knowledge and know-how, that we continue to grow incrementally every year.
This is in direct contrast to our competition, many of whom charge for their services on a markup over labor costs, and therefore are not incentivized to employ automation in order to reduce customer costs. 
Approximately 75% of our workloads are automated today, an industry leading figure that increased dramatically in recent years. We continually strive to optimize our automation to drive further efficiency gains in our business.
Rackspace Fabric includes automation that ranges from service delivery to self-healing infrastructure, giving us the ability to anticipate and proactively respond to opportunities and threats. It ensures consistency in our customers’ experiences and allows our Rackers to automate key service and application management processes, freeing up resources to focus on strategic, high-value business opportunities. This drives an efficient business model that has generated revenue per employee of over $450,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, which we believe is ahead of our competitors and in-line with leading SaaS companies. 
Our go-to-market and service-delivery strategy.
Our business benefits from a highly efficient go-to-market strategy. Our sales efforts are led primarily by a team of over 900 quota-bearing representatives and customer success managers. Our ecosystem of partners serves as an extension of our direct sales force, providing a source of additional new business opportunities. Our customer engagement model begins with our professional services, where we partner with a customer to assess its objectives and design the best cloud strategy to meet its needs, and continues with our flexible recurring service offerings. 
We deliver our services to a global customer base through an integrated service delivery model. We have a presence in more than 60 cities around the world. This footprint allows us to better serve customers based in various countries, especially multinational companies requiring cross-border solutions.

Our History
Rackspace Technology’s predecessor company was founded in 1998, and was focused primarily on providing outsourced, dedicated IT infrastructure, primarily for small and mid-sized businesses. The predecessor company was publicly traded from its initial public offering in August 2008 until it was taken private in a leveraged buyout in November 2016. Rackspace Technology subsequently returned to the public markets through an initial public offering in August 2020.
During the time that Rackspace Technology was a private company from 2016 to 2020, management focused on transforming the business to serve companies that were migrating to the cloud. This included forging and strengthening partnerships with the major infrastructure providers such as AWS, Google, Microsoft and VMware; enhancing the company’s service offerings, including professional services, managed security and data services; building an enterprise sales force and professional services-driven sales approach to penetrate a broader market opportunity; and expanding the company’s geographic presence.
Today, we are a trusted partner to the global cloud ecosystem. We maintain close relationships with major cloud infrastructure and application vendors, enabling us to provide our customers with complete, unbiased multicloud services, all through our single customer interface. 
Our Integrated Services Portfolio
We serve our customers through an integrated services portfolio organized in two segments—Multicloud Services and Apps & Cross Platform Services. The services across these two segments are described in more detail below:
•Multicloud Services: Our Multicloud Services segment includes our public and private cloud managed services offerings, as well as professional services related to designing and building multicloud solutions and cloud-native applications. We offer an integrated suite of managed services offerings across our private cloud, the leading public clouds and colocation. Our managed cloud services help customers determine, manage and optimize the right infrastructure, platforms and services on which to deploy their applications to achieve the best performance, agility, security and cost efficiency. We also help customers establish governance, operational and architectural frameworks to mitigate risks and reduce inefficiencies, so they can manage costs, achieve industry-specific compliance objectives and improve security.
Within our Multicloud Services segment, we offer the following services:
•Private cloud: These service offerings provide compute, storage and applications accessed by a specific customer, either with a cloud management layer (in managed private cloud) or without one (in managed hosting). We offer managed private clouds powered by leading technologies like VMware, Microsoft and OpenStack in our data centers as well as in those owned by customers or by third parties such as colocation providers. We also offer managed VMware on AWS, delivering an increasingly popular hybrid combination. Our private cloud offerings can be used with or without virtualization software. 
- 10 -


•Managed public cloud: These offerings address the challenges of managing applications and data on the AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud public clouds. We bundle the underlying public cloud infrastructure with our expertise and experience, managed services and proprietary tools. While the infrastructure providers are responsible for their data centers, servers, storage, networking and operating system software, we help customers navigate, migrate, architect and deploy their applications on those leading public cloud platforms. After a migration, we manage, secure and optimize the customer’s environments on an ongoing basis using our tools, automation and expertise, while supporting the customer with robust service level agreements. These offerings do not require us to commit significant capital expenditures given that third parties provide the infrastructure.
•Managed hosting and colocation: For customers that require infrastructure on mature cloud platforms, we also offer them the option to place their own servers and networking hardware in our data centers (colocation) or to utilize dedicated servers provided by us in our data centers (managed hosting). However, demand for these services has lessened in recent years as more and more customers move their data and applications to the cloud. In some cases, we are proactively approaching customers and encouraging them to move from these mature services to the cloud in order to preserve the customer relationship.
•Apps & Cross Platform: Our Apps & Cross Platform segment includes managed applications, managed security and data services, as well as professional services related to designing and implementing application, security and data services.
•Managed applications: Our managed application services include running large-scale SaaS applications for customers on our and public cloud infrastructure, such as Oracle, SAP and Office 365. This includes key functions such as: managing a customer’s applications and performing key functions such as account management and scaling up or down of required cloud resources. Additionally, we manage productivity and collaboration applications such as email and hosted Microsoft SharePoint.
•Managed security: We provide fully-integrated security solutions that combine cutting-edge technology with our in-house Security Operations Center to provide customers with threat detection, analysis and remediation capabilities. Additionally, we have integrated security platforms into our management tools to give our customers one view of their organization’s vulnerability and threats.
We offer additional managed security services to customers in the areas of (i) security threat assessment and prevention, (ii) proactive threat detection and response, (iii) rapid remediation, (iv) governance, risk and compliance assistance across multiple cloud platforms and (v) Privacy and Data Protection services, including detailed access restrictions and reporting. Our 24x7x365 Customer Security Operations Center is staffed by experienced Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) security analysts.
•Data services: We help customers use their data to further innovate by providing services and expertise for data extraction, transformation, ingestion, storage and analysis. We utilize both traditional analytics platforms and new, machine learning technologies to build repeatable, scalable and automated platforms that extract meaningful insights. Our developers, administrators and cloud and data analytics architects are skilled across a full range of database services, including managed relational databases (Oracle, SAP, SQL Server and MySQL), big data (Hadoop), managed NoSQL (MongoDB) and managed SAP HANA. Our data services are offered both through our managed services subscriptions and through our professional services offerings.
We offer professional services across our entire portfolio, including multicloud solutions, applications, security and data. As part of our professional services process, we meet customers at every stage of their cloud journey and design solutions focused on modernizing their infrastructure and applications to enhance the value of their cloud technologies. This process often serves as the starting point for new business opportunities; following our initial professional services engagement, a customer will typically use any combination of our managed services under long-term contracts, and will often use our professional services multiple times as their technology needs continue to evolve. For some new customer relationships, the early stages of the relationship can be weighted toward infrastructure revenue; in these cases, our customer success sales team is tasked with up-selling and cross-selling additional services, including professional services, to enhance the overall customer relationship.

In addition to our integrated services portfolio described above, we also offer customers our OpenStack Public Cloud solution, our third reporting segment, which represents our legacy business prior to our pivot to multicloud. While we expect to continue to offer our OpenStack Public Cloud solution, we ceased to actively market it to customers in 2017.
Effective on January 1, 2023, Rackspace Technology reorganized around a two-business unit operating model, Public Cloud and Private Cloud. Public Cloud and Private Cloud have very different business dynamics and require different skill sets and levels of investment to manage. This two-business unit operating model ensures increased focus, delivery and service quality for our customers. Beginning in 2023, Rackspace Technology will change its segment reporting to reflect this reorganization under three reporting segments: Public Cloud, Private Cloud and OpenStack Public Cloud.
Our Technology Platform
Our technology platform is at the center of the Fanatical Experience that we deliver to customers. Our technologies focus on removing the complexities of multicloud deployments, unifying compelling aspects of the experience for our customers and enabling us to deliver scalable solutions.
•Innovative automation drives efficiency for us and our customers, enabling us to rapidly and consistently deliver our solutions across multiple products and clouds at scale. Rackspace Business Automation is a custom platform developed to handle over 12 million events and over 1 billion actions per month across physical devices, virtual devices, systems and tools. Data center automation provides services and applications to automate provisioning, configuring and the decommissioning of data center infrastructure. UIPath Robotic Process Automation is deployed across our business to automate repetitive tasks. We can automate 75% of customer support workloads based upon the automation of thousands of unique processes across our support organization.
•AIOps is a new field of software that combines monitoring, machine learning and automation to enhance IT operations. Our AIOps platform correlates monitoring events across our customers’ physical and virtual devices into a single incident or problem, significantly reducing the time to resolution for complex incidents. We developed a first-of-its-kind multi-tenant AIOps solution that processes millions of compliance-related events each month.
•Predictive operations enables our data scientists to build sophisticated models to provide actionable insights to our business leaders, increasing our agility and ability to identify opportunities that enhance our customer relationships.
•Self-service APIs enable our customers to access data and resources programmatically, extending our automation and service delivery into their native tools and processes. We support integration with our ticketing systems to enable two-way integrated support workflows and billing system integration to enable access to consolidated billing data in multicloud environments. Additionally, our pre-built integration with ServiceNow enables enterprise customers to simplify connectivity between our tools and ServiceNow.
•MyRackspace and other portals and associated mobile apps service over 600,000 active monthly users and support product specific self-service, insights, account management, security management, ticketing and billing. These portals are unified with our custom framework and design language, Pilot and Helix, providing a consistent experience and integrated navigation between our product lines and features. Our custom identity management system authenticates access to our user interfaces and APIs. This includes federation capabilities to integrate with our customers’ identity providers.
•Unified billing enables us to deliver an integrated single invoice for customers across all multicloud deployments. Our systems extract and rerate bills from public cloud hyperscalers and merge data from our products and services to generate a single invoice each month, while applying sophisticated billing and discount models.
•Service management applications ensure scale, speed, quality and consistency in our service delivery. These applications, including our custom CORE and Encore tools, support configurable rules and routing engines, integrated escalation management, detailed queue management and management visibility and reporting. These tools are augmented with sophisticated workforce management solutions to manage work shifts by utilizing historical data and trends across ticketing, chat and telephony, to maintain and appropriately staff our 24x7x365 operations.

Our Growth Strategies
In order to continue to drive growth and capture our large market opportunity, key elements of our growth strategies include: 
•growing our private cloud business with new solutions, such as Rackspace Services for VMware Cloud and Rackspace Data Freedom;
•building innovative solutions to broaden our portfolio, including scaled cloud-native solutions on our public cloud platforms and full-stack cloud offerings for infrastructure, applications and data;
•accelerating sales motions to defend our commercial business, expanding into mid-market and selectively targeting enterprise customers with our differentiated solutions both horizontally and vertically;
•identifying new areas with unmet needs and making smart technology bets to capture those opportunities ahead of the trend. For example, new product offerings such as Rackspace Data Freedom and Managed Kubernetes introduced to claim previously-unfilled white space in the cloud market;
•igniting the Racker Culture of innovation and Fanatical Experience for our customers and building on our unique culture by living our core values, embracing a growth mindset and operating with speed while celebrating accomplishments; and
•expanding automation to drive operational effectiveness and continuous process improvement for ourselves and our customers while remaining ahead of the competition in automation and building on our advantage.
Our Competition
We believe our technology and services expertise positions us well to compete with other technology and services providers. We face competition primarily from: 
•In-house IT departments of our customers and potential customers provide services for their respective organizations, but typically need help scaling large technology environments and maximizing the value from their cloud investments, especially when speed, cost and innovation are key constraints. 
•Traditional global IT systems integrators, such as Accenture, Atos, Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, DXC Technology and IBM, offer consulting and outsourcing, in a labor-intensive model, for large enterprise customers. Many of these businesses largely support legacy technologies and, where cloud capabilities exist, legacy revenue streams disincentivize these companies from fully embracing cloud technologies. 
•Cloud service providers and digital systems integrators provide either consultation and implementation services for digital workflows or cloud services for a single cloud vendor. The solutions offered by these companies are often narrow in scope and are not well-suited for companies with complex multicloud objectives. 
•Regional managed services providers use a local go-to-market approach, and provide cloud services within a single region or few regions. These companies are unable to serve the full needs of multinational customers. 
•Colocation providers, such as Equinix, CyrusOne and QTS, provide secure environments for hardware and access to network connectivity. We believe that these companies provide limited services differentiation, and their customers do not benefit from the economics of cloud-based technologies.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include, but are not limited to: 
•Focus on the cloud 
•Technology and services expertise
•Customer experience
•Speed of innovation
•Strength of relationships with technology partners 
•Automation and scalability 
- 13 -


•Standardized operational processes 
•Geographic reach 
•Brand recognition and reputation 
•Price 
We believe that we compare favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. However, many of our competitors have: substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources; relationships with large vendor partners; larger global presence; larger customer bases; longer operating histories; greater brand recognition; and more established relationships in the industry than we do. Furthermore, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships or strategic relationships.
Our Customers
We serve a wide range of customers across geography, size and industry.
•Geography. We serve a global customer base. As of December 31, 2022, we served over 100,000 customers in over 120 countries.
•Size. We have a strong presence with customers of all sizes, including enterprise businesses (revenue in excess of $3 billion), mid-market businesses (revenue of $300 million to $3 billion) and commercial customers (revenue less than $300 million).
•Industry. We serve customers across all sectors, including highly regulated industries with complex security, compliance and governance requirements.
We have low customer concentration; no customer represented 3% or more of our total revenue in 2022.
Representative customers by industry vertical are listed below:

Financial Services | Healthcare | Media & Technology | Retail, Consumer & Leisure
Aon | Apria Healthcare | BT | Nike 
Everest Insurance | Medecision | Braze | VW/Porsche 
TD Bank | Teva Pharmaceuticals | Intrado | Walmart 
BFC Group Holdings | Arthrex | Flextech | Awaze 

Our Approach to Partnerships
We benefit from differentiated partnerships with all major public and private cloud vendors, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and VMware. These partnerships provide us with a competitive advantage unmatched by our competitors, spanning across multiple disciplines, including:
•Comprehensive alignment: We work with major technology partners through a systematic engagement model across six key areas of our business: executive, alliances, solutions, marketing, sales, and service delivery to ensure alignment on key initiatives. We operate strategic programs that include solutions milestones, performance reviews and long-term strategic initiatives. 
•New business opportunities: Our sales teams and pre-sales engineering experts work with sales teams at technology partners to offer bundled solutions through a combined go-to-market effort. This results in a more compelling value proposition and greater value for our mutual customer. We believe our partners view us as a top services partner for their cloud technologies, as we are often cited as a ‘go-to’ services vendor for new business opportunities. 
- 14 -


•Innovative solutions: We work closely with our partners’ product engineering teams as the baseline for our roadmap development and to provide input into our partners’ development plan. This critical input allows us and our partners to develop complementary services and technology. This has helped us arrive and stay at the forefront of innovation well before our competitors, and develop services and tools related to emerging technologies such as cloud-native application development, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). 
We believe these relationships are beneficial to us, our partners and our customers. We and our partners both receive critical inputs for further innovation and benefit from joint go-to-market initiatives, while our customers are able to maximize their use of innovative technologies more efficiently, reduce time-to-market and remain competitive.
Sales and Delivery
Our services are sold via a global direct sales team of over 360 sales representatives and over 560 service delivery managers as of December 31, 2022, through third-party channel partners and through online orders on our website. Our sales model is based on both distributed and centralized sales teams with leads generated from customer referrals, channel partners and corporate marketing efforts. 
Professional services are at the core of our consultative sales model and often serve as the gateway to our platform. For new business opportunities, our professional services organization engages closely with a customer to assess and design the best cloud solution for that customer. This is often the first step toward a long-term services agreement with a customer where we manage a customer’s cloud operations and give them the flexibility to evolve their spend with us as their needs change over time. 
Our network of channel and technology partners also plays an important role in our sales efforts. Our channel partners - including management and technical consultancies, technology integrators, software application providers, value-added resellers and web developers - serve as a source of new business opportunities, primarily for small and medium-sized customers. Our technology partners serve as an extension of our sales force, often leading to new business opportunities as their customers recognize the need for a services partner to make the best use of their technology investments. In some cases, we collaborate directly with these partners on go-to-market efforts. 
Our Customer Success team includes over 560 Rackers and engages in client relationship, contract management, managing deliverables, client retention and growth of our install base. This team is responsible for understanding the existing customers’ changing business needs and translating them into IT requirements, resulting in successful project execution or alignment of our other service offerings. 
Our Culture
At the heart of Fanatical Experience is our unique culture. We invest in the recruitment, development and retention of our Rackers. Inclusion and diversity are top priorities for our company; we attract and cultivate top talent from around the world with diverse backgrounds and a range of expertise. We are highly selective. In our quest to hire the best talent, less than 2% of all applicants are offered positions. We strive to ensure our employees are not just technical experts, but also obsessed with customer outcomes and delivering Fanatical Experience. 
We offer Rackers various professional development opportunities through Rackspace University, along with award-winning onboarding and leadership development programs, enabling them to enhance their capabilities across technologies and further their professional growth.
