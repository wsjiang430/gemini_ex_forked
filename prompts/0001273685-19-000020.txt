General
We are a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the business of acquiring, investing in, financing and managing mortgage-related and residential housing-related assets. Our objective is to deliver long-term stable distributions to our stockholders over changing economic conditions through a combination of net interest margin and net realized capital gains from a diversified investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio includes credit sensitive assets and investments sourced from distressed markets that create the potential for capital gains, as well as more traditional types of mortgage-related investments that generate interest income.

Our investment portfolio includes (i) structured multi-family property investments such as multi-family CMBS and preferred equity in, and mezzanine loans to, owners of multi-family properties, (ii) residential mortgage loans, including distressed residential mortgage loans, non-QM loans, second mortgages, and other residential mortgage loans, (iii) non-Agency RMBS, (iv) Agency RMBS and (v) certain other mortgage-related and residential housing-related assets. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and the maintenance of our exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), we also may opportunistically acquire and manage various other types of mortgage-related and residential housing-related assets that we believe will compensate us appropriately for the risks associated with them, including, without limitation, collateralized mortgage obligations, excess mortgage servicing spreads and securities issued by newly originated residential securitizations, including credit sensitive securities from these securitizations. 
In connection with our growth in recent years, we have taken steps each year since 2016 to internalize the investment management of our various investment portfolios. In May 2016, we acquired our external manager for our structured multi-family property investments. During the first half of 2018, we exited our externally-managed Agency IO strategy and in August 2018, we began the process to internalize the management of our distressed residential loan strategy in order to expand our capabilities in self managing, sourcing and creating single-family residential credit assets. Accordingly, we have added 14 investment professionals to our single-family residential credit investment team and have provided Headlands Asset Management, LLC (“Headlands”), the external manager of our distressed residential loan strategy, notice that we intend to cause our management agreement with them to expire when its term ends in June 2019. We believe that internalization of all our credit investing functions, including both multi-family and single-family residential credit investments, will strengthen our ability to identify and secure future investment opportunities in this key strategic area for our company.
We seek to achieve a balanced and diverse funding mix to finance our assets and operations. We currently rely primarily on a combination of short-term borrowings, such as repurchase agreements with terms typically of 30 days, longer-term repurchase agreement borrowings with terms between one year and 24 months and longer-term financings, such as securitizations and convertible notes, with terms longer than one year.
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and have complied, and intend to continue to comply, with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), with respect thereto. Accordingly, we do not expect to be subject to federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders if certain asset, income, distribution and ownership tests and record keeping requirements are fulfilled. Even if we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we expect to be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income generated in our TRSs.

The financial information requirements required under this Item 1 may be found in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Investment Strategy
Our strategy is to construct a portfolio of mortgage-related and residential housing-related assets that include elements of credit risk and interest rate risk. We have sought in recent years, and intend in the future to continue, to focus on expanding our portfolio of “credit sensitive” assets, which we believe will benefit from improving credit metrics. We define “credit sensitive” assets as (i) structured multi-family property investments, (ii) residential mortgage loans, including distressed residential mortgage loans, non-QM loans, second mortgages and other residential mortgage loans, (iii) non-Agency RMBS and (iv) other mortgage-related and residential housing-related assets that contain credit risk. In pursuing credit sensitive assets, we target assets that we believe will provide an attractive total rate of return, as compared to assets that strictly provide net interest margin. We also own and manage a highly-leveraged portfolio of Agency RMBS, primarily comprised of Agency fixed-rate RMBS and Agency ARMs, and we may pursue opportunistic acquisitions of other types of assets that meet our investment criteria. 
Prior to deploying capital to any of the assets we target or determining to dispose of any of our investments, our management team will consider, among other things, the availability of suitable investments, the amount and nature of anticipated cash flows from the asset, our ability to finance or borrow against the asset and the terms of such financing, the related capital requirements, the credit risk related to the asset or the underlying collateral, the composition of our investment portfolio, REIT qualification, the maintenance of our exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act and other regulatory requirements and future general market and economic conditions. In periods where we have working capital in excess of our short-term liquidity needs, we may invest the excess in more liquid assets until such time as we are able to re-invest that capital in assets that meet our underwriting requirements. Consistent with our strategy to produce returns through a combination of net interest margin and net realized capital gains, we will seek, from time to time, to sell certain assets within our portfolio when we believe the combination of realized gains on an asset and reinvestment potential for the related sale proceeds are consistent with our long-term return objectives.
Our investment strategy does not, subject to our continued compliance with applicable REIT tax requirements and the maintenance of our exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, limit the amount of our capital that may be invested in any of these investments or in any particular class or type of assets. Thus, our future investments may include asset types different from the targeted or other assets described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our investment and capital allocation decisions depend on prevailing market conditions, among other factors, and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different economic and capital market environments. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage of our capital that will be invested in any particular investment at any given time.
For more information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2018, see Item 7 - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” below.
Investments in Credit Sensitive Assets
Our portfolio of credit sensitive assets is currently comprised of investments in two asset categories: structured multi-family property investments and single-family residential credit investments. 
Structured Multi-Family Property Investments 
We seek to position our structured multi-family investment platform in the marketplace as a real estate investor focused on debt and equity transactions. We do not seek to be the sole owner or day-to-day manager of properties. Rather, we intend to participate at various levels within the capital structure of the properties, typically (i) as a “capital partner” by lending to or co-investing alongside a project-level sponsor that has already identified an attractive investment opportunity, or (ii) through a subordinated security of a multi-family loan securitization. Our multi-family property investments are not limited to any particular geographic area in the United States. In general terms, we expect that our multi-family investments will principally be in the form of multi-family CMBS, as well as preferred equity investments in, and mezzanine loans to, owners of multi-family apartment properties. 
With respect to our preferred equity and mezzanine loan investments where we participate as a capital partner, we generally pursue multi-family properties with unique or compelling attributes that provide an opportunity for value creation and increased returns through the combination of better management or capital improvements that will lead to net cash flow growth and capital gains. Generally, we target investments in multi-family properties that are or have been:
6


• | located in a particularly dynamic submarket with strong prospects for rental growth;


• | located in smaller markets that are underserved and more attractively priced;


• | poorly managed by the previous owner, creating an opportunity for overall net income growth through better management practices;


• | undercapitalized and may benefit from an investment in physical improvements; or


• | highly stable and are suitably positioned to support high-yield preferred equity or mezzanine debt within their capital structure.

As a capital partner, we generally seek experienced property-level operators or real estate entrepreneurs who have the ability to identify and manage strong investment opportunities. We require our operating partners to maintain a material investment in every multi-family property in which we make a preferred equity investment or provide mezzanine financing.
Multi-Family CMBS. Our portfolio of multi-family CMBS is comprised of (i) first loss POs issued by certain multi-family loan K-series securitizations sponsored by Freddie Mac and (ii) certain IOs and mezzanine securities issued by these securitizations. Our investments in these privately placed first loss POs generally represent 7.5% of the overall securitization which typically initially totals approximately $1.0 billion in multi-family loans consisting of 45 to 100 individual properties diversified across a wide geographic footprint in the United States. Our first loss POs are typically backed by fixed rate balloon non-recourse mortgage loans that provide for the payment of principal at maturity date, which is ten to fifteen years from the date the underlying mortgage loans are originated. Moreover, each first loss PO of multi-family CMBS in our portfolio is the most junior of securities issued by the securitization, meaning it will absorb all losses in the securitization prior to other more senior securities being exposed to loss. As a result, each of the first loss POs in our portfolio has been purchased, upon completion of a credit analysis and due diligence, at a sizable discount to its then-current par value, which we believe provides us with adequate protection against projected losses. In addition, as the owner of the first loss PO, the Company has the right to participate in the workout of any distressed property in the securitization. We believe this right provides the Company with an opportunity to mitigate or reduce any possible loss associated with the distressed property. The IOs that we own represent a strip off the entire securitization allowing the Company to receive cash flows over the life of the multi-family loans backing the securitization. These investments range from 10 to 17.5 basis points and the underlying notional amount approximates $1.0 billion each. We also invest in mezzanine securities of multi-family CMBS, the investment in which may involve our use of some form of leverage in order to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns on these securities. With respect to the multi-family CMBS owned by us, all of the loans that back the respective securitizations have been generally underwritten in accordance with Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines and standards; however, the multi-family CMBS we own are not guaranteed by Freddie Mac.
Preferred Equity. We currently own, and expect to originate in the future, preferred equity investments in entities that directly or indirectly own multi-family properties. Preferred equity is not secured, but holders have priority relative to the common equity on cash flow distributions and proceeds from capital events. In addition, as a preferred holder we may seek to enhance our position and protect our equity position with covenants that limit the entity’s activities and grant to the preferred holders the right to control the property upon default under relevant loan agreements or under the terms of our preferred equity investments. Occasionally, the first-mortgage loan on a property prohibits additional liens and a preferred equity structure provides an attractive financing alternative. With preferred equity investments, we may become a special limited partner or member in the ownership entity and may be entitled to take certain actions, or cause a liquidation, upon a default. Under the typical arrangement, the preferred equity investor receives a stated return, and the common equity investor receives all cash flow only after that return has been met. Preferred equity typically has loan-to-value ratios of 70% to 90% when combined with the first-mortgage loan amount. We expect our preferred equity investments will have mandatory redemption dates that will generally be coterminous with the maturity date for the first-mortgage loan on the property, and we expect to hold these investments until the mandatory redemption date. 
Mezzanine Loans. We currently own, and anticipate making in the future, mezzanine loans that are senior to the operating partner’s equity in, and subordinate to a first-mortgage loan on, a multi-family property. These loans are secured by pledges of ownership interests, in whole or in part, in entities that directly or indirectly own the real property. In addition, we may require other collateral to secure mezzanine loans, including letters of credit, personal guarantees or collateral unrelated to the property.
We may structure our mezzanine loans so that we receive a fixed or variable interest rate on the loan. Our mezzanine loans may also have prepayment lockouts, prepayment penalties, minimum profit hurdles or other mechanisms to protect and enhance returns in the event of premature repayment. We expect these investments will typically have terms from three to ten years. Mezzanine loans typically have loan-to-value ratios between 70% and 90% when combined with the first-mortgage loan amount. 
7

 Joint Venture Equity. We own two joint venture investments in entities that own multi-family properties. Joint venture equity is a direct common equity ownership interest in an entity that owns a property. In this type of investment, the return of capital to us is variable and is made on a pari passu basis between us and the other operating partners. In most cases, we have provided between 77% and 90% of the total equity capital for the joint venture, with our operating partner providing the balance of the equity capital. 
Other. We may also acquire investments that are structured with terms that reflect a combination of the investment structures described above. We also may invest, from time to time, based on market conditions, in other multi-family investments, structured investments in other property categories, equity and debt securities issued by entities that invest in residential and commercial real estate or in other mortgage-related assets that enable us to qualify or maintain our qualification as a REIT or otherwise.
Single-Family Residential Credit Investments
We first began acquiring residential mortgage loans in 2010 from select mortgage loan originators and secondary market institutions. We generally seek to acquire pools of single-family residential mortgage loans from select mortgage loan originators and secondary market institutions and contract with originators to acquire residential mortgage loans they newly originate that meet our purchase criteria. We do not directly service the mortgage loans we acquire, and instead contract with fully licensed third-party subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions. 
Distressed Residential Mortgage Loans. The distressed residential mortgage loans consist of seasoned re-performing, non-performing and other delinquent mortgage loans secured by first liens on one- to four-family properties. The loans were purchased at a discount to the aggregate principal amount outstanding, which we believe provides us with downside protection while we work to rehabilitate these loans to performing status. 

Performing Residential Mortgage Loans. The performing residential mortgage loans consist of GSE eligible mortgage loans, non-QM mortgage loans that predominantly meet our underwriting guidelines, loans originally underwritten to GSE or another program's guidelines, but are either undeliverable to the GSE or ineligible for a program due to certain underwriting or compliance errors, and investor loans generally underwritten to our program guidelines.
Second Mortgages. During the third quarter of 2015, we announced the expansion of our credit residential strategy through investments in targeted newly originated second mortgages. We purchase second mortgages that have equity in excess of the balance on the combined first and second lien mortgage owed and predominantly meet our underwriting guidelines. We believe this program provides us with attractive risk-adjusted returns by targeting higher credit-quality borrowers that we believe are currently underserved by large financial institutions. 

Investments in Non-Agency RMBS. Our non-Agency RMBS are collateralized by residential credit assets. The non-Agency RMBS in our investment portfolio may consist of the senior, mezzanine or subordinate tranches in the securitizations. The underlying collateral of these securitizations are predominantly residential credit assets, which may be exposed to various macroeconomic and asset-specific credit risks. These securities have varying levels of credit enhancement which provides some structural protection from losses within the portfolio. We undertake an in-depth assessment of the underlying collateral and securitization structure when investing in these assets, which may include modeling defaults, prepayments and loss across different scenarios. We believe that non-Agency RMBS provide attractive returns given our assessment of the interest rate and credit risk associated with these securities.
Leveraged Agency RMBS Investments
Our Agency fixed-rate RMBS portfolio consists of pass-through certificates, the principal and interest of which are guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, which are primarily backed by 15-year and 30-year residential fixed-rate mortgage loans. 
Our Agency ARMs consist of pass-through certificates, the principal and interest of which are guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, and are backed by ARMs or hybrid ARMs. Our current portfolio of Agency ARMs has interest reset periods ranging from 1 month to 44 months.
8

Our Financing Strategy
We strive to maintain and achieve a balanced and diverse funding mix to finance our assets and operations. To achieve this, we rely primarily on a combination of short-term and longer-term repurchase agreement borrowings and structured financings, including securitized debt, CDOs, long-term subordinated debt, and convertible notes. The Company's policy for leverage is based on the type of asset, underlying collateral and overall market conditions, with the intent of obtaining more permanent, longer -term financing for our more illiquid assets. Based on our current portfolio composition, our overall target leverage ratio is approximately 2.4 to 1. This target may be adjusted depending on the composition of our overall portfolio.
As of December 31, 2018, our overall leverage ratio, which represents our total debt divided by our total stockholders' equity, was approximately 2.0 to 1. Our overall leverage ratio does not include the mortgage debt of The Clusters or debt associated with the Multi-family CDOs or the Residential CDOs and other non-recourse debt, for which we have no obligation. Our leverage ratio on our short-term financings or callable debt, which represents our repurchase agreement borrowings divided by our total stockholders' equity, was approximately 1.8 to 1 as of December 31, 2018. We monitor all at risk or short-term borrowings to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to satisfy margin calls and liquidity covenant requirements.
We primarily rely on repurchase agreements to fund the securities we own. These repurchase agreements provide us with borrowings, which have terms ranging from 30 days to 24 months, that bear interest rates that are linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), a short-term market interest rate used to determine short-term loan rates. Pursuant to these repurchase agreements, the financial institution that serves as a counterparty will generally agree to provide us with financing based on the market value of the assets that we pledge as collateral, less a “haircut.” The market value of the collateral represents the price of such collateral obtained from generally recognized sources or most recent closing bid quotation from such source plus accrued income. Our repurchase agreements may require us to deposit additional collateral pursuant to a margin call if the market value of our pledged collateral declines as a result of market conditions or due to principal repayments on the mortgages underlying our pledged securities. Interest rates and haircuts will depend on the underlying collateral pledged.
With respect to our investments in credit assets that are not financed by short-term repurchase agreements, we finance our investment in these assets through long-term borrowings and working capital. Our financings may include longer-term structured debt financing, such as longer-term repurchase agreement financing and securitized debt where the assets we intend to finance are contributed to an SPE and serve as collateral for the financing.  We engage in longer-term financings for the primary purpose of obtaining longer-term non-recourse financing on these assets. 

Pursuant to the terms of our long-term debt financings, our ability to access the cash flows generated by the assets serving as collateral for these borrowings may be significantly limited and we may be unable to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of or modify such assets until the financing has matured. As part of each of our securitized debt financings and longer-term master repurchase agreements that finance certain of our credit assets, we have provided a guarantee with respect to certain terms of some of these longer-term borrowings incurred by certain of our subsidiaries and we may provide similar guarantees in connection with future financings.
For more information regarding our outstanding borrowings and debt instruments at December 31, 2018, see Item 7 - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” below.
Our Hedging Strategy

 The Company enters into derivative instruments in connection with its risk management activities. These derivative instruments may include interest rate swaps, swaptions, interest rate caps, futures, options on futures and mortgage derivatives such as forward-settling purchases and sales of Agency RMBS where the underlying pools of mortgage loans are “To-Be-Announced,” or TBAs.
We use interest rate swaps to hedge any variable cash flows associated with our borrowings. We typically pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate based on one or three month LIBOR, on the notional amount of the interest rate swaps. The floating rate we receive under our swap agreements has the effect of offsetting the repricing characteristics and cash flows of our financing arrangements. 
9

We may use TBAs, swaptions, futures and options on futures to hedge market value risk for certain of our strategies. We have utilized TBAs as part of our Agency investment strategy to enhance the overall yield of the portfolio. In a TBA transaction, we would agree to purchase or sell, for future delivery, Agency RMBS with certain principal and interest terms and certain types of underlying collateral, but the particular Agency RMBS to be delivered is not identified until shortly before the TBA settlement date. The Company typically does not take delivery of TBAs, but rather settles with its trading counterparties on a net basis prior to the forward settlement date. Although TBAs are liquid and have quoted market prices and represent the most actively traded class of RMBS, the use of TBAs exposes us to increased market value risk.
In connection with our hedging strategy, we utilize a model based risk analysis system to assist in projecting portfolio performances over a variety of different interest rates and market scenarios, such as shifts in interest rates, changes in prepayments and other factors impacting the valuations of our assets and liabilities. However, given the uncertainties related to prepayment rates, it is not possible to perfectly lock-in a spread between the earnings asset yield and the related cost of borrowings. Nonetheless, through active management and the use of evaluative stress scenarios, we believe that we can mitigate a significant amount of both value and earnings volatility.

Competition
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. When we invest in mortgage-backed securities, mortgage loans and other investment assets, we compete with other REITs, investment banking firms, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds, banks and other financial institutions and other entities that invest in the same types of assets.
