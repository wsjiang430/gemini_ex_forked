ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview and History
BG Staffing, Inc. (“BG Staffing,” “we,” or the “Company”) is a leading national provider of temporary staffing services that operates, along with its wholly owned subsidiaries, within the U.S. in three industry segments: Real Estate, Professional, and Light Industrial. We provide field talent to a variety of client partners that are seeking to match their workforce requirements to their business needs. Our client partners operate across a diverse set of industries.
We employ a diverse operating model, both from a skill set and a geographic standpoint, which we believe mitigates downside revenue risk. 
Our temporary staffing services consist of on-demand or short-term staffing assignments, contract staffing, and on-site management administration. Short-term staffing services assist employers in dealing with employee demands caused by such factors as seasonality, fluctuations in client partner demand, vacations, illnesses, parental leave, and special projects without incurring the ongoing expense and administrative responsibilities associated with recruiting, hiring and retaining permanent employees. As more and more companies focus on effectively managing variable costs and reducing fixed overhead, the use of short-term staffing services allows companies to utilize a contingent staffing approach for their personnel needs, thereby converting a portion of their fixed personnel costs to a variable expense.
Our contract staffing services place field talent with client partners for time-periods of more than three months or for an indefinite time period. This type of arrangement often involves outsourcing an entire department in a large corporation or providing the workforce for a large project. 
In an on-site management arrangement, we place an experienced manager on-site at a client partner’s place of business. The manager is responsible for conducting all recruiting, employee screening, interviewing, drug testing, hiring and employee placement for field talent at the client partner’s facility for a long-term or indefinite period.
Management believes that the staffing industry and the employees performing these temporary staffing functions are, and will remain, an integral part of the labor market in local, regional and national economies in which we operate.
BG Staffing, Inc. is the successor by conversion to LTN Staffing, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on August 27, 2007. In 2011, we began doing business as BG Staffing. LTN Staffing, LLC converted into a Delaware corporation, BG Staffing, Inc., following the merger of LTN Acquisition, LLC (the former parent of LTN Staffing, LLC) with and into LTN Staffing, LLC. The conversion was completed on November 3, 2013.
We commenced operations on October 17, 2007 and since 2009 new leadership has led an on-going growth and diversification initiative. Since 2010, we have acquired and successfully integrated nine businesses:

• | In June 2010, we purchased the interests of BG Personnel Services, LP and BG Personnel, LP, and purchased the common stock of B G Staff Services, Inc. Shortly after the purchase, we relocated our corporate headquarters to Dallas, Texas.

Our Industry
The temporary staffing industry supplies field talent to client partners to help them minimize the cost and effort of workforce planning. These services also enable the client partner to rapidly respond to changes in business conditions, and in some cases to convert fixed labor costs to variable costs. Temporary staffing companies act as intermediaries in matching available field talent to client partner assignments. The demand for a flexible workforce continues to grow with competitive and economic pressures to reduce costs and respond to changing market conditions.
The temporary staffing market is subject to volatility based on overall economic conditions. Historically, in periods of economic growth, the number of companies providing temporary staffing services has increased due to low barriers to entry. During recessionary periods, the number of companies has decreased through consolidation, bankruptcies, or other events. The temporary staffing industry is experiencing increased demand in relation to total job growth as client partners have placed a greater priority on maintaining a more flexible workforce.
The temporary staffing industry is large and highly fragmented with approximately 20,000 competing companies. In September 2018, Staffing Industry Analysts estimated the 2019 U.S. temporary staffing market will be an estimated $152 billion, which is up from an estimated $145 billion in 2018. Staffing companies compete both to recruit and retain a supply of field talent and to attract and retain client partners to use these workers. Client partner demand for temporary staffing services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and trends toward greater workforce flexibility. The temporary staffing industry includes a number of markets focusing on business needs that vary widely in duration of assignment and level of technical specialization.
Our Operations
We have diversified our operations to provide field talent within distinct segments of the industry. We refer to these segments as Real Estate, Professional, and Light Industrial. 
We operate branches within each segment as separate profit centers and provide managers considerable operational autonomy and financial incentives. Managers focus on business opportunities within their geographical markets and are provided centralized support to achieve success in those markets. We believe this structure allows us to recruit and retain highly motivated managers who have demonstrated the ability to succeed in a competitive environment. This structure also allows managers and staff to focus on market development while relying on centralized services for support in back-office operations, such as risk management programs and unemployment insurance, credit, collections, accounting, advice on legal and regulatory matters, and quality standards.

Our Segments
Our operations are organized into three business segments: Real Estate, Professional, and Light Industrial.
Real Estate Segment
Our Real Estate segment is a leading provider of office and maintenance field talent to various apartment communities and commercial buildings. We currently have 51 branch offices in 24 states. The Real Estate division utilizes a centralized recruiting model from recruiting centers in Dallas, Houston, and Austin, Texas, in the Charlotte, North Carolina area, and the Tampa, Florida area. All open positions nationally are recruited from one of these regional recruiting centers. The workers we assign to our Real Estate client partners are our field talent, although our client partners provide on-the-job direction, control and supervision.
Professional Segment
Our Professional segment provides highly skilled IT professionals with expertise in SAP, Workday, Olik View, Hyperion, Oracle, project management and other IT staffing skills to client partners on a national basis. Our client partners include large Fortune 500 companies and consulting firms engaged in systems integration projects. We operate our national coverage of the IT market from our offices in North Carolina, Rhode Island, Maryland, and Tennessee. Additionally, we provide finance, accounting, legal and related support personnel primarily in Texas and Louisiana through our Texas based D&W group and in the Chicago area through our Smart group.
Light Industrial Segment
Our Light Industrial segment provides field talent to manufacturing, distribution, and logistics client partners needing a flexible workforce. We currently have 13 branch offices and 19 on-site locations operating in 6 states. Our Light Industrial segment field talent perform services in a variety of skilled and unskilled positions.

Financial Information about Geographic Areas

Our Recruiting
We believe a key component of our success is the ability to recruit and maintain a pool of qualified field talent and regularly place them into desirable and appropriate positions. We use comprehensive methods to identify, assess, select and, when appropriate, measure the skills of our field talent and permanent placement candidates to meet the needs of our client partners.
Our Client Partners
We currently service small and medium-sized companies as well as divisions of Fortune 500 companies. As is common in the staffing industry, our engagements to provide temporary services to our client partners are generally of a non-exclusive, short-term nature and subject to termination by the client partner with little or no notice. No client partner accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2018, 2017, or 2016.

Growth Strategy
We are committed to growing our operations. Revenues have grown from $35 million in 2009 to $286.9 million in 2018, by using a growth strategy reliant upon both acquisitions and organic growth.
We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities utilizing our proven approach to the assessment, valuation, and integration of acquisitions. Additionally, we are committed to continue to grow our operations in our current markets, as well as expand into new markets within the segments and industries that we currently serve.
We are organized to handle many of the administrative functions at our corporate location so that our branches can focus on business development and the effective recruiting and assignment of field talent.
We will continue to invest in technology and process improvements, as necessary, to ensure that we are operating at optimal productivity and performance.
Competition
The staffing services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. We compete in national, regional and local markets with full-service and specialized temporary staffing companies. Some of our competitors have significantly more marketing and financial resources than we do. Price competition in the staffing industry is intense. We expect that the level of competition will remain high, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.
The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified candidates for temporary assignments are pay rates, availability of assignments, duration of assignments and responsiveness to requests for placement. We believe that many potential candidates seeking temporary assignments through us may also be pursuing assignments through other means. Therefore, the speed at which we place prospective field talent and the availability of appropriate assignments are important factors in our ability to complete assignments of qualified field talent. In addition to having high quality field talent to assign in a timely manner, the principal competitive factors in obtaining and retaining client partners in the temporary staffing industry are properly assessing the client partners’ specific job requirements, the appropriateness of the field talent assigned to the client partner, the price of services and the monitoring of client partner satisfaction. Although we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors, we expect competition to continue to increase.
Seasonality
Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations. Our quarterly operating results are affected by the number of billing days in a quarter, as well as the seasonality of our client partners’ business. Demand for our Real Estate staffing services increase in the second and is highest during the third quarter of the year due to the increased turns in multifamily units during the summer months when schools are not in session. Demand for our Light Industrial staffing services increases during the third quarter of the year and peaks in the fourth quarter due to increase in the demand for holiday help. Overall first quarter demand can be affected by adverse weather conditions in the winter months. In addition, our cost of services typically increases in the first quarter primarily due to the reset of payroll taxes.
The staffing industry has historically been cyclical, often acting as an indicator of both economic downturns and upswings. Staffing client partners tend to use temporary staffing to supplement their existing workforces and generally hire direct workers when long-term demand is expected to increase. As a consequence, our revenues tend to increase quickly when the economy begins to grow and, conversely, our revenues can also decrease quickly when the economy begins to weaken.
Team Members and Field Talent

As of February 4, 2019, we had 349 team members (staff employees) at our corporate and branch offices. During the fiscal year ended 2018, we assigned approximately 30,000 field talent and had working, on average, approximately 5,000 field talent during the fourth quarter of 2018.

None of our team members or field talent are represented by a labor union, and we are not aware of any current efforts or plans to organize any of our team members or field talent. To date we have not experienced any material labor disruptions.

Regulation
We are subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets employment practice standards for workers, and similar state and local agencies. We are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions within which we operate. While the specific laws and regulations vary among these jurisdictions, some require some form of licensing and often have statutory requirements for workplace safety and notice of change in obligation of workers’ compensation coverage in the event of contract termination. Although compliance with these requirements imposes some additional financial risk on us, particularly with respect to those client partners who breach their payment obligation to us, such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business to date. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could also materially harm our business.
