Gerdau Acquisition
On November 5, 2018 (the "Acquisition Date"), the Company completed the acquisition of 33 reinforcing bar ("rebar") fabrication facilities in the U.S., which are part of our Americas Fabrication segment, as well as four EAF mini mills located in Knoxville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Sayreville, New Jersey and Rancho Cucamonga, California, which are part of our Americas Mills segment, from Gerdau S.A., hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Acquired Businesses". For further details, refer to Note 3, Acquisition, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
AMERICAS RECYCLING
Our Americas Recycling segment processes scrap metals for use as a raw material by us and other manufacturers of new metal products. This segment operates 34 scrap metal processing facilities, with 14 locations in Texas, five locations in each of Florida and South Carolina, two locations in each of Georgia, Missouri, and North Carolina, and one location in each of Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Tennessee. These locations consist of 651 acres of land owned by the Company and 47 acres of land leased from third-parties.
We purchase ferrous and nonferrous metals, processed and unprocessed, from a variety of sources in a variety of forms. Sources of metal for processing include manufacturing and industrial plants, metal fabrication plants, electric utilities, machine shops, factories, railroads, refineries, shipyards, ordinance depots, demolition businesses, automobile salvage firms, wrecking firms, small scrap metal collection firms and retail individuals.
2

Our scrap metal processing facilities typically consist of an office and warehouse building located on several acres of land that we use for receiving, processing, storing and shipping metals. These facilities utilize specialized equipment for processing both ferrous and nonferrous metal, and three of our facilities have extensive equipment that reclaim metal from scrap insulated wire. Our larger scrap metal processing facilities utilize various equipment, such as scales, shears, baling presses, briquetting machines, conveyors, magnetic separators, presses, and shredders, which enable these facilities to efficiently process large volumes of scrap metals. We use cranes to handle scrap metals for processing and to load material for shipment. We transport processed scrap to customers, including our mills, by rail, truck, export container and barge. 
Americas Recycling operates five large shredding machines, two in Texas and one in each of Florida, Oklahoma, and South Carolina, capable of pulverizing obsolete automobiles or other sources of scrap metal. We have three additional shredders, two operated by our Americas Mills segment and one operated by our International Mill segment. With the exception of precious metals, our U.S. scrap metal processing facilities recycle and process practically all types of metal.
We sell scrap metals to steel mills and foundries, aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers, brass and bronze ingot makers, copper refineries and mills, secondary lead smelters, specialty steel mills, high temperature alloy manufacturers and other consumers. Ferrous metal is the primary raw material for EAFs, such as those operated by our Americas Mills and International Mill segments. Our Irving, Texas office coordinates the sale of substantially all nonferrous metals from our metal processing facilities. 
Our recycling business competes with other scrap metal processors and primary nonferrous metal producers, both in the U.S. and internationally, for sales of nonferrous materials. Consumers of nonferrous metals frequently utilize primary or "virgin" ingot processed by mining companies instead of nonferrous metals. The prices of nonferrous metals are closely related to, but generally less than, the prices of primary or "virgin" ingot.
AMERICAS MILLS
Our Americas Mills segment operates seven EAF mini mills, two EAF micro mills, a rerolling mill, two scrap metal shredders, eight scrap metal processing facilities that directly support the mills, and a railroad salvage operation, all of which are based in the U.S. These locations consist of 2,706 acres of land owned by the Company and 18 acres of land leased from third-parties.
Our seven EAF mini mills, located in Alabama, California, Florida, New Jersey, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas, our two EAF micro mills, located in Arizona and Oklahoma, and our rerolling mill, located in Arkansas, produce one or more of the following: steel rebar, angles, flats, rounds, channels, fence post sections and other shapes. In this segment, we have two metal processing facilities located in each of Alabama and South Carolina and four located in Texas. This segment also operates two shredders, one each in Texas and South Carolina.
Descriptions of mill capacity, particularly rolling capacity, are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured. Our mills roll many different types and sizes of products depending on market conditions, including pricing and demand. Our estimated annual capacity for finished goods of approximately 5.8 million tons assumes a typical product mix and does not represent the quantity of likely production or shipments in each fiscal year.
The following table presents the amount of steel melted, rolled and shipped by our ten steel mills in the Americas Mills segment.

Tons (in thousands) | 2019 | 2018 | | 2017
Melted | 4,357 | | 2,922 | | 2,603
Rolled | 4,134 | | 2,673 | | 2,476
Shipped | 4,394 | | 3,013 | | 2,725

Our seven EAF mini mills each consist of:

• | a melt shop with an electric arc furnace;


• | continuous casting equipment that shapes molten metal into billets;


• | a reheating furnace that prepares billets for rolling;


• | a rolling mill that forms products from heated billets;


• | a mechanical cooling bed that receives hot products from the rolling mill;


• | finishing facilities that cut, straighten, bundle and prepare products for shipping; and


• | supporting facilities such as maintenance, warehouse and office areas.

3

Our two EAF micro mills utilize similar equipment and processes as described above; however, these facilities utilize unique continuous process technology where metal flows uninterrupted from melting to casting to rolling. The facilities are more compact than existing, larger capacity steel mini mills, and production is dedicated to a limited product range. In addition, our two EAF micro mills are the only facilities in the U.S. capable of producing spooled rebar.
Our rerolling mill does not utilize a melt shop. Instead, the process begins by reheating billets or reclaimed rail to roll into finished products.
To minimize the cost of our products, to the extent feasibly consistent with market conditions and working capital demands, we prefer to operate our facilities at or near full capacity. Through operations and capital improvements, we strive to increase productivity, capacity and product mix at our mills. To remain competitive, we regularly make substantial capital expenditures. Over the past three fiscal years, we invested approximately $347.8 million, or 66%, of total capital expenditures in our Americas Mills segment.
Other than our rerolling mill, ferrous scrap is the primary raw material used by our mills. Although ferrous metal has historically been subject to significant price fluctuations, we believe the supply of ferrous metal is adequate to meet our future needs. The mills consume large amounts of electricity and natural gas. We have not had any significant curtailments, and we believe that energy supplies are adequate. The supply and demand of regional and national energy and the extent of applicable regulatory oversight of rates charged by providers affect the prices we pay for electricity and natural gas.
Our mills ship to a broad range of customers and end markets across all regions of the U.S. The primary end markets are construction and fabricating industries, steel service centers, original equipment manufacturers, and agricultural, energy and petrochemical industries. We utilize a fleet of trucks that we own or lease as well as private haulers and railcars to transport our finished products.
Due to the nature of certain stock products we sell in the Americas Mills segment, we do not have a long lead time between order receipt and delivery. We generally fill orders for stock products from inventory or with products near completion. As a result, we do not believe that backlog, defined as the total value of unfulfilled orders, is a significant factor in the evaluation of these operations. Backlog at August 31, 2019 was approximately $370.5 million, compared to $326.4 million at August 31, 2018. 
AMERICAS FABRICATION
Our Americas Fabrication segment consists of our steel fabrication facilities that bend, weld, cut and fabricate steel, primarily rebar, and produce steel fence posts; warehouses that sell or rent products for the installation of concrete; and facilities that heat-treat steel to strengthen and provide flexibility.
Steel Fabrication
Through our Americas Fabrication segment, we operate 67 facilities engaged in the various aspects of steel fabrication. Most of the facilities engage in general fabrication of reinforcing steel, with four facilities fabricating only steel fence posts. We obtain steel for these facilities from our mills and third-party vendors. 
We conduct steel fabrication activities at 12 locations in Texas, seven locations in California, five locations in Florida, four locations in Georgia, three locations in each of Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia, two locations in each of Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Utah, and one location in each of Alabama, Connecticut, Hawaii, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington. These locations consist of 787 acres of land owned by the Company and 66 acres of land leased from third-parties.
Fabricated steel products are used primarily in the construction of commercial and non-commercial buildings, hospitals, convention centers, industrial plants, power plants, highways, bridges, arenas, stadiums and dams. Generally, we sell fabricated steel in response to a competitive bid solicitation from a construction contractor or a project owner. Typically, the contractor or project owner does not negotiate with the bidders individually. We also provide installation services in certain markets. 
Backlog in our steel fabrication operations was approximately $1.1 billion at August 31, 2019, compared to $679.3 million at August 31, 2018. The backlog at August 31, 2019 included $272.3 million related to the Acquired Businesses.

Construction Services 
Our Construction Services business unit sells and rents construction-related products and equipment to concrete installers and other businesses in the construction industry. We have 17 locations in Texas, five in Louisiana and one in Oklahoma where we store, sell and rent these construction-related products, which, with the exception of a small portion of steel products, are purchased from third-party suppliers.
Impact Metals 
We provide heat-treated steel products through CMC Impact Metals, a subsidiary of CMC. CMC Impact Metals is one of North America's premier producers of high strength steel products. We operate facilities in Alabama and Pennsylvania, which manufacture high strength bar for the truck trailer industry, special bar quality steel for the energy market and armor plate for military vehicles. CMC Impact Metals works closely with our Alabama mini mill and other steel mills that sell specialized heat-treated steel for customer specific use.
INTERNATIONAL MILL
Our International Mill segment is comprised of an EAF mini mill, recycling and fabrication operations located in Poland. Our subsidiary, CMC Poland Sp. z.o.o. ("CMCP"), operates the EAF mini mill in Zawiercie, Poland. Our Poland EAF mini mill operates equipment similar to the equipment operated by our U.S. EAF mini mills. This segment's operations are conducted through: two rolling mills that produce primarily rebar and high-quality merchant products; a specialty rod finishing mill; 12 scrap processing facilities, which includes a large capacity scrap metal shredding facility similar to the largest shredder we operate in the U.S.; and four steel fabrication facilities primarily for rebar and wire mesh. These properties consist of 647 acres of land owned by the Company and 6 acres of land leased from third-parties.
Our Poland mini mill operates a flexible rolling mill designed to allow efficient and flexible production of a range of medium section merchant bar products. This rolling mill complements the facility's other rolling mill dedicated primarily to rebar production. Either rolling mill can feed an alternative finishing end designed to produce high grade wire rod. 
Our Poland mini mill is a significant manufacturer of rebar, merchant bar and wire rod in Eastern Europe, selling primarily to fabricators, manufacturers, distributors and construction companies. The majority of sales are to customers within Poland. However, the Poland mini mill also exports to the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and other countries. Ferrous metal, the principal raw material used by our Poland mini mill, electricity, natural gas and other necessary raw materials for the steel manufacturing process are generally readily available, although they can be subject to significant price fluctuations.
Our fabrication operations in Poland have expanded downstream captive uses for a portion of the rebar and wire rod manufactured at the Poland mini mill. We conduct rebar fabrication activities in Zawiercie, Żyrardów and Rzeszów, Poland. These three rebar fabrication facilities are similar to those operated by our U.S. fabrication facilities and sell fabricated rebar primarily to contractors for incorporation into construction projects. In addition to fabricated rebar, these facilities sell fabricated mesh, assembled rebar cages and other value added rebar products.
Additionally, we operate a fabrication facility in Dąbrowa Górnicza, Poland that produces welded steel mesh, cold rolled wire rod and cold rolled rebar. This operation supplements sales of fabricated rebar by offering wire mesh to customers, which include metals service centers and construction contractors. We maintain a presence in the Polish fabrication market, but we also export to neighboring countries such as the Czech Republic, Germany and Slovakia.
Our Poland mini mill generally fills orders for stock products from inventory or with products near completion. As a result, we do not believe that backlog levels are a significant factor in the evaluation of this operation. Backlog in our Poland fabrication operations was approximately $33.9 million at August 31, 2019 compared to $53.5 million at August 31, 2018. 
SEASONALITY
Many of our mills and fabrication facilities serve customers in the construction industry. Due to the increase in construction during the spring and summer months, our net sales are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year than in the first and second quarters.
COMPETITION
The nonferrous recycling industry is fragmented in the U.S. However, we believe our Americas Recycling segment is one of the largest entities engaged in the recycling of nonferrous metals in the U.S. We are also a major regional processor of ferrous metal. The metal processing business is subject to cyclical fluctuations based upon the availability and price of unprocessed scrap metal and the demand for steel and nonferrous metals. In our Americas Recycling segment, we compete primarily on price and on the services we provide to scrap suppliers and generators. The price offered for scrap metal is the principal competitive factor in acquiring material from smaller scrap metals collection firms. Industrial generators of scrap metal may also consider factors other than price, such as supplying appropriate collection containers, timely removal, reliable documentation including accurate and detailed purchase records with customized reports, the ability to service multiple locations, insurance coverage, and the buyer's financial strength.
Our Americas Mills segment competes with regional, national and international manufacturers of steel. We produce a significant percentage of the total domestic output of rebar and merchant bar, and believe we are the largest manufacturer of rebar in the U.S. We do not produce a significant percentage of the total U.S. output of our other products. We compete primarily on the services we provide to our customers and on the price and quality of our products. See "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Industry" below.
Our Americas Fabrication segment competes with local, regional and national suppliers. We believe that we are among the largest fabricators of rebar in the U.S. We also believe that we are the largest manufacturer of steel fence posts in the U.S. We compete primarily on price, although we also compete based on the value-added services we provide to our customers, our speed of delivery, ability to service large projects and technical capability.  
Our International Mill segment competes with several large manufacturers of rebar and wire rod in Central and Eastern Europe, primarily on the basis of price, quality, delivery times and product availability. We believe we are the largest producer of merchant bars for the products we produce and the second largest producer of rebar and wire rod in Poland. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
A significant factor in our business is our compliance with environmental laws and regulations. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Industry" in this Annual Report. Compliance with and changes in various environmental requirements and environmental risks applicable to our industry may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Occasionally, we may be required to clean up or take remedial action with regard to sites we operate or formerly operated. We may also be required to pay for a portion of the cleanup or remediation cost at sites we never owned or at sites which we never operated, if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or "Superfund") and analogous state statutes, we could be responsible for both the costs of cleanup as well as for associated natural resource damages. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), or equivalent state agency, has named us as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at several federal Superfund sites or similar state sites. In some cases, these agencies allege that we are one of many PRPs responsible for the cleanup of a site because we sold scrap metals to, or otherwise disposed of materials at, the site. With respect to the sale of scrap metals, we contend that an arm's length sale of valuable scrap metal for use as a raw material in a manufacturing process that we do not control should not constitute "an arrangement for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances" as defined under federal law. In 1999, the Superfund Recycling Equity Act was signed into law which, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, provides legitimate sellers of scrap metal for recycling with some relief from Superfund liability under federal law. Despite Congress' clarification of the intent of the federal law, some state laws and environmental agencies still seek to impose such liability. We believe efforts to impose such liability are contrary to public policy objectives and legislation encouraging recycling and promoting the use of recycled materials, and we continue to support clarification of state laws and regulations consistent with Congress' action.
New federal, state and local laws, regulations and the varying interpretations of such laws by regulatory agencies and the judiciary impact how much money we spend on environmental compliance. In addition, uncertainty regarding adequate control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions impact our future expenditures in order to comply with environmental requirements. We cannot predict the total amount of capital expenditures or increases in operating costs or other expenses that may be required as a result of environmental compliance. We also do not know if we can pass such costs on to our customers through product price increases. During 2019, we incurred environmental costs including disposal, permits, license fees, tests, studies, remediation, consultant fees and environmental personnel expense of $42.5 million. In addition, we spent approximately $4.1 million on capital expenditures for environmental projects in 2019. We believe that our facilities are in material compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and 
regulations. We anticipate capital expenditures for new environmental control facilities during 2020 to be approximately $5.7 million.
