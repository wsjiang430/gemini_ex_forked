ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Precision Therapeutics Inc (the “Company” or “Precision”) is a healthcare products and services company that is expanding its business to take advantage of emerging areas of the dynamic healthcare market through sales of its products, through its partnership and its pending merger with Helomics Holding Corporation (“Helomics”) and through pursuit of other strategic relationships to build value. Precision’s business highlights include:

• | Precision produces and sells the STREAMWAY® System, which it considers to be the best solution to solve the issue of medical waste disposal, with a cost-effective and environmentally friendly technology which provides infection control associated with toxic waste management. Precision has historically focused on growing the market for this product in the U.S. and are developing international markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Precision has acquired 25% of the capital stock of Helomics and intends to consummate a merger with Helomics that is described elsewhere in this report, a pioneering Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) Services company that bridges two significant areas of the healthcare industry: “Precision Medicine” and “Big Data”. Precision has identified the CRO market as a burgeoning sector with significant growth potential. Precision is also partnering with Helomics in creating joint venture arrangements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In February 2018, Precision announced that Precision had formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TumorGenesis Inc., to develop the next generation, patient derived (“PDx”) tumor models for precision cancer therapy and drug development. Precision formed TumorGenesis to develop a new, rapid approach to growing tumors in the laboratory, which essentially “fools” the cancer cells into thinking they are still growing inside the patient. This approach should provide a much more relevant model of the patient tumor that may be used for testing of drugs for personalized therapy or for the development of new drugs. Testing of the TumorGenesis PDx tumors will take place in collaboration with Helomics. Precision entered into licensing agreements with three medical technology companies in that regard.

STREAMWAY System Business
 
Overview
 
We manufacture an environmentally-conscious system for the collection and disposal of infectious fluids resulting from surgical and other medical procedures. We have been granted patents in the United States, Canada and Europe, for the STREAMWAY System. We distribute our products to medical facilities where bodily and irrigation fluids produced during medical procedures must be contained, measured, documented and disposed. Our products minimize the exposure potential to the healthcare workers who handle such fluids. Our goal is to create products that dramatically reduce staff exposure without significant changes to established operative procedures, historically a major industry stumbling block to innovation and product introduction. In addition to simplifying the handling of these fluids, we believe our technologies provide cost savings to facilities over the aggregate costs incurred today using the traditional canister method of collection, neutralization, and disposal. We sell our products through an experienced direct sales force. The Company has one VP of Sales & Marketing, one VP of International Sales, and seven regional sales managers on staff as of March 2019. We have twelve independent distributors in the United States, Canada and overseas. We incorporated Skyline Medical Europe with an office in Belgium in February 2018 and hired a direct salesperson to cover Germany and France. We have contracted with two General Purchasing Organizations in the United States (Vizient and Intalere) providing customer exposure to more than 10,000 hospitals. The Company has contracted with Alliant Enterprises, LLC, a Service Disabled Veterans Owned Small Business supplier to the federal government. We have executed contracts with eleven international distributors: Quadromed, a Canadian distributor; MediBridge Sarl, a Swiss distributor; Device Technologies Australia PTY LTD, is an Australian distributor representing us throughout Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and the Pacific Islands; Century Scientific and Equipment Company in Kuwait; Mediurge in Pakistan; Prenit World in India; Sesneber in Saudi Arabia; Winner Scientific in Taiwan; Anifco in Bangladesh; Aras in the United Arab Emirates and Alfaisal Scientific Bureau in Iraq.
 
The STREAMWAY System is a wall-mounted fully-automated system that disposes an unlimited amount of suction fluid providing uninterrupted performance for physicians while virtually eliminating healthcare workers’ exposure to potentially-infectious fluids collected during surgical and other patient procedures. The system also provides an innovative way to dispose of ascites and pleural fluid with no evac bottles, suction canisters, transport or risk of exposure. The Company also manufactures and sells two disposable products required for the operation: a bifurcated dual port procedure filter with tissue trap and a single use bottle of cleaning solution. Both items are utilized on a single procedure basis and must be discarded after use.
 
Precision’s “virtually hands free direct-to-drain” technology (a) significantly reduces the risk of healthcare worker exposure to these infectious fluids by replacing canisters, (b) further reduces the risk of worker exposure when compared to powered canister technology that requires transport to and from the operating room, (c) reduces the cost per procedure for handling these fluids, and (d) enhances the surgical team’s ability to collect data to accurately assess the patient’s status during and after procedures.
 
Precision believes that the STREAMWAY System is unique to the industry in that it allows continuous suction to the procedural field and provides unlimited capacity to the user, so no procedure will ever have to be interrupted to change canisters. It is wall mounted and takes up no valuable operating room space. The System is designed to replace the manual process of collecting fluids in canisters and the transporting and dumping in sinks outside of the operating room which is still being used by many hospitals and surgical centers.
 
Precision believes its products provide substantial cost savings and improvements in safety in facilities that still use manual processes. In cases where healthcare organizations re-use canisters, the System eliminates the need for cleaning of those canisters. The System reduces safety issues facing healthcare workers, i.e. the cost of the handling process, and the amount of infectious waste generated versus the traditional method of disposing of canisters. The System is fully-automated, does not require transport to and from the operating room and eliminates any canister that requires emptying. It is positioned to penetrate the fluid waste management market segment due to its virtually hands-free operation, simple design, ease of use, continuous suction, continuous flow, unlimited capacity and efficiency in removal of infectious waste with minimal exposure of healthcare personnel to potentially infectious material.

Industry and Market Analysis
 
Infectious and Bio-hazardous Waste Management
 
There has long been recognition of the collective potential for ill effects to healthcare workers from exposure to infectious/bio-hazardous materials. Federal and state regulatory agencies have issued mandatory guidelines for the control of such materials, and in particular, bloodborne pathogens. OSHA’s Bloodborne Pathogens Standard 29 CFR 1910.1030 requires employers to adopt engineering and work practice controls that would eliminate or minimize employee exposure from hazards associated with bloodborne pathogens. The medical device industry has responded to this need by developing various products and technologies to limit exposure or to alert workers to potential exposure.
 
The presence of infectious materials is most prevalent in the surgical suite and post-operative care units where large amounts of bodily fluids, including blood, bodily and irrigation fluids, are continuously removed from the patient during the surgical procedure. Surgical teams and post-operative care personnel may be exposed to these potentially-serious hazards via direct contact of blood materials or, more indirectly, via splash and spray. One STREAMWAY System user stated “While working at a different facility, contaminated fluid splashed in my eye while changing a full suction canister. The patient was HIV-positive, so I had to be tested for the next 18 months. Luckily, I was not infected. But no one should have to go through that.”
 
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), workers in many different occupations are at risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens, including Hepatitis B and C, and HIV/AIDS. First aid team members, housekeeping personnel, nurses and other healthcare providers are examples of workers who may be at risk of exposure.
 
OSHA issued a Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to protect workers from this risk. In 2001, in response to the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, OSHA revised the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. The revised standard clarifies (and emphasizes) the need for employers to select safer needle devices and to involve employees in identifying and choosing these devices. The revised standard also calls for the use of “automated controls” as it pertains to the minimization of healthcare exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Additionally, employers are required to have an exposure control plan that includes universal precautions to be observed to prevent contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials, such as implementing work practice controls, requiring personal protective equipment and regulating waste and waste containment. The exposure control plan is required to be reviewed and updated annually to reflect new or modified tasks and procedures, which affect occupational exposure and to reflect changes in technology that eliminate or reduce exposure to bloodborne pathogens.
 
According to the American Hospital Association’s (AHA) Hospital Statistics, 2013 edition, America’s hospitals performed approximately 86 million surgeries. This number does not include the many procedures performed at surgery centers across the country. Based on the number of surgical procedures per 100,000 people published by The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, the number of surgeries in the United States, using 2016 census data, was 98,634,510 (almost 100,000,000). Using the 2018 census projected population number, the US would see approximately 100 million surgical procedures.
 
The majority of these procedures produce potentially-infectious materials that must be disposed with the lowest possible risk of cross-contamination to healthcare workers. Current standards of care allow for these fluids to be retained in canisters and located in the operating room where they can be monitored throughout the surgical procedure. Once the procedure is complete these canisters and their contents are disposed using a variety of methods, all of which include manual handling and result in a heightened risk to healthcare workers for exposure to their contents.

A study by the Lewin Group, prepared for the Health Industry Group Purchasing Association in April 2007, reports that infectious fluid waste accounts for more than 75% of U.S. hospitals biohazard disposal costs. The study also includes findings from a bulletin published by the University of Minnesota’s Technical Assistance Program, which stated, “A vacuum system that uses reusable canisters or empties directly into the sanitary sewer can help a facility cut its infectious waste volume, and save money on labor, disposal and canister purchase costs”. The Minnesota’s Technical Assistance Program bulletin also estimated that, in a typical hospital, “. . . $75,000 would be saved annually in suction canister purchase, management and disposal cost if a canister-free vacuum system was installed.”
 
We expect the hospital surgery market to continue to increase due to population growth, the aging of the population, expansion of surgical procedures to new areas (for example, use of the endoscope) which requires more fluid management and new medical technology.
 
There are approximately 40,000 operating rooms and surgical centers in the U.S. (AHA, Hospital Statistics, 2008). The hospital market has typically been independent of the U.S. economy; therefore, we believe that our targeted market is not cyclical and the demand for our products will not be heavily dependent on the state of the economy. We benefit by having our products address both the procedure market of nearly 51.6 million inpatient procedures (CDC, National Hospital Discharge Survey: 2010 table) as well as the hospital operating room market (approximately 40,000 operating rooms).
 
Current Techniques of Collecting Infectious Fluids
 
Typically, during the course of the procedure, fluids are continuously removed from the surgical site via wall suction and tubing and collected in large canisters (1,500 - 3,000 milliliters (ml) capacity or 1.5 – 3.0 liters) adjacent to the surgical table.
 
These canisters, made of glass or high impact plastic, have graduated markers on them allowing the surgical team to make estimates of fluid loss in the patient both intra-operatively as well as for post-operative documentation.  Fluid contents are retained in the canisters until the procedure is completed or until the canister is full and needs to be removed.  During the procedure, the surgical team routinely monitors fluid loss using the measurement calibrations on the canister and by comparing these fluid volumes to quantities of saline fluid introduced to provide irrigation of tissue for enhanced visualization and to prevent drying of exposed tissues.  After the procedure is completed, the fluids contained in the canisters are measured and a calculation of total blood loss is determined.  This is done to ensure no excess fluids of any type remain within the body cavity or that no excessive blood loss has occurred, both circumstances that may place the patient at an increased risk post-operatively.
 
Once total blood loss has been calculated, the healthcare personnel must dispose of the fluids.  This is typically done by manually transporting the fluids from the operating room to a waste station and directly pouring the material into a sink that drains to the sanitary sewer where it is subsequently treated by the local waste management facility, a process that exposes the healthcare worker to the most risk for direct contact or splash exposure.  Once emptied, these canisters are placed in large, red pigmented, trash bags and disposed of as infectious waste – a process commonly referred to as “red-bagging.”
 
Alternatively, the canisters may be opened in the operating room and a gel-forming powder is poured into the canister, rendering the material gelatinous.  These gelled canisters are then red-bagged in their entirety and removed to a bio-hazardous/infectious holding area for disposal.  In larger facilities, the canisters, whether pre-treated with gel or not, are often removed to large carts and transported to a separate special handling area where they are processed and prepared for disposal.  Material that has been red-bagged is disposed of separately, and more expensively, from other medical and non-medical waste by companies specializing in that method of disposal.
 
An even more cumbersome and dangerous method of fluid removal uses a product called an evacuated glass container often referred to as an evac bottle. These bottles have long been the accepted practice for fluid removal in procedure rooms where paracentesis and thoracentesis procedures are performed. The bottles have a 1-liter capacity and 5-8 of them are used on average for a large volume paracentesis. Procedure costs for the glass bottles alone can climb to $50 or $60. Furthermore, the added weight of the glass and fluid makes glass bottles one of the most expensive collection options on the market. The composition of the bottles makes these containers one of the most dangerous to handle.

Current protection and disposal techniques are helpful but fall short of providing adequate protection for the healthcare workers exposed to infectious waste.  A major spill of fluid from a canister, causing direct or indirect contact to blood-borne pathogens is a major concern and is one of the most serious risks any healthcare worker may face in the performance of his or her job.  Once a spill occurs, the entire area must be cleaned and disinfected and the exposed worker faces a potential of infection from bloodborne pathogens.  These pathogens include, but are not limited to, Hepatitis B and C, HIV/AIDS, HPV, and other infectious agents.  Given the current legal liability environment, the hospital, unable to identify at-risk patients due to concerns over patient rights and confidentiality, must treat every exposure incident as a potentially infectious incident and treat the exposed employee according to a specific protocol that is both costly to the facility and stressful to the affected employee and his or her co-workers.  In cases of possible exposure to communicable disease, the employee could be placed on paid administrative leave, frequently involving worker’s compensation, and additional workers must be assigned to cover the affected employee’s responsibilities.  The facility bears the cost of both the loss of the affected worker and the replacement healthcare worker in addition to any ongoing health screening and testing of the affected worker to confirm if any disease has been contracted from the exposure incident.   Canisters are the most prevalent means of collecting and disposing of infectious fluids in hospitals today.  Traditional, non-powered canisters and related suction and fluid disposable products are exempt and do not require FDA clearance.  


We believe that our virtually hands free direct-to-drain technology will (a) significantly reduce the risk of healthcare worker exposure to these infectious fluids by replacing canisters, (b) further reduce the risk of worker exposure when compared to powered canister technology that requires transport to and from the operating room, (c) reduce the cost per procedure for handling these fluids, and (d) enhance the surgical team’s ability to collect data to accurately assess the patient’s status during and after procedures.
 
In addition to the traditional canister method of waste fluid disposal, several other powered medical devices have been developed which address some of the deficiencies described above.  MD Technologies, Inc., Dornoch Medical Systems, Inc. (Zimmer), and Stryker Instruments have all developed systems that provide for disposal into the sanitary sewer without pouring the infectious fluids directly through a hopper disposal or using expensive gel powders and most are sold with 510(k) concurrence from the FDA.  Most of these competing products continue to utilize some variant on the existing canister technology, and while not directly addressing the canister, most have been successful in eliminating the need for an expensive gel and its associated handling and disposal costs.  Our existing competitors that already have products on the market have a clear competitive advantage over us in terms of brand recognition and market exposure.   In addition, the aforementioned companies have extensive marketing and development budgets that could overpower an emerging growth company like ours. We believe that Stryker Instruments has the dominant market share position.

The STREAMWAY Fluid Waste Management System (“System”) – Direct-to-Drain Medical Fluid Disposal
 
The STREAMWAY System suctions surgical waste fluid from the patient using standard surgical tubing. The waste fluid passes through our proprietary disposable filters and into our device. The STREAMWAY System maintains continuous suction to the procedural field at all times. A simple, easy to use Human Interface Display screen guides the user through the simple set up process, ensuring that a safe vacuum level is identified and set by the user for each procedure and additionally guides them through the cleaning process.
 
The STREAMWAY System is unique to our industry in that it allows for continuous suction to the surgical field and provides unlimited capacity to the user, so no surgical procedure will ever have to be interrupted to change canisters. It is wall mounted and takes up no valuable operating room space.
 
The System will replace the manual process of collecting fluids in canisters and transporting and dumping in sinks outside of the operating room that is still being used by many hospitals and surgical centers. The manual process, involving canisters, requires the operating room personnel to open the canisters that contain waste fluid, often several liters, at the end of the surgical procedure and either add a solidifying agent or empty the canisters in the hospital drain system. Some facilities require used canisters be cleaned by staff and reused. It is during these procedures that there is increased potential for contact with the waste fluid through splashing or spills. The System eliminates the use of canisters and these cleaning and disposal steps by collecting the waste fluid in the internal collection chamber and automatically disposing of the fluid with no handling by personnel.  Each procedure requires the use of a disposable filter. At the end of each procedure, a proprietary cleaning solution is attached to the System and an automatic cleaning cycle ensues, making the device ready for the next procedure.  The cleaning solution bottle and its contents are used to clean the internal fluid pathway in the device to which personnel have no exposure.  During the cleaning cycle, the cleaning solution is pulled from the bottle into the device, and then disposed in the same manner as the waste fluid from the medical procedure.  At the end of the cleaning cycle, the bottle is discarded and is 100% recyclable. The filter and any suction tubing used during the procedure will be disposed of in the same manner as suction tubing used with the canister system.  Handling of this tubing does present the potential for personnel exposure, but that potential is minimal.

We believe our product provides substantial cost savings and improvements in safety in facilities that still use manual processes. In cases where healthcare organizations re-use canisters, the System eliminates the need for cleaning of canisters for re-use.  The System reduces the safety issues facing operating room nurses, the cost of the handling process, and the amount of infectious waste generated when the traditional method of disposing of canisters is used.  The System is fully automated, does not require transport to and from the operating room and eliminates any canister that requires emptying.  We believe it is positioned to penetrate its market segment due to its virtually hands-free operation, simple design, ease of use, continuous suction, continuous flow, unlimited capacity and efficiency in removal of infectious waste with minimal exposure of operating room personnel to potentially infectious material.
 
In contrast to competitive products, the wall-mounted System does not take up any operating room floor space and it does not require the use of any external canisters or handling by operating room personnel.  It does require a dedicated system in each operating room where it is to be used.  The System is the only known direct-to-drain system that is wall-mounted and designed to collect, measure and dispose of, surgical waste.   Other systems on the market are portable, meaning that they are rolled to the bedside for the surgical case and then rolled to a cleaning area, after the surgery is complete, and use canisters, which still require processing or require a secondary device (such as a docking station) to dispose of the fluid in the sanitary sewer after it has been collected.  They are essentially powered canisters.  A comparison of the key features of the devices currently marketed and the System is presented in the table below.

The System may be installed on or in the wall during new hospital construction or renovation and is installed in any current operating room by connecting the device to the hospital’s existing sanitary sewer drain and wall suction systems.  With new construction or renovation, the system will be placed in the wall and the incremental costs are minimal, limited to connectors to the hospital drain and suction systems (which systems are already required in an operating room), the construction of a frame to hold the System in position and minimal labor.  The fluid collection chamber is internal to the device unit and requires no separate installation.  Based upon our consultations with several architects, we believe there is no appreciable incremental expense in planning for the System during construction.

For on-the-wall installation in a current operating room, the location of the System may be chosen based on proximity to the existing hospital drain and suction systems.  Installation will require access to those systems through the wall and connection to the systems in a manner similar to that for within-the-wall installation.  The System is mounted on the wall using a mounting bracket supplied with the system and standard stud or drywall attachments.
 
Once installed, the System has inflow ports positioned on the front of the device that effectively replace the current wall suction ports most commonly used to remove fluids during surgery.  Additionally, a disposable external filter, which is provided as part of our disposable cleaning kit, allows for expansion to additional inflow suction ports by utilizing one or two dual port filters.
 
Although the System is directly connected to the sanitary sewer, helping to reduce potential exposure to infectious fluids, it is possible that installation of the system will temporarily cause inconvenience and lost productivity as the operating rooms will need to be taken off line temporarily.
 
Current techniques utilized by Stryker, Cardinal Health, and other smaller companies typically utilizes two to eight canisters positioned on the floor or on elaborate rolling containers with tubing connected to the hospital suction system and to the operative field.  Once the waste fluids are collected, they must be transported out of the operating room and disposed of using various methods.  These systems take up floor space in and around the operating room and require additional handling by hospital personnel, thereby increasing the risk of exposure to infectious waste fluids generated by the operating room procedure.  Handling infectious waste in this manner is also costlier.
 
A summary of the features of the wall unit include:
 

• | Minimal Human Interaction. The wall-mounted System provides a small internal reservoir that keeps surgical waste isolated from medical personnel and disposes the medical waste directly into the hospital sanitary sewer with minimal medical personnel interaction. This minimal interaction is facilitated by the automated electronic controls and computerized LCD touch-screen allowing for simple and safe single touch operation of the device. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fluid Measurement. The STREAMWAY System volume measurement allows for in-process, accurate measurement of blood/saline suctioned during the operative procedure and eliminates much of the estimation of fluid loss currently practiced in the operating room. This is particularly important in minimally invasive surgical procedures, where accounting for all fluids, including saline added for the procedure, is vital to the operation. The physician and nursing team can also view in real time the color of the extracted or evacuated fluid through the viewing window on the system. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cleaning Solution. A bottle of cleaning solution, proprietary to and sold by us, is used for the automated cleaning cycle at the conclusion of each procedure and prepares the STREAMWAY System for the next use, reducing operating room turnover time. The cleaning solution is intended to clean the internal tubing, pathways, and chamber within the system. The cleaning solution bottle is easily attached to the STREAMWAY System by inserting the bottle into the mount located on the front of the unit and inverting the bottle. The automated cleaning process takes less than five minutes and requires minimal staff intervention. The disposable cleaning solution bottle collapses at the end of the cleaning cycle rendering it unusable; therefore, it cannot be refilled with any other solution. The instructions for use clearly state that our cleaning solution, and only our cleaning solution, must be used with the STREAMWAY System following each surgical case. The warranty is voided if any other solution is used. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Procedure Filters. One or two filters, depending on the type of procedure, will be used for every surgical procedure. The filter was developed by us, is proprietary to the STREAMWAY System and is only sold by us. The filter is a two port, bifurcated, disposable filter that contains check valves and a tissue trap that allows staff to capture a tissue sample and send to pathology if needed. The filters are disposed of after each procedure. The cleaning solution and filter disposables are expected to be a substantial revenue generator for the life of the STREAMWAY System.

• | Ease of Use. The System simply connects to the existing suction tubing from the operative field (causing no change to the current operative methods). Pressing the START button on the System touch screen enacts a step by step instruction with safety questions ensuring that the correct amount of suction is generated minimizing the learning curve for operation at the surgical site. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Installation. We arrange installation of the System through a partnership or group of partnerships. Such partners will include, but will not be limited to, local plumbers, distribution partners, manufacturer's representatives, hospital supply companies and the like. We train our partners and standardize the procedure to ensure the seamless installation of our products. The System is designed for minimal interruption of operating room and surgical room utilization. Plug-and-play features of the design allow for almost immediate connection and hook up to hospital utilities for wall-mounted units allowing for quick start-up post-installation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sales Channel Partners. The System is sold to end-users through a combination of independent stocking distributors, manufacturer’s representatives, and direct sales personnel. We intend that all personnel involved in direct contact with the end-user have extensive training and are approved by Skyline. We maintain exclusive agreements between Skyline and the sales channel partners outlining stocking expectations, sales objectives, target accounts and the like. Contractual agreements with the sales channel partners are reviewed on an annual basis and we expect that such agreements will contain provisions allowing them to be terminated at any time by Skyline based on certain specified conditions.

The Disposables
 
The Skyline disposables are a critical component of our business model. The disposables consist of a proprietary, pre-measured amount of cleaning solution in a plastic bottle that attaches to the System. The disposables also include a 2-port bifurcated single use in-line filter. The proprietary cleaning solution, placed in the specially designed holder, is attached and shall be used following each surgical procedure. Due to the nature of the fluids and particles removed during surgical procedures, the System should be cleaned following each use. The disposables have the “razor blade business model” characteristic with an ongoing stream of revenue for every System unit installed, and revenues from the sale of the disposables are expected to be significantly higher over time than the revenues from the sale of the unit. Our disposable bifurcated filter is designed specifically for use only on our System. The filter is used only once per procedure followed by immediate disposal. Our operating instructions and warranty require that a Skyline filter is used for every procedure. We have exclusive distribution rights to the disposable solution and facilitate the use of only our solution for cleaning following procedures by incorporating a special container to connect the fluid to the connector on the System. We also tie the fluid usage, which we keep track of with the System software, to the product warranty.
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret intellectual property rights and other measures to protect our intellectual property.
 
We spent approximately $526,000 in 2018 and $289,000 in 2017 on research and development.   On January 25, 2014, the Company filed a non-provisional PCT Application No. PCT/US2014/013081 claiming priority from the U.S. Provisional Patent Application, number 61756763 which was filed one year earlier on January 25, 2013. The Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) allows an applicant to file a single patent application to seek patent protection for an invention simultaneously in each of the 148-member countries of the PCT, including the United States. By filing this single “international” patent application through the PCT system, it becomes easier and more cost effective than by filing separate applications directly with each national or regional patent office in the various countries in which patent protection is desired.
 
The United States Patent Office has assigned application #14/763,459 to our previously filed PCT application.

As of November 22, 2017, the Company was informed that the European Patent Office allowed all our claims for application #14743665.3-1651 and we received a Notice of Intent to Grant.
 
As of July 11, 2018, the Company was informed that the European Patent #EP2948200 was granted and published validating in the following countries: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden.
 
Our PCT patent application is for an enhanced model of the surgical fluid waste management system. We utilize this enhanced technology in the updated version of the STREAMWAY System unit we began selling in the first quarter of 2014. We obtained a favorable International Search Report from the PCT searching authority indicating that the claims in our PCT application are patentable (i.e., novel and non-obvious) over the cited prior art. A feature claimed in the PCT application is the ability to maintain continuous suction to the surgical field while simultaneously measuring, recording and evacuating fluid to the facilities sewer drainage system. This provides for continuous operation of the STREAMWAY System unit in suctioning waste fluids, which means that suction is not interrupted during a surgical operation, for example, to empty a fluid collection container or otherwise dispose of the collected fluid. We believe that this continuous operation and unlimited capacity feature provides us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly on large fluid generating procedures. All competing products, except certain models of MD Technologies, have a finite fluid collection capacity, necessitating he devices be emptied when capacity is reached during the surgical procedure. In the case of MD Technologies while some of their models may have an unlimited capacity, their process is not continuous because it requires switching the vacuum containers when one becomes full. For example, when the first container becomes full, the vacuum is switched over to a second container to collect the fluid in the second container while the fluid in the first container is drained. When the second container becomes full, the vacuum is again switched back to the first container to collect fluid while the second container is drained, and so on. Even though the switching of the vacuum between containers is automated in certain MD Technology models, the automated switching results in brief interruptions or reductions in suction during the surgical procedure.
 
The Company holds the following granted patents in the United States, and a pending application in the United States on its earlier STREAMWAY models: US7469727, US8123731 and US Publication No. US20090216205 (collectively, the “Patents”). These Patents will begin to expire on August 8, 2023.
 
In general, the Patents are directed to a system and method for collecting waste fluid from a surgical procedure while ensuring there is no interruption of suction during the surgical procedure and no limit on the volume of waste fluid which can be collected. More particularly, the Patents claim a system and method in which waste fluid is suctioned or drawn into holding tanks connected to a vacuum source which maintains a constant negative pressure in the holding tanks. When the waste fluid collected in the holding tanks reaches a predetermined level, the waste fluid is measured and pumped from the holding tanks while maintaining the negative pressure. Therefore, because the negative pressure is maintained in the holding tanks, waste fluid will continue to be drawn into the holding tanks while the waste fluid is being pumped from the holding tanks. Thus, there is no limit to the volume of waste fluid which can be collected, and the suction at the surgical site is never interrupted during the surgical procedure.
 
We also rely upon trade secrets, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, in part, with confidentiality agreements with employees, although we cannot be certain that the agreements will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach.

Technology and Competition
 
Fluid Management for Surgical Procedures
 
The management of surgical waste fluids produced during and after surgery is a complex mix of materials and labor. It consists of the primary collection of fluid from the patient, transportation of the waste fluid within the hospital to a disposal or processing site and disposal of that waste either via incineration or in segregated landfills.
 
Once the procedure has ended the canisters and their contents currently being used in many cases, must be removed from the operating room and disposed.  There are several methods used for such disposal, all of which present certain risks to the operating room team, the crews who clean the rooms following the procedure and the other personnel involved in their final disposal.  These methods include:
 

• | Direct Disposal Through the Sanitary Sewer. In most all municipalities, the disposal of liquid blood may be done directly to the sanitary sewer where it is treated by the local waste management facility. This practice is approved and recommended by the EPA. In most cases, these municipalities specifically request that disposed bio-materials not be treated with any known anti-bacterial agents such as glutalderhyde, as these agents not only neutralize potentially infectious agents, but also work to defeat the bacterial agents employed by the waste treatment facilities themselves. Disposal through this method is fraught with potential exposure to the healthcare workers, putting them at risk for direct contact with these potentially-infectious agents through spillage of the contents or via splash when the liquid is poured into a hopper – a specially designated sink for the disposal of infectious fluids. Once the infectious fluids are disposed of into the hopper, the empty canister is sent to central processing for re-sterilization (glass and certain plastics) or for disposal with the bio-hazardous/infectious waste generated by the hospital (red-bagged). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Conversion to Gel for Red-Bag Disposal. In many hospital systems, the handling of liquid waste has become a liability issue due to worker exposure incidents and in some cases, has even been a point of contention during nurse contract negotiations. Industry has responded to concerns of nurses over splash and spillage contamination by developing a powder that, when added to the fluid in the canisters, produces a viscous, gel-like substance that can be handled more safely. After the case is completed and final blood loss is calculated, a port on the top of each canister is opened and the powder is poured into it. It takes several minutes for the gel to form, after which the canisters are placed on a service cart and removed to the red-bag disposal area for disposal with the other infectious waste. There are four major drawbacks to this system: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | It does not ensure protection for healthcare workers, as there remains the potential for splash when the top of the canister is opened.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Based on industry pricing data, the total cost per canister increases by approximately $2.00.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disposal costs to the hospital increase dramatically as shipping, handling and landfill costs are based upon weight rather than volume in most municipalities. The weight of an empty 2,500 ml canister is about 1 pound. A canister and its gelled contents weigh about 7.5 pounds, and the typical cost to dispose of medical waste is approximately $.30 per pound. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The canister filled with gelled fluid must be disposed; it cannot be cleaned and re-sterilized for future use.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Despite the increased cost of using gel and the marginal improvement in healthcare worker protection it provides, several hospitals have adopted gel as their standard procedure.
 
Drainage Systems
 
Several new medical devices have been developed which address some of the deficiencies described above. MD Technologies, Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Dornoch Medical Systems, Inc. (now Zimmer) and Stryker Instruments have all developed systems that provide disposal into the sanitary sewer without pouring the infectious fluids directly through a hopper disposal or using expensive gel powders. Most of these newer products are currently sold with 510(k) concurrence from the FDA. Most of these competing products incorporate an internal collection canister with finite capacity, and while not directly eliminating the need to transport a device to and from the surgical room, we believe most have been successful in eliminating the need for expensive gel and its associated handling and disposal costs.
 
Existing competitors that already have products on the market have a competitive advantage in terms of brand recognition and market exposure. In addition, the aforementioned companies have extensive marketing and development budgets that could overpower an early stage company like ours.
 
We believe Stryker Instruments has the dominant market share position. We also believe competing products are used in select procedures and often in some, but not all, surgical procedures.
 
Current Competition, Technology, and Costs
 
Single Use Canisters
 
In the U.S., glass reusable containers are infrequently used as their high initial cost, frequent breakage and costs of reprocessing are typically higher than single use high impact plastic canisters, even when disposal is factored in.  Each single use glass canister costs roughly $8.00 each while the high impact plastic canisters cost $2.00 - $3.00 each. It is estimated that a range of two to eight canisters are used in each procedure, depending on the operation. Our System is designed to replace the use of canisters and render them unnecessary, as storage and disposal would be performed automatically by the System.  In addition, we believe our true competitive advantage is our unlimited capacity, eliminating the need for any high-volume cases to be interrupted for canister changeover.

--

Solidifying Gel Powder
 
One significant drawback of the solidifying gels is that they increase the weight of the materials being sent to the landfill by a factor of five to seven times, resulting in a significant cost increase to the hospitals that elect to use the products. The System eliminates the need for solidifying gel, providing savings in both gel powder usage and associated landfill costs.
Sterilization and Landfill Disposal
 
Current disposal methods include the removal of the contaminated canisters (with or without the solidifying gel) to designated biohazardous/infectious waste sites.  Previously, many hospitals used incineration as the primary means of disposal, but environmental concerns at the international, domestic and local level have resulted in a systematic decrease in incineration worldwide as a viable method for disposing of blood, organs or materials saturated with bodily fluids.  When landfill disposal is used, canisters are included in the general red-bag disposal and, when gel is used, comprise a significant weight factor.  Where hopper disposal is still in use, most of the contents of the red-bag consist only of outer packaging of supplies used in surgery and small amounts of absorbent materials impregnated with blood and other waste fluid.  These, incidentally, are retained and measured at the end of the procedure to provide a more accurate assessment of fluid loss or retention.  Once at the landfill site, the red-bagged material is often steam-sterilized with the remaining waste being ground up and interred into a specially segregated waste dumpsite.
Handling Costs
 
Once the surgical team has finished the procedure, and a blood loss estimate is calculated, the liquid waste (with or without solidifying gels) is removed from the operating room and either disposed of down the sanitary sewer or transported to an infectious waste area of the hospital for later removal. The System significantly reduces the labor costs associated with the disposal of fluid or handling of contaminated canisters, as the liquid waste is automatically emptied into the sanitary sewer after measurements are obtained.  We utilize the same suction tubing currently being used in the operating room, so no additional cost is incurred with our process.  While each hospital handles fluid disposal differently, we believe the cost of our cleaning solution after each procedure will be less than the current procedural cost that could include the cost of canisters, labor to transport the canisters, solidifying powder, gloves, gowns, mops, goggles, shipping, and transportation, as well as any costs associated with spills that may occur due to manual handling.
 
A hidden, but very real and considerable handling cost, is the cost of infectious fluid exposure.  A July 2007 research article published in Infection Control Hospital Epidemiology, concluded that “Management of occupational exposures to blood and bodily fluids is costly; the best way to avoid these costs is by prevention of exposures.”  According to the article, hospital management costs associated with occupational blood exposure can, conservatively, be more than $4,500 per exposure.  Because of privacy laws, it is difficult to obtain estimates of exposure events at individual facilities; however, in each exposure, the healthcare worker must be treated as a worse case event.  This puts the healthcare worker through a tremendous amount of personal trauma and the health care facility through considerable expense and exposure to liability and litigation.


Nursing Labor
 
Nursing personnel spend significant time in the operating room, readying canisters for use, calculating blood loss and removing or supervising the removal of the contaminated canisters after each procedure.  Various estimates have been made, but an internal study at a large healthcare facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota, revealed that the average nursing team spends twenty minutes pre-operatively and intra-operatively setting up, monitoring fluid levels and changing canisters as needed and twenty minutes post-operatively readying blood loss estimates or disposing of canisters. Estimates for the other new technologies reviewed have noted few cost savings to nursing labor.
 
The System saves nursing time as compared to the manual process of collecting and disposing of surgical waste.  Set-up is as easy as attaching the suction tube to the port(s) of the disposable filter on the STREAMWAY System. Post-operative clean-up requires approximately five minutes, the time required to dispose of the suction tubing and disposable filter to the red-bag, calculate the patient’s blood loss, attach the bottle of cleaning solution to the System, initiate the cleaning cycle, and dispose of the emptied cleaning solution.  The steps that our product avoids, which are typically involved with the manual disposal process include, canister setup, interpretation of an analog read out for calculating fluid, canister management during the case (i.e. swapping out full canisters), and then temporarily storing, transferring, dumping, and properly disposing of the canisters.

Competitive Products
 
Disposable canister system technology for fluid management within the operating room has gone virtually unchanged for decades.  As concern for the risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens by healthcare workers, and the costs associated with canister systems has increased, market attention has increasingly turned toward fluid management.  The first quarter of 2001 saw the introduction of four new product entries within the infectious material control field.  Stryker Instruments introduced the “NeptuneTM” system, offering a combination of bio-aerosol and fluid management in a portable two-piece system; Waterstone Medical (now DeRoyal) introduced the “Aqua BoxTM” stationary system for fluid disposal; and Dornoch Medical Systems, Inc. (Zimmer) introduced the “Red AwayTM” stationary system for fluid collection and disposal.  All companies, regardless of size, have their own accessory kits.
 
We differentiate from these competitors since we are completely direct-to-drain and have the most automatic, hands-free process of any of the systems currently on the market.  Each of our competitors, with the exception of MD Technologies, Inc., has some significant manual handling involved in the process.  For instance, some competing products require transport of the mobile unit to a docking port and then emptying of the fluid, while others require that the canister be manually transported to a more efficient dumping station.  Regardless, most of our competitors require more human interaction with the fluid than our products do.  Please refer to the chart included in the section headed as Products for a comparison of the key features of the devices currently marketed and the STREAMWAY System.
 
Although the mobility associated with most of the competing products adds time and labor to the process and increases the chance of worker exposure to waste fluids, it also allows the hospital to purchase only as many mobile units needed for simultaneous procedures in multiple operating rooms.  With the System, a unit must be purchased and installed in each room where it is intended to be used.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
Distribution
 
We sell the System and procedure disposables through various methods that include a direct sales force and independent distributors covering the clear majority of major U.S. markets.  Currently we have one VP of Sales and eight regional sales managers selling, and demonstrating the System for prospective customers and distributors, as well as, supporting our current customer base for disposable resupply. We have signed contracts with two hospital purchasing groups; Vizient and Intalere. We have signed a contract with a SDVOSB distributor, Alliant Enterprises, LLC to distribute to the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense and other government contractors. We hired a Vice President of International Sales, in Q1 2018, who incorporated Skyline Medical Europe, a wholly owned subsidiary of Skyline Medical Inc. and hired a direct sales representative to handle Germany and France. We have contracted with distributors in Canada, Kuwait, Australia, the Pacific Islands, New Zealand, Switzerland, Pakistan, India, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Bangladesh, The United Arab Emirates and Iraq. Our targeted customer base includes nursing administration, operating room managers, interventional radiology managers, CFOs, CEOs, risk management, and infection control.  Other professionals with an interest in the product include physicians, nurses, biomedical engineering, anesthetists, imaging, anesthesiologists, human resources, legal, administration and housekeeping.
 
The major focus of our marketing efforts has been to introduce the System as a standalone device capable of effectively removing infectious waste and disposing of it automatically while providing accurate measurement of fluids removed, and also limiting exposure of the surgical team and healthcare support staff.

Governmental and professional organizations have become increasingly aggressive in attempting to minimize the risk of exposure by medical personnel to bloodborne pathogens.  We believe that the System provides a convenient and cost-effective way to collect and dispose of this highly contaminated material.
 
Most of our distributors have installation and service capability, and we contract those functions with an independent service/maintenance company.   We hired both distributors and service companies regarding these installation requirements.  We established extensive training and standards for the service and installation of the System to ensure consistency and dependability in the field.  Users of the system require a minimal amount of training to operate the System.  The instructions for use and the installation guide are included with every system along with a quick start guide, a troubleshooting manual and an on-board PLC controlling an intuitive touch screen with step by step instruction and safety features.
 
We have structured our pricing and relationships with distributors and/or service companies to ensure that these entities receive at least a typical industry level compensation for their activities.
 
Promotion
 
The dangers of exposure to infectious fluid waste are well recognized in the medical community.  It is our promotional strategy to effectively educate medical staff regarding the risks of contamination using current waste collection procedures and the advantages of the System in protecting medical personnel from inadvertent exposure.  We are leveraging this medical awareness and concern with education of regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal levels about the advantages of the System.
 
We supplement our sales efforts with a promotional mix that include a number of printed materials, video support and a website.  We believe our greatest challenge lies in reaching and educating the 1.6 million medical personnel who are exposed daily to fluid waste in the operating room or in other healthcare settings (OSHA, CPL 2-2.44C).  These efforts require utilizing single page selling pieces, video educational pieces for technical education, use of scientific journal articles and a webpage featuring product information, educational materials, and training sites.
 
We support our sales organization by attending and presenting at major scientific meetings where large numbers of potential users are in attendance.  The theme of our trade show booths focusses on education, the awareness of the hazards of infectious waste fluids and the Company’s innovative solution to the problem.   We have focused our efforts initially on the Association of Operating Room Nurses (“AORN”) meetings, where the largest concentration of potential buyers and influencers are in attendance and the Radiological Society of North America Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting.  We have partnered with the Association for Radiologic & Imaging Nursing (“ARIN”) and the American Healthcare Radiology Administrators (“AHRA”). We also attended Medica in Dusseldorf, Germany and Cirse in Lisbon, Portugal in 2018. We feature information on protection of the healthcare worker on our website as well as links to other relevant sites. We invested in limited journal advertising for targeted audiences that have been fully identified.  The initial thrust focuses on features of the product and ways of contacting the Company via the webpage or directly through postage paid cards or direct contact.
 
Pricing
 
We believe prices for the System and its disposables reflect a substantial cost savings to hospitals compared to their long-term procedure costs.  Our pricing strategy ensures that the customer realizes actual cost savings when using the System versus replacing traditional canisters, considering the actual costs of the canisters and associated costs such as biohazard processing labor and added costs of biohazard waste disposal.  Suction tubing that is currently used in the operating room will continue to be used with our system and should not be considered in the return on investment equation.    Our cleaning solution’s bottle is completely recyclable, and the selling price of the solution is part of the return on investment equation.  The 2-port disposable filter is also integral to our STREAMWAY System and is also part of the return on investment equation. In contrast, an operation using traditional disposal methods will often produce multiple canisters destined for biohazard processing.   Biohazard disposal costs are estimated by Outpatient Surgery Magazine to be 5 times more per pound to dispose of than regular waste (Outpatient Surgery Magazine, April 2007). Once the canister has touched blood, it is considered “red bag” biohazard waste, whereas the cleaning solution bottle used in the System can be recycled or disposed with the rest of the facility’s plastics.

The System lists for $24,900 per system (one per operating room) and $24 per unit retail for the proprietary disposables: one filter and one bottle of cleaning solution to the U.S. hospital market.   By comparison, the disposal system of Stryker Instruments, one of our competitors, retails for approximately $25,000 plus an $11,000 docking station and requires a disposable component with an approximate cost of $25 - $50 per procedure and a proprietary cleaning solution (cost unknown per procedure).  Per procedure cost of the traditional disposal process includes approximate costs of $2 - $3.00 per liter canister, plus solidifier at $2 per liter canister, plus the biohazard premium disposal cost approximated at $1.80 per liter canister.  In addition, the labor, gloves, gowns, goggles, and other related material handling costs are also disposal expenses.
 
Installation is done by distributors, independent contractors, or in-house engineering at an estimated price of $300 - $1,000, depending on the operating room.  Installation of the System requires access only to the hospital’s sanitary sewer, vacuum suction, and electricity.  To help facilities maintain their utilization rates, we recommend installation during off peak hours.  In smaller facilities, an outside contractor may be called in, while larger institutions have their own installation and maintenance workforce.  Installation time should not seriously impact the use of the operating room.  Each System has an industry standard warranty period that can be extended through documented use of our disposables: one filter and one bottle of cleaning solution per procedure.
 
Engineering and Manufacturing
 
We are currently manufacturing the System in a leased facility. We have the capability to manufacture, test, house, ship and receive from our warehouse. We contracted a manufacturing company, Wair Products in Bloomington, Minnesota, that meets our standards and requirements and that can produce six times the amount of System’s produced in-house at our facility monthly as sales increase.
 
The disposables, including a bottle of proprietary cleaning solution and a 2-port disposable filter, are sourced through Diversified Manufacturing Corporation (cleaning solution) situated in Prescott, Wisconsin and MPP Corporation (filters), located in Osceola, Wisconsin that has tooled to manufacture our own newly designed disposable filter.
 
Government Regulation
 
To date, no regulatory agency has established exclusive jurisdiction over the area of biohazardous and infectious waste in healthcare facilities. Several organizations maintain oversight function concerning various aspects of pertinent technologies and methods of protection.
 
These agencies include:
 

• | OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)
--+--------------------------------------


• | DOT (Department of Transportation)

--

The 60601-1 3rd edition certification for our STREAMWAY System is valid and enables us to continue to market and sell our product domestically and internationally.
 
Skyline Medical contracted with TUV (a nationally recognized testing laboratory-NRTL) to certify our STREAMWAY System to the new 60601-1 3rd Edition in late 2016. We attained certification to the new standard, and then submitted it to our Notified Body (BSI) for recommendation for our CE Mark, which we received in June 2017, allowing us to sell products outside of the United States.
 
Effective November 21, 2016, the Company received a Medical Device Establishment License to sell the STREAMWAY System and related disposables in Canada.
 
FDA Clearance under Section 510(k)
 
The FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health requires 510(k) submitters to provide information that compares its new device to a marketed device of a similar type, in order to determine whether the device is substantially equivalent (“SE”).
 
This means that a manufacturer can submit a 510(k) comparing a new device to a device that has been found to be SE and the FDA can use this as evidence to determine whether the new device is SE to an already legally marketed device (or a “predicate device”). The ultimate burden of demonstrating the substantial equivalence of a new device to a predicate device remains with the 510(k) submitter, and in those occasions when the Center for Devices and Radiological Health is unfamiliar with certain aspects of the predicate device, the submitter will be required to provide information that substantiates a claim of substantial equivalence.
 
As a matter of practice, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health generally considers a device to be SE to a predicate device if, in comparison to the predicate device, (i) the new device has the same intended use, (ii) the new device has the same technological characteristics (i.e., same materials design, energy source), (iii) the new device has new technological characteristics that could not affect safety or effectiveness, or (iv) the new device has new technological characteristics that could affect safety or effectiveness, but there are accepted scientific methods for evaluating whether safety or effectiveness has been adversely affected and there is data to demonstrate that the new technological features have not diminished safety or effectiveness. Pre-market notification submissions are designed to facilitate these determinations.
 
The FDA requires, pursuant to a final regulation for Establishment Registration and Device Listing for Manufacturers of Devices, that a 510(k) premarket notification be submitted at least ninety days before marketing a device that: (1) is being introduced into distribution for the first time by that person or entity, or (2) is in distribution but is being significantly modified in design or use.  A 510(k) submission must contain, among other things: (i) proposed labeling sufficient to describe the device’s intended use; (ii) a description of how the device is similar or different from other devices of comparable type, or information about what consequences a proposed device modification may have on the device's safety and effectiveness; and (iii) any other information necessary to determine whether the device is substantially equivalent.  The System is a Class II device, which is less stringently reviewed as that of a Class III device.  Our Senior Vice President of Operations has numerous years’ of experience in the FDA clearance process and has a team of regulatory consultants with significant experience in the FDA clearance process.
 
We filed the 510(k) submission for clearance of the System device on March 14, 2009 and received written confirmation on April 1, 2009 that our 510(k) has been cleared by the FDA.
 
Following this 510(k) clearance by the FDA, we continue to be subject to the normal ongoing audits and reviews by the FDA and other governing agencies.  These audits and reviews are standard and typical in the medical device industry, and we do not anticipate being affected by any extraordinary guidelines or regulations.
 
Skyline Medical has successfully passed FDA audits over the past few years, with no observations or 483 warning letters issued.

ISO Certification
 
Skyline Medical hired BSI (British Standards Institute) to be its Notified Body and to audit the Company to ISO 13485:2003 Standards. On June 1, 2016, Skyline successfully passed the audit of our Quality Management System and received its Certificate of Registration for ISO 13485:2016. Our certificate number is FM 649810.
 
The CRO Business
 
Investment in and Partnership with and pending merger with Helomics – CRO Services
 
Our CRO services business is committed to improving the effectiveness of cancer therapy using the power of artificial intelligence (“AI”) applied to rich data diseases databases. We have identified the CRO market as a burgeoning sector with significant growth potential. We have acquired 25% of the capital stock of Helomics®, a Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) Services company that bridges two significant areas of the healthcare industry: “Precision Medicine” and “Big Data”. On March 22, 2019, our stockholders approved the pending Merger. We and Helomics believe that the Merger will enable both companies to enhance potential value for stockholders, and that both companies will benefit from the Merger.
 
Helomics Holding Corporation is the successor to Helomics Corporation, which was incorporated on November 17, 2016 in Delaware. On December 7, 2016, Helomics, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Helomics Intermediate Corporation, acquired all of the outstanding shares of the Helomics Corporation. Since that time, Helomics has gone through a reorganization to reset the business model as well as bring the cost structure in line with Helomics’ new mission.
 
Helomics is a personalized medicine company that harnesses the patient’s own tumor to provide actionable insights to help guide oncologist’s treatment decisions. Helomics has a platform it believes to be unique, that interrogates the patient’s living tumor using a set of genomic and functional tests that determine how the tumor responds to drugs. This tumor profile is then compared with an extensive in-house knowledgebase of over 150,000 cancer cases to help individualize treatment, using an AI powered analytics platform. This unique functional approach offers more powerful insights for precision medicine compared to just knowing gene variations of the tumor, which are often not actionable with currently approved drugs or drugs in trials.
 
Helomics focuses its precision medicine approach on six specific cancers (ovarian, breast, pancreatic, colon, lung and brain cancer), and Helomics intends to be the world leader in the artificial intelligence for those six cancers, providing actionable data that can facilitate the development of precision therapies. The Helomics business comprises three key strategic areas:
 
Precision Oncology Insights. The Helomics Precision Oncology Insight service provides an actionable roadmap for patients and their oncologist to guide therapy and positively impact patient outcomes using AI-driven evidence-based molecular decision making. Our approach combines comprehensive molecular profiling of the patient tumor using NGS and other technologies, together with testing the drug response of the patient tumor grown in the laboratory using Helomics’ proprietary TruTumor™ model. Our D-CHIP AI-driven bioinformatics platform uses this data to continually learn which approved Standard-of-Care drugs will work best for a particular tumor profile. We then provide an actionable roadmap to guide patient therapy to the oncologist partnering with them to understand outcomes and improve and enrich the D-CHIP platform. Specializing in Ovarian cancer, Helomics offers oncologists the value of the accumulated knowledge of all tumors tested to their patients.
Boutique Contract Research Services. With a 17,400-square foot state-of-art, BSL-2, CLIA regulated laboratory in Pittsburgh, PA, Helomics offers a wide range of genomic (NGS, Microarray), proteomic, digital pathology, tissue culture and biorepository services to pharmaceutical and diagnostics clients. Helomics’ CRO services address a range of needs from discovery, through clinical and translational research, to clinical trials and diagnostics development and validation. Using our unique proprietary TruTumor patient derived tumor model we are able to offer a high throughput, high content approach to screening for new therapies, biomarker discovery and diagnostic development. Coupled with our D-CHIP platform we also offer bioinformatics services for in-depth data analysis and reporting for clinical and translational research

D-CHIP AI-platform. The Helomics D-CHIP platform is an AI-powered bioinformatics engine coupled to a multi-Helomics database of biochemical and clinical information on patients with cancer. D-CHIP uses deep learning to understand the association between the mutational profile of the patient’s tumor and the drug response profile of tumor grown in the lab. This approach generates actionable insights that deliver a comprehensive picture of which mutations in the tumor are associated with drugs to which the tumor is sensitive. Helomics partners with pharmaceutical, diagnostic and healthcare clients in projects that use D-CHIP for to drive patient recruitment and selection, biomarker discovery and development, and drug repurposing initiatives.
 
Precision Therapeutics and Helomics announced a proposed joint venture with GLG Pharma focused on using their combined technologies to bring personalized medicines and testing to ovarian and breast cancer patients, especially those who present with ascites fluid (over one-third of patients). This partnership will add a collection method to the STREAMWAY System, using GLG’s Capture, Culture and Screening capabilities. We also continue to explore other opportunities to partner with revenue-generating companies and create near-term and long-term value for our shareholders. The growth strategy in this business includes securing new partnerships and considering acquisitions in the precision medicine space.
 
TumorGenesis Business – Development of PDx Tumor Models
 
We recently formed a subsidiary, TumorGenesis, to pursue a new rapid approach to growing tumors in the laboratory, which essentially “fools” the cancer cells into thinking they are still growing inside the patient. TumorGenesis intends to develop next generation, patient derived, (“PDx”) tumor models for precision cancer therapy and drug development. This approach should provide a much more relevant model of the patient tumor that may be used for testing of drugs for personalized therapy or for the development of new drugs. We have entered into licensing arrangements with three medical technology companies in that regard.
 
TumorGenesis has secured a license agreement with 48Hour Discovery (“48HD”) which grants it access to 48HD’s ligand discovery technology. This follows a license agreement with SyntArray, LLC and is the latest milestone in the Company’s strategy to bring together ground-breaking technologies to develop the next generation of patient derived (“PDx”) tumor models for precision cancer therapy and drug development. TumorGenesis is developing a new approach to growing tumor models in the laboratory that is faster, less costly and more closely mimics the characteristics of the patient’s tumor, than the traditional PDx animal models that are currently on the market. TumorGenesis’ innovative approach is comprised of three key steps: first, the tumor cells from the patient tumor biopsy are tagged using peptides targeted to the patient’s specific cancer cells; second, the tags adhere the cells to a 3D biomimetic support in the well of a standard 96 well microplate; and third, the tumor cells are grown in the 3D culture system until ready for testing. The 48HD ligand discovery technology is vital to the first step in this process as it screens the patient’s tumor cells against large peptide libraries to identify the specific peptide ligands that bind to those cells. Once identified by 48HD’s technology, SyntArray’s targeted peptide cell capture technology screens these peptides to determine the best combination that will capture the cancer cells and allow them to attach and grow on the 3D biomimetic support.
 
We believe TumorGenesis is developing a better way to grow tumors outside the human body so they mimic the environment inside the patients’ body as closely as possible. This model is expected to create more accurate results when testing drugs for personalized therapy and when developing new drugs, compared to testing with traditional animal or cell culture models. The innovative 48HD technology allows us to capture all the heterogeneity of the tumor, including both the cancerous and non-cancerous cells. This is key to reassembling the tumor on an artificial ‘scaffold’, or 3D biomimetic support, so it grows in a way that closely mimics the patient’s body. This will allow us to offer a superior clinical testing environment which should drive lucrative partnerships with pharmaceutical companies as they develop new precision medicines and cancer therapies.
 
Testing of patient tumors using the TumorGenesis approach is expected to: (a) provide a personalized therapy protocol for a patient, (b) provide high-quality data on cancer tumors for a platform based on the D-CHIP Artificial Intelligence platform of Helomics Corporation, pursuant to Precision Therapeutics’ partnership with Helomics, and (c) drive partnerships with pharma companies for the development of new therapies, generating revenues for Precision Therapeutics. The TumorGenesis PDx model will initially be developed for three orphan cancers, Multiple Myeloma, Triple-Negative Breast cancer (TNBC) and Ovarian cancers, all of which are areas that have a high unmet need for new and effective treatments that are tailored to patients’ unique tumor profiles. Testing of the TumorGenesis PDx tumors will take place in collaboration with Helomics.
