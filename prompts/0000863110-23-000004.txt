ITEM 1. 
BUSINESS
 
General Information
 
Artesian Resources Corporation, or Artesian Resources, is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1927, that is the holding company of eight wholly-owned subsidiaries offering water, wastewater and other services in Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania.  The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 664 Churchmans Road, Newark, Delaware 19702.  Our principal subsidiary, Artesian Water Company, Inc., is the oldest and largest investor-owned public water utility on the Delmarva Peninsula, and has been providing superior water service since 1905.  We distribute and sell water, including water for public and private fire protection, to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and utility customers in the states of Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania.  We provide wastewater services to customers in Delaware. In addition, we provide contract water and wastewater operations, and water, sewer and internal Service Line Protection Plans. Our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and trades under the symbol “ARTNA.”  Our Class B Common Stock trades on the Nasdaq’s OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “ARTNB.”
 
Artesian Resources is the holding company of five regulated public utilities: Artesian Water Company, Inc., or Artesian Water, Artesian Water Pennsylvania, Inc., or Artesian Water Pennsylvania, Artesian Water Maryland, Inc., or Artesian Water Maryland, Artesian Wastewater Management, Inc., or Artesian Wastewater, and Artesian Wastewater Maryland, Inc., or Artesian Wastewater Maryland; and three non-utility subsidiaries: Artesian Utility Development, Inc., or Artesian Utility, Artesian Development Corporation, or Artesian Development, and Artesian Storm Water Services, Inc., or Artesian Storm Water.  Effective January 14, 2022, Artesian Wastewater is the holding company of Tidewater Environmental Services, Inc. dba Artesian Wastewater, or TESI, a regulated public utility.  The terms “we,” “our,” “Artesian,” and the “Company” as used herein refer to Artesian Resources and its subsidiaries.  The business activity conducted by each of our subsidiaries is discussed below under separate headings.
 
Our Market
 
Our current market area is the Delmarva Peninsula.  Our largest service area is in the State of Delaware.  Substantial portions of Delaware, particularly outside of northern New Castle County, are not served by a public water or wastewater system and represent potential opportunities for Artesian Water and Artesian Wastewater to obtain new exclusive franchised service areas. We continue to focus resources on developing and serving existing service territories and obtaining new territories throughout Delaware.
 
We hold Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity, or CPCNs, for approximately 305 square miles of exclusive water service territory, most of which is in Delaware with some territory being in Maryland and Pennsylvania.  Our largest connected regional water system, consisting of approximately 141 square miles and 78,600 metered customers, is located in northern New Castle County and portions of southern New Castle County, Delaware.  We hold CPCNs for approximately 58 square miles of wastewater service territory located in Sussex County, Delaware.  In January 2022, approximately 23 square miles of wastewater service territory, located in Sussex County, Delaware, was added upon the closing of the acquisition of TESI.  A significant portion of our exclusive service territory is in Sussex County, Delaware and remains undeveloped, and if and when development occurs and there is population growth in these areas, we anticipate we will increase our customer base by providing water and/or wastewater service to the newly developed areas and new customers.
 
Subsidiaries
 
Artesian Water
 
Artesian Water, our principal subsidiary, distributes and sells water to residential, commercial, industrial, governmental, municipal and utility customers throughout the State of Delaware.  In addition, Artesian Water provides services to other water utilities, including operations and billing functions, and has contract operation agreements with private, municipal and state water providers.  Artesian Water also provides water for public and private fire protection to customers in our service territories.  Artesian Water produced approximately 79% of our 2022 consolidated operating revenues. In May 2022, Artesian Water completed its purchase of substantially all of the water operating assets from the Town of Clayton, or Clayton, a Delaware municipality located in Kent County, Delaware.  This purchase agreement is discussed further in the “Strategic Direction and Recent Developments” section.
 
We derive about 90% of our self-supplied groundwater from wells that pump groundwater from aquifers and other formations located in the Atlantic Coastal Plain.  The remaining 10% of our groundwater supply comes from wells in the Piedmont Province.  We use a variety of treatment methods, including aeration, pH adjustment, chlorination, fluoridation, ultra violet oxidation, arsenic removal, nitrate removal, radium removal, iron removal, and carbon adsorption to meet federal, state and local water quality standards.  Additionally, a corrosion inhibitor is added to our self-supplied groundwater and to supply from interconnections.  We have 61 different water treatment facilities in our Delaware systems.  All water supplies that we purchase from neighboring utilities are potable.  
   4




To supplement our groundwater supply, we purchase treated surface water through interconnections only in the northern service area of our New Castle County, Delaware system.  The treated surface water is blended with our groundwater supply for distribution to our customers.  Nearly 95% of the overall 8.6 billion gallons of water we distributed in all of our Delaware systems during 2022 came from our groundwater wells, while the remaining 5% came from interconnections with other utilities and municipalities.  In Delaware in 2022, we pumped an average of 22.2 million gallons per day, or mgd, from our groundwater wells and obtained an average of approximately 1.3 mgd from interconnections.  Our peak water supply capacity currently is approximately 57.7 mgd.  We believe that we have in place sufficient capacity to provide water service for the foreseeable future to all existing and new customers in all of our service territories.
 
Most of our New Castle County, Delaware water system is interconnected.  In the remainder of the State of Delaware, we have several satellite systems that have not yet been connected by transmission and distribution facilities.  We intend to join these systems into larger integrated regional systems through the construction of a transmission and distribution network as development continues and our expansion efforts provide us with contiguous exclusive service territories.
 
In Delaware, we have 21 interconnections with two neighboring water utilities and six municipalities that provide us with the ability to purchase or sell water.  An interconnection agreement with Chester Water Authority, that expired December 31, 2021, had a “take or pay” clause requiring us to purchase 3.0 mgd.  The current agreement with Chester Water Authority, which is effective from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2026, includes automatic five-year renewal terms, unless terminated by either party, and has a “take or pay” clause which required us to purchase water on a step-down schedule through July 5, 2022 and now requires us to purchase a minimum of 0.5 mgd.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we were serving customers through approximately 1,442 miles of transmission and distribution mains.  Mains range in diameter from two inches to twenty-four inches, and most of the mains are made of ductile iron or cast iron.
 
We have 35 storage tanks in Delaware, most of which are elevated, providing total system storage of approximately 44.0 million gallons. We have developed and are using an Aquifer Storage and Recovery, or ASR, system in New Castle County, Delaware.  Our ASR system provides approximately 130.0 million gallons of storage capacity, which can be withdrawn at an average rate of approximately 1.0 mgd.  At some locations, we rely on hydro-pneumatic tanks to maintain adequate system pressures.  Where possible, we combine our smaller satellite systems with systems having elevated storage facilities.
 
Artesian Water Maryland
 
Artesian Water Maryland began operations in August 2007.  Artesian Water Maryland distributes and sells water to residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in Cecil County, Maryland.  Artesian Water Maryland owns and operates 9 public water systems.
 
The majority of the 0.1 billion gallons of water we distributed in all of our Maryland systems during 2022 came from our groundwater wells, while a portion came from treated surface water.  We have ten separate water treatment facilities in our Maryland systems.  We have one water treatment facility that treats surface water through an intake in the Susquehanna River, located in Cecil County, Maryland, which has the ability to supply up to 1.0 mgd of water.  Our peak water supply capacity currently is approximately 2.0 mgd.  We have 8 storage tanks capable of storing approximately 2.5 million gallons.  We believe that we have in place sufficient capacity to provide water service for the foreseeable future to all existing and new customers in all of our service territories.
 
In Maryland, we have one interconnection with the Artesian Water system in Delaware, one interconnection with a neighboring utility, and four interconnections with municipalities.  These interconnections are capable of providing over 3.0 mgd of water to our Maryland systems.
 
Artesian Water Pennsylvania
 
Artesian Water Pennsylvania began operations in 2002.  It provides water service to a residential community in Chester County, Pennsylvania.
 
Artesian Wastewater
 
Artesian Wastewater began providing wastewater services in Sussex County, Delaware in July 2005.  Artesian Wastewater is a regulated entity that owns wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure and provides wastewater services to customers in Delaware as a regulated public wastewater service company.
   5




Artesian Wastewater owns and operates four wastewater treatment facilities, which, combined, are permitted to treat and/or dispose of approximately 2.3 mgd.  Artesian Wastewater and Sussex County, a political subdivision of Delaware, provide reciprocal services to address the need of each for additional wastewater treatment and disposal capacity in certain service areas within Sussex County.  Artesian Wastewater received an operations permit in March 2020 for a disposal facility that includes a 90-million gallon storage lagoon and spray irrigation to agricultural land.  This facility provides treated process wastewater disposal services for an industrial customer at a rate up to 1.5 mgd.  We began operating this facility in late June 2021, shortly after the industrial customer received its process wastewater treatment operating permit.
 
TESI
 
In January 2022, Artesian Wastewater acquired Tidewater Environmental Services, Inc.  Artesian Wastewater operates as the parent holding company of Tidewater Environmental Services, Inc. dba Artesian Wastewater, or TESI.  TESI was incorporated in 2004 and is a regulated entity that owns wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure and provides wastewater services to customers in Sussex County, Delaware as a regulated public wastewater service company.  Artesian Wastewater purchased all of the stock of TESI from Middlesex Water Company, or Middlesex, for $6.4 million in cash and other consideration, including forgiveness of a $2.1 million note due from Middlesex.  This acquisition more than doubled the number of wastewater customers served by Artesian’s Delaware wastewater subsidiaries in Sussex County, Delaware and included all residents within the Town of Milton, Delaware.
 
TESI owns and operates seven wastewater treatment facilities, which, combined, are permitted to treat and/or dispose of approximately 713,000 gallons per day.
 
Artesian Wastewater Maryland
 
 Artesian Wastewater Maryland was incorporated on June 3, 2008 and is authorized and able to provide regulated wastewater services to customers in the State of Maryland.  It is currently not providing these services.


Artesian Utility
 
Artesian Utility was formed in 1996 and designs and builds water and wastewater infrastructure and provides contract water and wastewater operation services on the Delmarva Peninsula to private, municipal and governmental institutions.  Artesian Utility also evaluates land parcels, provides recommendations to developers on the size of water or wastewater facilities and the type of technology that should be used for treatment at such facilities and operates water and wastewater facilities in Delaware for municipal and governmental agencies.  Artesian Utility also contracts with developers and government agencies for design and construction of wastewater infrastructure throughout the Delmarva Peninsula.
 
Artesian Utility currently operates wastewater treatment facilities for the Town of Middletown, in southern New Castle County, Delaware, or Middletown, under a 20-year contract that expires in July 2039.  Artesian Utility currently operates three wastewater treatment systems with a combined capacity of up to approximately 3.8 mgd.  The wastewater treatment facilities in Middletown provide reclaimed wastewater for use in spray irrigation on public and agricultural lands in the area.
 
Artesian Utility also offers three protection plans to customers, the Water Service Line Protection Plan, or WSLP Plan, the Sewer Service Line Protection Plan, or SSLP Plan, and the Internal Service Line Protection Plan, or ISLP Plan (collectively, SLP Plans).  The WSLP Plan covers all parts, material and labor required to repair or replace participating customers' leaking water service lines up to an annual limit. The SSLP Plan covers all parts, material and labor required to repair or replace participating customers' leaking or clogged sewer lines up to an annual limit.  The ISLP Plan enhances available coverage to include water and wastewater lines within customers' residences up to an annual limit.
 
Artesian Development
 
Artesian Development is a real estate holding company that owns properties, including land approved for office buildings, a water treatment plant and wastewater facility, as well as property for current operations, including an office facility in Sussex County, Delaware.  The office facility consists of approximately 10,000 square feet of office space along with nearly 10,000 square feet of warehouse space.
Artesian Storm Water
 
 Artesian Storm Water, incorporated in 2017, was formed to provide design, installation, maintenance and repair services related to existing or proposed storm water management systems in Delaware and the surrounding areas.  The ability to offer storm water services will complement the primary water and wastewater services that we provide.  Artesian Storm Water is not actively seeking new opportunities.

Government Regulations
 
Overview
 
The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
 
These regulations include state commission orders, environmental protection, securities and exchange activities, including financial reporting and internal controls processes, data protection and privacy, tax compliance, health and safety, labor and employment practices, and other general business activities.
State Regulatory Commission Matters
 
Our water and wastewater utility operations are subject to regulation by their respective state regulatory commissions, which have broad administrative power and authority to regulate rates charged for service, determine franchise areas and conditions of service, approve acquisitions, authorize the issuance of securities and the incurrence of indebtedness, and other matters.  The profitability of our utility operations is influenced, to a great extent, by the timeliness and adequacy of regulatory relief we are granted by the respective regulatory commissions or authorities in the states in which we operate.  See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent regulatory proceedings.
Service Territory Expansion
 
In Delaware, a CPCN grants a water or wastewater company the exclusive right to serve all existing and new customers within a designated area.  The Delaware Public Service Commission, or DEPSC, has the authority to issue and revoke these CPCNs.  In this Form 10-K, we may refer to CPCNs as "franchises" or "service territories."
 
For a water company, the DEPSC may grant a CPCN under circumstances where there has been a determination that the water in the proposed service area does not meet the regulations governing drinking water standards of the Delaware Division of Public Health, or DPH, for human consumption or where the supply is insufficient to meet the projected demand.  For a wastewater company, the DEPSC has jurisdiction over non-governmental wastewater utilities having fifty or more customers in the aggregate.  A CPCN for water and wastewater utilities shall be granted by the DEPSC to applicants in possession of one of the following:
 
 
- | a signed service agreement with the developer of a proposed subdivision or development, which subdivision or development has been duly approved by the respective county government; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | a petition requesting such service signed by a majority of the landowners of the proposed territory to be served; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | a duly certified copy of a resolution from the governing body of a county or municipality requesting the applicant to provide service to the proposed territory to be served. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



A water or wastewater utility that has a CPCN must obtain the approval of the DEPSC to abandon a service territory.  Once a CPCN is granted to a water or wastewater utility, it may not be suspended or terminated unless the DEPSC determines in accordance with its rules and regulations that good cause exists for any such suspension or termination.  Although we have been granted an exclusive franchise for each of our existing water and wastewater systems in Delaware, our ability to expand service areas can be affected by the DEPSC awarding franchises to other regulated water or wastewater utilities with whom we compete for such franchises.
 
In Maryland, the Company must obtain approval from the appropriate local government authority for the ability to serve a particular area and also ensure that the acquired area is in the county’s master water and sewer plan.  The authority to exercise a franchise must then be obtained from the Maryland Public Service Commission, or MDPSC.  Utilities that seek to develop a franchise by constructing new facilities must obtain appropriate approvals from the Maryland Department of the Environment, or MDE, the local government and the MDPSC.  The utility must also obtain approval for soil and erosion plans and easement agreements from appropriate parties.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
The United States Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, or DNREC, and DPH, regulate the water quality of our treatment and distribution systems in Delaware, as do the EPA and the MDE, with respect to our operations in Maryland.  The Chester Water Authority, which supplies water to Artesian Water through an interconnection in northern New Castle County, is regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, as well as the EPA.  We believe that we are in material compliance with all current federal, state and local water quality standards, including regulations under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. However, if new water quality regulations are too costly, or if we fail to comply with such regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and planned capital investments.
   7




The water industry is capital intensive, with one of the highest levels of capital investment in plant and equipment per dollar of revenue among all utilities.  Increasingly stringent drinking water regulations adopted to meet the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act have required the water industry to invest in more advanced treatment systems and processes, which require a heightened level of expertise.  We have made significant enhancements to existing facilities to effectively treat and remove compounds as required by government agencies, such as ultra violet oxidation treatment, ceramic membrane filtration and carbon filtration.  We are currently in full compliance with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act.  Even though our water utility was founded in 1905, the majority of our investment in infrastructure occurred in the last 40 years.
 
As required by the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA has established maximum contaminant levels for various substances found in drinking water to ensure that the water is safe for human consumption.  These limits are known as Maximum Contaminant Levels and Maximum Residual Disinfection Levels.  The EPA also regulates how often public water systems monitor their water for contaminants and report the monitoring results to the individual state agencies or the EPA.  Generally, the larger the population served by a water system, the more frequent the monitoring and reporting requirements.  The Safe Drinking Water Act applies to all 50 states.  The EPA has recently proposed regulatory actions  addressing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, including rules to confront PFAS contamination nationwide, with potentially significant implications.  The EPA issued a proposal to designate two of the most widely used PFAS as hazardous substances.  The EPA has also declared drinking water health advisories levels for PFAS.
 
The Lead and Copper Rule, or LCR, is a United States federal regulation that limits the concentration of lead and copper allowed in public drinking water at the consumer's tap, in addition to limiting the permissible amount of pipe corrosion occurring due to the water itself.  The EPA first issued the rule in 1991 pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act.  The EPA promulgated the regulations following studies that concluded that copper and lead adversely affect an individual’s physical and mental health.  The LCR sought to therefore limit the levels of these metals in water by improving water treatment centers, determining copper and lead levels for customers who use lead plumbing parts, and eliminating the water source as a source of lead and copper.  If the lead and copper levels exceed the "action levels", water suppliers are required to educate their consumers on how to reduce exposure to lead.  The EPA published a revised LCR in 2021, with a compliance deadline expected in 2024.  These revised requirements provide greater and more effective protection of public health by reducing exposure to lead and copper in drinking water. Implementation of the revised rule will better identify high levels of lead, improve the reliability of lead tap sampling results, strengthen corrosion control treatment requirements, expand consumer awareness and improve risk communication.  In addition, implementation of the revised rule will accelerate lead service line replacements by closing existing regulatory loopholes, propelling early action, and strengthening replacement requirements.  We are fully compliant with the current LCR and are actively examining the revised LCR to ensure we are fully compliant on or before the compliance deadline date, which is expected to be in October 2024.
 
The DPH has set maximum contaminant levels for certain substances that are more restrictive than the maximum contaminant levels set by the EPA.  The DPH is the EPA's agent for enforcing the Safe Drinking Water Act in Delaware and, in that capacity, monitors the activities of Artesian Water and reviews the results of water quality tests performed by Artesian Water for adherence to applicable regulations.  Artesian Water is also subject to other laws regulating substances and contaminants in water, including rules for volatile organic compounds and the Total Coliform Rule.
 
A normal by-product of our iron removal treatment facilities is a solid consisting of the iron removed from untreated groundwater plus residue from chemicals used in the treatment process.  The solids produced at our facilities are either disposed directly into approved wastewater facilities or removed from our facilities by a licensed third-party vendor.  A normal by-product of our carbon adsorption filtration process is exhausted carbon media, which is disposed of by the contractor providing the media replacement.  Management believes that the costs of compliance with existing federal, state and local laws and regulations regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has had no material adverse effect upon the business and affairs of the Company, but there is no assurance that such compliance costs will continue to not have a material effect in the future.
 
Under Delaware state laws and regulations, we are required to file applications with DNREC for water allocation permits for each of our operating wells pumping greater than 50,000 gallons per day.  For any wells in the Delaware River Basin, we must also file allocation permits with the Delaware River Basin Commission, or DRBC.  We have 138 operating and 63 observation and monitoring wells in our Delaware systems.  At December 31, 2022, we had allocation permits for 115 wells, and 23 wells that did not require a permit.
 
Our access to aquifers within our service territory is not exclusive.  Water allocation permits control the amount of water that can be drawn from water resources and are granted with specific restrictions on water level draw down limits, annual, monthly and daily pumpage limits, and well field allocation pumpage limits.  We are also subject to water allocation regulations that control the amount of water that we can draw from water sources.  As a result, if new or more restrictive water allocation regulations are imposed, they could have an adverse effect on our ability to supply the demands of our customers, and in turn, our water supply revenues and results of operations.  Our ability to supply the demands of our customers historically has not been affected by private usage of the aquifers by landowners or the limits imposed by the State of Delaware. Because of the extensive regulatory requirements relating to the withdrawal of any significant amounts of water from the aquifers, we believe that third-party usage of the aquifers within our service territory will not interfere with our ability to meet the present and future demands of our customers.

The MDE ensures that water quality and quantity at all public water systems in Maryland meet the needs of the public and are in compliance with federal and state regulations. The MDE also ensures that public drinking water systems provide safe and adequate water to all current and future users in Maryland, and that appropriate usage, planning, and conservation policies are implemented for Maryland’s water resources. The MDE oversees the development of Source Water Assessments for water supplies and issues water appropriation permits for public drinking water systems.  In order to appropriate water for municipal, commercial, industrial or other non-domestic uses, a Water Appropriation Permit must be obtained.  Issuance of the permit involves evaluating the needs of the user and the potential impact of the withdrawal on neighboring users and the water source in order to maximize beneficial use of the water.  Permits for large appropriations often involve conducting pump tests to measure adequacy of an aquifer and safe yield of a well, or reviewing stream flow records to determine the adequacy of a surface water source.  Regulations require all new community water systems to have sufficient technical, managerial and financial capacity to provide safe drinking water to their consumers prior to being issued a construction permit.  Also, capacity management guidance contains capacity limiting factors that can include source capacity, treatment capacity and appropriation permit quantity.  The quantity of water withdrawn from the Port Deposit surface water intake is allocated by the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, or SRBC, and the MDE.  We have 14 operating wells and one surface water in-take in our Maryland systems.
 
The Clean Water Act has established the foundation for wastewater discharge control in the United States.  The Clean Water Act established a control program for ensuring that communities have clean water by regulating the release of contaminants into waterways.  Permits that limit the amounts of pollutants discharged are required of all wastewater dischargers under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or the NPDES, permit program.  In accordance with the NPDES permit program, the implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Discharges that exceed the limits specified under the NPDES permit program can lead to the imposition of penalties.  The Clean Water Act also requires that wastewater treatment plant discharges meet a minimum of secondary treatment.  The secondary treatment process can remove 90% to 99% of the organic matter in wastewater.  Our removal efficiency is generally 96% to 98%.
 
Under Delaware state laws and regulations, we are required to hold a permit from DNREC for the construction, operation, maintenance or repair of any on-site wastewater treatment and disposal systems with daily design flow rates of 2,500 gallons or greater.  A classification on the facility is performed in accordance with Regulations Licensing Operators of Wastewater Facilities.  The class of operator required for the facility is determined by the Board of Certification for Licensed Wastewater Operations in accordance with Regulations Licensing Operators of Wastewater Facilities.  We work to ensure that we operate environmentally friendly wastewater systems that meet federal, state and local laws.
 

Additional General Information
 
Seasonality
 
Substantially all of our water customers are metered, which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water consumption.  Demand for water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months primarily due to additional customer requirements for water in connection with cooling systems, swimming pools, irrigation systems and other outside water use.  Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand for water will vary with temperature and rainfall.  In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than expected, or there is more rainfall than expected, the demand for water may decrease and our revenues may be adversely affected.
Competition
 
Our business in our franchised service areas is substantially free from direct competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other entities.  However, our ability to provide additional water and wastewater services is subject to competition from other public utilities, municipalities and other entities.  Even though our regulated subsidiaries have been granted an exclusive franchise for each of our existing community water and wastewater systems, our ability to expand service areas can be affected by the DEPSC, the MDPSC or the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, or PAPUC, awarding franchises to other regulated water or wastewater utilities with whom we compete for such franchises.
Materials and Supplies
 
We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials and parts from our suppliers for expansion, construction and maintenance of our services.  The majority of the materials required for our water and wastewater utility business are typically under contract at fixed prices, however, supply chain issues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, compounded by increasing inflation, resulted in price increases and  delays in procuring certain materials and equipment.  We have been successful in minimizing these delays and cost increases with thorough planning and pre-ordering, however there is no assurance that our future financial results or business operations will not be negatively affected.
   9




Suppliers and Independent Contractors
 
We are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and independent contractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs.  While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance review system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or independent contractors to meet commitments could adversely affect construction and maintenance schedules.  The remaining effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have delayed some of our construction projects and our lead time for material deliveries however, those delays have not impacted our ability to maintain our level of service to customers.  We are also dependent on the availability of electricity and purchased water at affordable prices.  Our electric costs and purchased water costs are at a fixed price under contract.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 252 full-time employees.  Of these employees, 54 were officers and managers; 120 were employed as operations personnel, including engineers, technicians, draftsman, maintenance and repair persons, meter readers and utility personnel; and 45 were employed in accounting, budgeting, information systems, human resources, customer relations and public relations.  The remaining 33 employees were administrative personnel.  The Company has no collective bargaining agreements with any of its employees, and its work force is not union organized or union represented.  We believe that our relations with our employees are good. Through ongoing employee development, competitive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety and employee wellbeing, we strive to help our employees in all aspects of their lives.
 
We believe the Company’s success depends on its ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel.  We provide our employees with resources that contribute to their professional development, including technical training and performance reviews.  A core principle of our company is to promote from within and offer advancement opportunities at all levels of employment, which helps us retain talented employees.  We believe our management team has the experience, talent and dedication necessary to effectively execute our business goals and growth strategy.  We recognize that the skills, experience, diversity, industry knowledge and dedication of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance.
 
We set pay ranges based on market data. When considering compensation, we consider factors such as an employee’s role, experience, and his or her performance.  We regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our compensation is fair and equitable.
 
Health and safety in the workplace for our employees is one of the Company’s core values.  Hazards in the workplace are proactively identified and actions are taken to maintain workplace safety.  We sponsor a wellness program designed to enhance physical, financial, and mental wellbeing for all our employees.  Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors through regular communications, educational sessions and other incentives.  The COVID-19 pandemic further emphasized the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy.  In response to the pandemic, the Company took actions to help protect our employees so that they could continue to perform their work in a safe and effective manner.
 
We use outside consultants and independent contractors on an as needed basis for various services.  We rely on our independent contractors to manage their respective employee relations so that the services they are contractually obligated to perform for us satisfy our requirements.  Management believes that through our own employees, coupled with the services provided by our independent contractors and outside consultants, we have sufficient human capital to continue to operate our business successfully.
