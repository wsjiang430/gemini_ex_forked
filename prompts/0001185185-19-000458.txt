ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
Pacific Health Care Organization, Inc. (the “Company”) is a specialty workers’ compensation managed care company providing a range of services principally to California employers and claims administrators.  The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Utah in April 1970, under the name Clear Air, Inc.  The Company changed its name to Pacific Health Care Organization, Inc., in January 2001.  In February 2001, the Company acquired Medex Healthcare, Inc. (“Medex”), a California corporation organized in March 1994, in a share for share exchange.  Medex is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Medex is in the business of managing and administering both Health Care Organizations (“HCOs”) and Managed Provider Networks (“MPNs”) in the state of California.  In August 2001, we formed Industrial Resolutions Coalition, Inc. (“IRC”), a California corporation, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of PHCO.  IRC oversees and manages the Company’s Workers’ Compensation Carve-Outs services. In June 2010, the Company acquired Medex Legal Support, Inc. (“MLS”), a Nevada corporation incorporated in September 2009.  MLS offers lien representation services and Medicare Set Aside (“MSA”) services.  In February 2012, we incorporated Medex Medical Management, Inc., (“MMM”) in the state of Nevada, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  MMM is responsible for overseeing and managing medical case management services. In March 2011, we incorporated Medex Managed Care, Inc. (“MMC”) in the state of Nevada, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  MMC oversees and manages the Company’s utilization review and managed bill review services. In October 2018, the Company incorporated Pacific Medical Holding Company, Inc. (“PMHC”) to act as a holding company for future potential acquisitions.
 

Company History
 
Pacific Health Care Organization, Inc. is a Utah corporation incorporated in 1970.  In 2001 PHCO acquired Medex Healthcare, Inc. and subsequently established several other operating subsidiary companies to create a workers’ compensation managed-care company that offers an integrated and layered array of complimentary business solutions that enable our clients to better manage their employee worker compensation related healthcare administration costs. In 2018, the Company established Pacific Medical Holding Company, Inc. with the intent that it be used as a holding company if the Company is successful in identifying a suitable insurance carrier acquisition target and completes such an acquisition.
 
Our clients include self-administered employers, insurers, third party administrators, municipalities and others. Our principal clients are located in the State of California where the high cost of workers’ compensation insurance is a critical problem for employers.  We have processed medical bill reviews in 25 states. Our provider networks are composed of experts in treating worker injuries. 
 
Business of the Company
 
We are workers’ compensation cost containment specialists.  Our business objective is to deliver value to our clients that reduces their workers’ compensation related medical claims expense in a manner that will assure that injured employees receive high quality healthcare that allows them to recover from injury and return to gainful employment without undue delay.  According to studies conducted by auditing bodies on behalf of the California Division of Workers’ Compensation, (“DWC”) the two most significant cost drivers for workers’ compensation are claims frequency and medical treatment costs.

Our core service focuses on the reduction of medical treatment costs by enabling our client/employers to share the control over the medical treatment process.  This control is obtained by participation in one of our medical treatment networks.  We hold several valuable government-issued licenses to operate medical treatment networks.  Through Medex we hold two of the total of nine licenses issued by the State of California to establish and manage a Health Care Organization (“HCO”) within the state of California. We also hold approvals issued by the State of California to act as a Medical Provider Network (“MPN”).  Our HCO and MPN programs provide our client/employers with provider networks within which the client/employer has some ability to direct the administration of the claim.  This is designed to decrease the incidence of fraudulent claims and disability awards and ensure injured employees receive the necessary back-to-work rehabilitation and training they need.  We also offer medical case management, formerly called nurse case management, program that keeps medical treatment claims progressing to a resolution and assures treatment plans are aligned from a medical perspective.  Nurse oversight is a collaborative process that assesses plans, implements, coordinates, monitors and evaluates the options and services required to meet an injured worker’s health needs.
 
Health Care Organizations
 
An HCO is a network of health care professionals specializing in the treatment of workplace injuries and in back-to-work rehabilitation and training of our clients’ employees.  HCOs were created to appeal to injured workers, while providing substantial savings to the client/employers.  In most cases, our HCO programs gives the client/employer 180 days of medical control in a provider network within which the client/employer can direct the administration of the claim.  The injured worker may change physicians once during this period, but the worker may not leave the provider network.  The increased length of time during which the client/employer has control over administration of the claim is designed to decrease the incidence of fraudulent claims and disability awards.  The right to control treatment within a network is also based upon the notion that if there is more control over medical treatment there will be more control over getting injured workers healthy and back on the job.  An outcome would be to control total claim treatment cost and related workers’ compensation insurance premiums.
 
Our HCO licenses allow us to cover the entire state of California.  Our clients can offer their injured workers a choice of enrolling in an HCO with a network managed by primary care providers which requires primary care physicians to make referrals to needed specialists or in an HCO where injured workers do not need any prior authorization to be seen and treated by specialists.
 
Our HCO networks have contracted with approximately 3,900 individual medical providers and clinics, as well as hospitals, pharmacies, rehabilitation centers and other ancillary services enabling our HCOs to provide comprehensive medical services throughout California.  Our provider networks are composed of experts in treating worker injuries.  We are continually reviewing and enhancing these networks based upon the nominations of new clients and the approvals of their claims administrators.  All network provider credentials are reviewed and approved by our subsidiary Medex.
 
HCO guidelines impose certain medical oversight, reporting, information delivery and usage fees upon HCOs.  These requirements increase the administrative costs and obligations on HCOs over those applicable to an MPN, although the obligations and cost differentials between the two types of organizations have been narrowing over the past few years.
 
Medical Provider Networks
 
Like an HCO, an MPN is a network of health care professionals, but MPN networks do not require the same level of medical expertise in treating work place injuries.  Under an MPN program the client/employer dictates which physician the injured employee will see for the initial visit.  Thereafter, the MPN program grants the employee discretion to choose which physician in the network will continue treatment of the claim; the client/employer is benefited by having that discretion limited for the life of the claim to physicians within the MPN network.  In addition, the California MPN statute and regulations allow the injured employee to dispute treatment decisions, provide for second and third medical opinions, and then permits case review by an independent medical reviewer, whose decision can result in the client/employer losing control over medical treatment of the employee.
 
Unlike our HCOs, our MPN does not require our clients to pay annual fee assessments, nor does it require our clients to comply with annual enrollment notice delivery requirements.  As a result, there are fewer administrative costs associated with an MPN program, which allows our MPN to market its services at a lower cost to employers than our HCOs.  For this reason, many clients may opt to use the less complicated MPN even though it provides client/employers fewer rights to control medical treatment of employee injury claims.

HCO + MPN
 
As a licensed HCO and approved MPN, in addition to offering HCO and MPN programs, we are also able to offer our client/employers a combination of the HCO and MPN programs.  Under this plan model a client/employer can enroll its employees in the HCO program, and then prior to the expiration of the 180-day treatment period under the HCO program, the client/employer can enroll the employee into the MPN program.  This allows client/employers to take advantage of both programs.  To our knowledge, PHCO is currently the only entity that offers clients/employers and HCO+MPN combination program.
Medical Case Management
 
Medical case management, formerly called nurse case management, keeps medical treatment claims progressing to a resolution and assures treatment plans are aligned from a medical perspective.  Medical oversight is a collaborative process that assesses plans, implements, coordinates, monitors and evaluates the options and services required to meet an injured worker’s health needs.  Medical case managers act as a liaison between the injured worker, claims adjuster, medical providers and attorneys to achieve optimal results for injured workers and employer/clients.
 
Our credentialed nurses have expertise in various clinical areas and extensive backgrounds in workers’ compensation matters.  This combination allows our nurses the opportunity to facilitate medical treatment while understanding the nuances of workers’ compensation up to and including litigation.  By providing these services our client/employers contribute to effective delivery of medical treatment assuring the injured worker receives quality treatment in a timely and appropriate manner to return the worker to employment.
 
Workers’ Compensation Carve-outs
 
Some employers can opt out of the standard workers’ compensation regulatory scheme through carve-out agreements that comply with state law requirements.  We facilitate the negotiation of legal agreements for the implementation of Workers’ Compensation Carve-Outs for California client/employers and provide services to the carve-out agreement parties.  Under such carve-out agreements certain clients can access our HCOs, MPN and medical case management program.
 
California law permits employers and employees to establish alternative dispute resolution systems to resolve disputes in the workers’ compensation context.   These arrangements are called carve-outs because the employers and employees covered by such agreements are carved out from the standard state workers’ compensation scheme, provided applicable statutory and regulatory requirements covering the administration of carve-out programs are met.  These carve-out agreements are made between client/employers and the collective bargaining units representing covered client employees.  
 
Ancillary Services
 
Beyond the core services we provide to facilitate client/employers involvement in employee medical treatment claims administration and patient treatment options, we also provide to our HCO and MPN clients several claims-related services that bring efficiencies to claim processing and management that further reduce the overall burden of workers’ compensation claims resolution.  These services include various back office type functions that assure cost efficiency and accuracy in claim processing, claim reimbursement and claim dispute resolution.
 
All our services are fully integrated to allow for partial and full bundling of services and sharing of information across all our platforms.  Our bundled services have allowed some client/employers to achieve up to a 70% reduction in the cost of injury claim resolution while maintaining superior treatment for injured workers. Seamless integration between services enhances cost-savings by providing concurrent access to complete, accurate and timely information relating to our HCOs, MPNs or PPO networks and all our ancillary services as claims are managed to completion.  Among such services are:
 
Utilization Review
 
Using skilled staff and an automated review system, we deliver utilization review services to self-insured clients, insurance companies and public entities. Utilization review is designed to evaluate the medical necessity of proposed treatment by comparing medical records against accepted medical guidelines. Its purpose is to serve as a safeguard against liability for medical costs that are not medically appropriate or approved by the relevant medical and legal authorities and the payor. Reviews are conducted at the appropriate qualification level for the request and the proposed determination, and within the timelines set by the relevant regulations. The Company complies and participates with regulatory audits of Utilization Review Organizations, and in accordance with some state laws, maintains a full accreditation by URAC.

Medical Bill Review
 
We provide professional analysis of medical provider services and equipment billing to ascertain proper reimbursement.  Such services include, but are not limited to, coding review and re-bundling, confirming that the services are customary and reasonable, fee schedule compliance, out-of-network bill review, pharmacy review, and preferred provider organization repricing arrangements.  These services can result in significant network savings. 
Lien Representation Services
 
When a worker is injured in the scope of employment the client/employer is required to provide workers’ compensation benefits.  If the provider of services is not paid because the services were not authorized, or if the provider disputes the amount of reimbursement, the provider may file a lien against the workers’ compensation claim.  We provide comprehensive lien representation services from negotiation through litigation and petitions for reconsideration.  
Legal Support Services
 
We provide expert witness testimony before the California Workers Compensation Appeals Board.  The fees include reimbursement of witness fees, travel and lodging expenses.
 
Medicare Set-aside Fees
 
We provide Medicare set-aside services for workers’ compensation claims which is a financial agreement that allocates a portion of a workers’ compensation settlement to pay for future medical services related to the work-place injury, illness, or disease.  The purpose of the set-aside arrangement is to provide funds to the injured party to pay for future medical expenses that would otherwise be covered by Medicare.  This program affords our client/employers an effective way to overcome complications after settlement and avoids unnecessary costs attached to the claim.
Marketing and Customers
 
We provide services to virtually any size employer in the state of California as well as insurers, third party administrators, self-administered employers, municipalities and other industries.  We also provide some client/employers utilization review, medical case management and medical provider network, medical bill review, network access fee services and Medicare set-aside services outside the state of California.
 
Marketing and sales are achieved at multiple levels from client referrals, conference presentations, responding to RFPs, and advertisement. We service both local and national accounts, however, with an emphasis on California focused markets. Our sales and marketing activities are conducted by account managers with the assistance of our executive team members.
 
During 2018, Preferred Operator Group, LLC (POG) and Hilton Worldwide accounted for approximately 28% and 12% respectively, of our total sales. 
 
Competition
 
We were one of the first commercial enterprises capable of offering HCO services and MPN services in California.  Now there are many companies who compete in this market.  Many of these competitors are larger than PHCO and may have greater financial, research and marketing experience and resources than we do, and they may therefore represent substantial long-term competition.  As of December 31, 2018, in California there were nine certified health care organization licenses issued to seven companies. We own two of the nine licenses and have six possible direct HCO competitors.  Only two of these HCO competitors, however, are currently writing HCO business due to the complexity of the HCO regulations.  There are minimal requirements for establishing MPNs and therefore, as of December 31, 2018, there were 2,432 active MPNs in the State of California according to the DWC MPN website.  Of these, we have received approval for and administer 33 MPNs.

We compete on both quality of service delivery and price of services.  We maintain quality of service by virtue of the training, skill and experience of our professional staff and numerous outside consultants. We compete on price through our integrated and robust information technology systems.  We focus our business primarily to those employers and payers who use our HCO and/or MPN services.  We anticipate that this focus will keep most of this business stable and renewable.  However, periodically we expect that some large clients may establish the in-house capability of performing the services we offer, as this has occurred in the past.  If we are unable to compete effectively, it will be difficult for us to retain current customers or add new customers, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
 
We rely on our well-trained and knowledgeable in-house professionals to develop service offerings aligned with market need.  We target the needs of insurers, third party administrators and self-administered employers. We contract directly with medical providers based on quality determinations rather than the provision of discounted medical services. We believe this provides us a competitive advantage because we can market a direct relationship with providers who have demonstrated expertise in treating work related injuries and writing credible medical reports rather than relying on third party relationships or discounts alone.
 
We offer both HCO and MPN programs to potential clients, as well as an HCO/MPN combination model, which we believe also gives us a competitive advantage, because of the way the network was created.  While some of our competitors offer either HCO or MPN services, to our knowledge, none of our competitors offer this type of HCO/MPN combination model, nor, in our opinion, do they have the legal and medical expertise to administer one.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Managed care programs for workers’ compensation are subject to various laws and regulations.  The nature and degree of applicable regulation varies by state and by the specific services provided.  Parties that provide or arrange for the provision of healthcare services are subject to numerous complex regulatory requirements that govern many aspects of their conduct and operations.  
 
Because managed healthcare is a rapidly changing and expanding industry and the cost of providing healthcare continues to increase, it is possible that the applicable federal and state regulatory frameworks will expand to have a greater impact upon the conduct and operation of our business.
 
As discussed above, the provision of workers’ compensation managed care in the state of California is governed by legislation and secondary regulations.  We are required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval to operate our networks in California. California and other jurisdictions require individuals who engage in claim adjusting and certain other insurance service activities to be personally licensed. In many jurisdictions, licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities.
 
The services we provide have developed largely in response to legislation or other governmental action.   Changes in the legislation regulating workers’ compensation may create greater or lesser demand for the services we offer or require us to develop new or modified services to meet the needs of the marketplace and compete effectively.  We could also be materially and adversely affected if the state of California were to elect to reduce the extent of medical cost containment strategies available to insurance companies and other payers or adopt other strategies for cost containment that would not support demand for our services. In order to obviate such possibilities as much as possible, we have engaged a California-based lobbyist with expertise in workers’ compensation. When there is proposed legislation in California, even in the discussion stage, that might affect our business, we are immediately notified and are often included as stakeholders for preliminary discussions.
 
There has been considerable discussion of healthcare reform at both the federal and state level in recent years.  Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and the timing of their enactment, we cannot predict which, if any, reforms will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on our business or within the industry in which we participate.  It is current thinking that it is doubtful that any such healthcare reform would significantly impact workers’ compensation, which is primarily a disability program, not medical.

Employees
 
Including the employees of our subsidiaries, as of March 28, 2019 we employed 38 full-time employees.  We also use the services of several consultants.  Over the next twelve months, we anticipate hiring additional employees only if business revenues increase and our operating requirements warrant such hiring.
