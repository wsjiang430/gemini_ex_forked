Corporate History
 
We began operating as an independent company on July 1, 2015 (the “Separation Date”) after separating from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (“DuPont”) (the “Separation”). The Separation was completed pursuant to a separation agreement and other agreements with DuPont, including an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, a transition services agreement, and an intellectual property cross-license agreement. These agreements govern the relationship between us and DuPont following the Separation and provided for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights, and obligations at the Separation Date. On August 31, 2017, DuPont completed a merger with The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”), pursuant to which, Dow and DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont, Inc. with the intent to form three independent, publicly-traded companies. At this time, the agreements related to our Separation remain between us and DuPont.

Fluoroproducts Segment
 
Segment Overview
 
Our Fluoroproducts segment is a global leader in providing fluorine-based, advanced materials solutions, such as refrigerants and industrial resins and derivatives. The segment creates products that have unique properties, such as high temperature resistance, high chemical resistance, and unique di-electric properties, for applications across a broad array of industries and applications. The manufacturing of fluoroproducts involves complex processes that include the use of highly corrosive and hazardous intermediates. We have an industry-leading safety culture and apply world-class R&D and technical expertise to ensure that our operations run safely and reliably, and to improve our process technology. We sell fluoroproducts through two primary product groups: Fluorochemicals and Fluoropolymers.
 
Fluorochemicals products include refrigerants, industrial coolers, air conditioning, foam blowing agents, propellants, and fire suppression products. We have held a leading position in the fluorochemicals market since the commercial introduction of Freon™ in 1930. Since the original chlorofluorocarbons (“CFC”)-based product was introduced, we have been at the forefront of new technology research for lower GWP and lesser ozone-depleting potential products, leading to the development of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (“HCFC”) and hydrofluorocarbons (“HFC”). We have a leading position in HFC refrigerants under the brand name Freon™, and we are a leader in the development of sustainable technologies like Opteon™, a line of low GWP hydrofluoroolefin (“HFO”) refrigerants, which also have a zero ozone-depletion footprint. Opteon™ was initially developed in response to the European Union’s (“EU”) Mobile Air Conditioning Directive. Today, our OpteonTM-branded portfolio of products are used in a broad range of applications, including automotive, air conditioning, commercial refrigeration, and foam blowing agents. This patented technology offers similar functionality to current HFC products, but meets or exceeds currently-mandated environmental standards and, in some cases, provides energy efficiency benefits. 
 
We led the industry in the Montreal Protocol-driven transition in 1987 from CFCs to the lesser ozone-depleting HCFCs and non-ozone-depleting HFCs. In 1988, we committed to cease production of CFCs and started manufacturing non-ozone-depleting HFCs in the early 1990s. Driven by new and emerging environmental legislation, and standards currently being implemented across the U.S., Europe, Latin America, and Japan, we have commercialized Opteon™. Over the years, regulations have pushed the industry to evolve and respond to environmental concerns. We will continue to invest in R&D to remain a leader and meet our customers’ needs as regulations change.

Industry Overview and Competitors
 
Our Fluoroproducts segment competes against a broad variety of global manufacturers, as well as regional Chinese and Indian manufacturers. We have a leadership position in fluorine chemistry and materials science, a broad scope and scale of operations, market-driven applications development, and deep customer knowledge. Key competitors in Fluorochemicals include: Honeywell International, Inc., Arkema S.A., Mexichem S.A.B. de C.V., Dongyue Group Co., Ltd. (“Dongyue”), and Juhua Group Corporation. Key competitors in Fluoropolymers include: Daikin Industries, Ltd., 3M Company, Solvay, S.A., Asashi Glass Co., Ltd., Dongyue, and Chenguang Group. 
 
Fluoroproducts demand growth is generally in line with global gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth. Within Fluorochemicals, growth may be higher than GDP in situations where, for environmental reasons, regulatory drivers constrain the market or drive the market toward lower GWP alternatives. In Fluoropolymers, overall market growth is expected to be in line with GDP over the next few years, but may be influenced by increased competition and pricing pressure in some businesses. There are certain emerging technologies, along with our focus on application development, that may drive our growth at a rate faster than GDP. Developed markets represent the largest consumers of fluoroproducts today. Global middle class growth and the increasing demand for expanding infrastructure, alternative energy, consumer electronics, telecommunications, automobiles, refrigeration, and air conditioning are all key drivers of increased demand for various fluoroproducts.
 
Raw Materials
 
The primary raw materials required to support the Fluoroproducts segment are fluorspar, chlorinated organics, chlorinated inorganics, hydrofluoric acid, and vinylidene fluoride. These are available in many countries and are not concentrated in any particular region. Our supply chains are designed for maximum competitiveness through favorable sourcing of key raw materials. Our contracts typically include terms that span from two to 10 years, except for select resale purchases that are negotiated on a monthly basis. Most qualified fluorspar sources have fixed contract prices or freely-negotiated, market-based pricing. Although the fluoroproducts industry has historically relied primarily on fluorspar exports from China, we have diversified our sourcing through multiple geographic regions and suppliers to ensure a stable and cost competitive supply. Our current supply agreements are generally in effect for the next five years.
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
 
With more than 85 years of innovation and development in fluorine science, our technical, marketing, and sales teams around the world have deep expertise in our products and their end-uses. We work with customers to select the appropriate fluoroproducts to meet their technical performance needs. We sell our products through direct channels and through resellers. Selling agreements vary by product line and markets served and include both spot-pricing arrangements and contracts with a typical duration of one year.
 
We maintain a large fleet of railcars, tank trucks, and containers to deliver our products and support our supply chain needs. For the portion of the fleet that is leased, the related lease terms are usually staggered, which provides us with a competitive cost position, as well as the ability to adjust the size of our fleet in response to changes in market conditions. A dedicated logistics team, along with external partners, continually optimizes the assignment of our transportation equipment to product lines and geographic regions in order to maximize utilization and flexibility of the supply chain.
 
Customers
 
The Fluoroproducts segment serves approximately 2,600 customers and distributors globally and, in many instances, these commercial relationships have been in place for decades. No single Fluoroproducts customer represented more than 10% of the segment’s net sales in 2018.

The Chemours Company
 
Seasonality
 
Fluorochemicals’ refrigerant sales fluctuate by season as sales in the first half of the year are generally higher than sales in the second half of the year due to increased demand for residential, commercial, and automotive air conditioning in the spring, which peaks in the summer months, and then declines in the fall and winter. Mobile air conditioning demand is slightly higher in the first half of the year due to the timing of automotive production shutdowns in the second half of the year. There is no significant seasonality for Fluoropolymers, as demand is relatively consistent throughout the year.
Chemical Solutions Segment
 
Segment Overview
 
Our Chemical Solutions segment comprises a portfolio of industrial chemical businesses, primarily operating in the Americas. The segment’s products are used as important raw materials and catalysts for a diverse group of industries including, among others, gold production, oil and gas, water treatment, electronics, and automotive.

Titanium Technologies Segment 
 
Segment Overview
 
Our Titanium Technologies segment is a leading, global manufacturer of high-quality TiO2 pigment. TiO2 pigment is used to deliver whiteness, brightness, opacity, and ultra-violet light protection in applications such as architectural and industrial coatings, flexible and rigid plastic packaging, polyvinylchloride (“PVC”) window profiles, laminate papers used for furniture and building materials, coated paper, and coated paperboard used for packaging. We sell our TiO2 pigment under the Ti-Pure™ brand name. We also sell a chloride-based TiO2 pigment under the BaiMaxTM brand name, which is exclusively produced for customers in Greater China. We operate four TiO2 pigment production facilities: two in the U.S., one in Mexico, and one in Taiwan. In addition, we have a large-scale repackaging and distribution facility in Belgium and operate a mineral sands mining operation in Starke, Florida and surrounding areas. In total, we have a TiO2 pigment capacity of approximately 1.25 million metric tons per year.
 
We are one of a limited number of manufacturers operating a chloride process for the production of TiO2 pigment. We believe that our proprietary chloride technology enables us to operate plants at a much higher capacity than other chloride technology-based TiO2 pigment producers, as we uniquely utilize a broad spectrum of titanium-bearing ore feedstocks to achieve one of the highest TiO2 pigment unit margins in our industry. This technology, which is in use at all of our production facilities, provides us with one of the industry’s lowest manufacturing cost positions. Our R&D efforts focus on improving production processes and developing TiO2 pigment grades that help our customers achieve optimal cost and product performance to enhance end-user total value.
 
We sell over 20 different grades of TiO2 pigment, with each grade tailored for targeted applications. Our portfolio of premium performance TiO2 pigment grades provides end-users with benefits beyond opacity, such as longer-lasting performance, brighter colors, and the brilliant whites achievable only through chloride-manufactured pigment.
 
We have operated a titanium mine in Starke, Florida since 1949. The mine provides us with access to a low-cost source of domestic, high-quality ilmenite ore feedstock and supplies less than 10% of our ore feedstock consumption needs. Co-products of our mining operations, which comprised less than 5% of our total net sales in Titanium Technologies during 2018, are zircon (zirconium silicate) and staurolite minerals. We are a major supplier of high-quality calcined zircon in North America, primarily focused on the precision investment casting industry, foundry, specialty applications, and ceramics. Our staurolite blasting abrasives are used in steel preparation and maintenance and paint removal.
 
Industry Overview and Competitors
 
The overall demand for TiO2 pigment is highly correlated to growth in the global residential housing, commercial construction, and packaging markets. In the long-run, industry demand for TiO2 pigment is generally expected to grow proportionate to GDP growth. We continue to experience customers’ preference for high-quality Ti-PureTM offerings. After two years of demand in the TiO2 pigment market above GDP growth, in 2018, the TiO2 pigment market contracted below the GDP trend. In the longer-term, we expect global TiO2 pigment demand to resume its historical correlation with global GDP growth rates.

 7

The Chemours Company
 
We estimate that the worldwide demand for TiO2 pigment in 2018 was approximately 5.9 million metric tons, of which, approximately 60% was for premium performance pigments. Worldwide nameplate capacity in 2018 was estimated to be approximately 7.5 million metric tons. The products manufactured on this global capacity base are not fully substitutable due to pigment quality consistency and pigment product design. We believe that the utilization of the premium performance manufacturing base is considerably higher than that for general purpose, lower-performance production. Over the next few years, we are planning to incrementally increase our production capacity by approximately 10% through technology-enabled de-bottlenecking processes. We believe that unlocking this additional 10% of capacity is in line with the anticipated needs of our customers during this time. This new capacity is expected to provide the equivalent of a new production line, while requiring a fraction of the capital investment. Our increased production capacity will be supported by investments to extend our ilmenite mine and through long-term contracts with our suppliers.
 
Competition in the TiO2 pigment market is based primarily on product performance (both product design and quality consistency), supply capability, price, and technical service. Our major competitors within higher-performance pigments include: The National Titanium Dioxide Company, Ltd., or “Cristal”, Venator Materials plc, Kronos Worldwide, Inc., and Tronox Limited. Beyond multi-national suppliers, the only other large producer of TiO2 pigment is the Chinese producer, the Lomon-Billions Group. The other TiO2 pigment producers are fragmented, mostly utilizing the sulfate production process, and competing in the general purpose, lower-performance pigment market. Over the next few years, we believe that the announced added effective capacity in China is expected to be somewhat offset by capacity shutdowns at marginal producers. 
 
Raw Materials
 
The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of TiO2 pigment are titanium-bearing ores, chlorine, calcined petroleum coke, and energy. We source titanium-bearing ores from a number of suppliers around the globe, who are primarily located in Australia and Africa. To ensure proper supply volume and to minimize pricing volatility, we generally enter into contracts in which volume is requirement-based and pricing is determined by a range of mechanisms structured to help us achieve competitive cost. We typically enter into a combination of long-term and medium-term supply contracts and source our raw materials from multiple suppliers across different regions and from multiple sites per supplier. Furthermore, we typically purchase multiple grades of ore from each supplier to limit our exposure to any single supplier for any single grade of ore in any given time period. Historically, we have not experienced any problems renewing such contracts for raw materials or securing our supply of titanium-bearing ores.
 
We play an active role in ore source development around the globe, especially for those ores which can only be used by us, given the capability of our unique process technology. Supply chain flexibility allows for ore purchase and use optimization to manage short-term demand fluctuations and provides long-term competitive advantage. Our process technology and ability to use lower-grade ilmenite ore gives us the flexibility to alter our ore mix to low-cost configuration based on sales, demand, and projected ore pricing. Lastly, we have taken steps to optimize routes for distribution and increase storage capacity at our production facilities.
 
Transporting chlorine, one of our primary raw materials, can be costly. To reduce our need to transport chlorine, we have a chlor-alkali production facility run by a third-party that is co-located at our New Johnsonville, Tennessee site. Calcined petroleum coke is an important raw material input to our process. We source calcined petroleum coke from well-established suppliers in North America and China, typically under contracts that run multiple years to facilitate materials and logistics planning through the supply chain. Distribution efficiency is enhanced through the use of bulk ocean, barge, and rail transportation modes. Energy is another key input cost in the TiO2 pigment manufacturing process, representing approximately 12% of the production cost. We have access to natural gas-based energy at our U.S. and Mexico TiO2 pigment production facilities and our Florida minerals plant, supporting advantaged energy costs given the low cost of shale gas in the U.S. 
 
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
 
We sell the majority of our products through a direct sales force. We also utilize third-party sales agents and distributors to expand our reach. TiO2 pigment represents a significant raw material cost for our direct customers, and as a result, purchasing decisions are often made by our customers’ senior management teams. TiO2 pigment, however, is only a small fraction of the cost when considering certain end-use applications, especially in segments with larger value chain players, such as specialty coatings, plastics, and laminates applications. Our sales organization works to develop and maintain close relationships with key decision-makers in our value chain. In addition to close purchasing relationships, our sales and technical service teams work together to develop relationships with all layers of our customers’ organizations to ensure that we meet our customers’ commercial and technical requirements. When appropriate, we collaborate closely with customers to solve formulation or application problems by modifying product characteristics or developing new product grades.
 
To ensure an efficient distribution, we have a large fleet of railcars, which are predominantly used for outbound distribution of products in the U.S. and Canada. A dedicated logistics team, along with external partners, continually optimizes the assignment of our transportation equipment to product lines and geographic regions in order to maximize utilization and maintain an efficient supply chain.

The Chemours Company
 
Customers
 
Globally, we serve approximately 600 customers through our Titanium Technologies segment. In 2018, our 10 largest Titanium Technologies customers accounted for approximately 35% of the segment’s net sales, and one Titanium Technologies customer represented more than 10% of the segment’s net sales. Our larger customers in the U.S. and Europe are typically served through direct sales and tend to have medium-term to long-term contracts. We serve our small-size and mid-size customers through a combination of our direct sales and distribution network. Our direct customers in the Titanium Technologies segment are producers of decorative coatings, automotive and industrial coatings, polyolefin masterbatches, PVC window profiles, engineering polymers, laminate paper, coatings paper, and coated paperboard. We focus on developing long-term partnerships with key market participants in each of these sectors. We also deliver a high level of technical service to satisfy our customers’ specific needs, which helps us maintain strong customer relationships.
Seasonality
 
The demand for TiO2 pigment is subject to seasonality due to the influence of weather conditions and holiday seasons on some of our applications, such as decorative coatings. As a result, our TiO2 pigment sales volume is typically lowest in the first quarter, highest in the second and third quarters, and moderate in the fourth quarter. This pattern applies to the entire TiO2 pigment market, but may vary by region, country, or application. It can also be altered by economic or other demand cycles.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual property, including trade secrets, certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, and other proprietary rights, is a critical part of maintaining our technology leadership and competitive edge. Our business strategy is to file patent and trademark applications globally for proprietary new product and applications development technologies. We hold many patents, particularly in our Fluoroproducts segment, as described herein. These patents, including various patents that will expire from 2019 through 2034, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance to our business. However, we believe that no single patent (or related group of patents) is material in relation to our business as a whole. Our Chemical Solutions segment is a manufacturing and application development technology leader in a majority of the markets in which it participates. Trade secrets are one of the key elements of our intellectual property security in the Chemical Solutions segment, as most of the segment’s manufacturing and applications development technologies are no longer under patent coverage. In addition, particularly in our Titanium Technologies segment, we hold significant intellectual property in the form of trade secrets, and, while we believe that no single trade secret is material in relation to our combined business as a whole, we believe that our trade secrets are material in the aggregate. Unlike patents, trade secrets do not have a pre-determined validity period, but are valid indefinitely, so long as their secrecy is maintained. We work actively on a global basis to create, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights. The protection afforded by these patents and trademarks varies based on country, scope of individual patent, and trademark coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country. Although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we do not believe that we are materially-dependent on any particular patent or trademark. We believe that securing our intellectual property is critical to maintaining our technology leadership and our competitive position, especially with respect to new technologies or the extensions of existing technologies. Our proprietary process technology can be a source of incremental income through licensing arrangements.
 
Our Fluoroproducts segment is a technology leader in the markets in which it participates. We have one of the largest patent portfolios in the fluorine derivatives industry. In our Fluoroproducts segment’s intellectual property portfolio, we consider our Freon™, Opteon™, Teflon™, Viton™, NafionTM, and Krytox™ trademarks to be valuable assets. Our Titanium Technologies segment in particular relies upon unpatented proprietary knowledge, continuing technological innovation, and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position in this sector. Our proprietary chloride production process is an important part of our technology, and our business could be harmed if our trade secrets are not maintained in confidence. In our Titanium Technologies segment’s intellectual property portfolio, we consider our trademarks Ti-Pure™ and BaiMaxTM to be valuable assets and have registered the Ti-PureTM trademark in a number of countries and the BaiMaxTM trademark in China.
 
At the Separation, certain of our subsidiaries entered into an intellectual property cross-license agreement with DuPont, pursuant to which (i) DuPont has agreed to license to us certain patents, know-how, and technical information owned by DuPont or its affiliates which are necessary or useful in our business, and (ii) we have agreed to license to DuPont certain patents owned by us or our affiliates which are necessary or useful in DuPont’s business. In most circumstances, the licenses are perpetual, irrevocable, sub-licensable (in connection with the party’s business), assignable (in connection with a sale of the applicable portion of a party’s business or assets, subject to certain exceptions) worldwide licenses in connection with the current operations of the businesses and, with respect to specified products and fields of use, future operations of such businesses, subject to certain limitations with respect to specified products and fields of use.

Backlog
 
In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders and do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of our future sales activity. Our production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of net sales or financial performance.
