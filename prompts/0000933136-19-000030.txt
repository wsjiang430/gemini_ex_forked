Item 1. Business
The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by Item 1A. Risk Factors and the section captioned “Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 1. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report. 
OVERVIEW
Mr. Cooper Group Inc., including our consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, “Mr. Cooper”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), earns fees through the delivery of servicing, origination and transaction based services related primarily to single-family residences throughout the United States. 
Mr. Cooper, which was previously known as WMIH Corp. (“WMIH”), is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware since May 11, 2015. On July 31, 2018, Wand Merger Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMIH (“Merger Sub”), merged with and into Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. (“Nationstar”), with Nationstar continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMIH (the “Merger”). Prior to the Merger, WMIH had limited operations other than its reinsurance business that operated in runoff mode and focused on identifying and consummating an accretive acquisition transaction across a broad array of industries, with a primary focus on the financial institutions sector. As a result of the Merger, shares of Nationstar common stock were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Following the Merger closing, the combined company traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “WMIH” until October 10, 2018, when WMIH changed its name to “Mr. Cooper Group Inc.” and its ticker symbol to “COOP.” 
We are one of the largest residential loan servicers in the United States. In addition, we operate an integrated residential loan origination platform with a primary focus on customer retention and an array of complementary services related to the purchase and disposition of residential real estate. 
Our success ultimately depends on working with customers, investors and regulators to deliver quality, compliant solutions that foster and preserve home ownership. Customers include most residential real estate market participants including homeowners, homebuyers, home sellers, investors and real estate agents. Investors primarily include government sponsored entities (“GSE”) such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae” or “FNMA”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (“Freddie Mac” or “FHLMC”), investors in private-label securitizations, the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae” or “GNMA”), as well as organizations owning mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) which engage us to subservice. We are regulated both at the Federal and individual state levels. 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We conduct our operations through three operating segments: Servicing, Originations and Xome®.
“Predecessor” financial information in the Business Segments relates to Nationstar, and “Successor” financial information relates to Mr. Cooper. The financial results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 reflect the results of the Predecessor entity for that time period. With respect to the year ended December 31, 2018, we have presented our results on a “combined” basis by combining the results of the Predecessor for the seven months ended July 31, 2018 with the results of the Successor for the five months ended December 31, 2018. Although the separate financial results of the Predecessor for the seven months ended July 31, 2018 and the Successor for the five months ended December 31, 2018 are each separately presented under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States, the combined results reported reflect non-GAAP financial measures, because a different basis of accounting was used with respect to the financial results for the Predecessor as compared to the financial results of the Successor. We have not provided a reconciliation of the financial metrics reflected under the “combined” basis as such reconciliation cannot be provided without unreasonable effort as a result of this accounting variance.
Servicing
As of December 31, 2018, we served approximately 3.3 million customers with an aggregate unpaid principal balance (“UPB”) of approximately $548 billion. We are the largest non-bank servicer and third largest residential mortgage servicer in the United States according to Inside Mortgage Finance in the fourth quarter of 2018. During 2018, on a combined basis, we boarded $121 billion UPB of loans with $60 billion of UPB related to subservicing. 
We service loans on behalf of investors or owners of the underlying mortgages, and because we do not generally hold loans for investment purposes, our loss exposure is limited to investor guidelines regarding the servicing of delinquent loans. We have exposure to credit risk to the extent we are required to make servicing advances or in certain circumstances, with Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) or Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) loans. Servicing consists of collecting loan payments, remitting principal and interest payments to investors, managing escrow funds for the payment of mortgage-related expenses, such as taxes and insurance, performing loss mitigation activities on behalf of investors and otherwise administering our mortgage loan servicing portfolio.
The chart below sets forth the portfolio mix between serviced, subserviced and reverse loans as of December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.
Forward servicing
We own the right to service loans owned by investors, which typically result from bulk acquisitions, flow agreements, or the sale and securitization of loans we originate. Where we own the right to service loans, we recognize an MSR asset in our consolidated financial statements and have elected to mark this portfolio to fair value each quarter. Servicing activities for owned MSRs include the collection and recording of mortgage payments, the administration of mortgage escrow accounts, negotiations of workouts and modifications and, if necessary, conducting or managing the foreclosure (real estate owned or “REO”) on behalf of investors or other servicers. We primarily generate recurring revenue through contractual fees earned from our MSRs, which are a stated percentage of the UPB of current performing loans earning interest income on float related to collecting and remitting payments and ancillary revenues (e.g., modification fees, late fees, incentive fees). As the MSR owner, we are, in several instances, obligated to make servicing advances to fund scheduled principal, interest, tax and insurance payments when the mortgage loan borrower has failed to make the scheduled payments and to cover foreclosure costs and various other items that are required to preserve the assets being serviced. These servicer advance obligations require significant capital and liquidity in order to fund the advances until we are contractually authorized to reimburse ourselves for the advances from the loan investor.
Servicing revenues are intended to cover the costs and operating risks associated with MSR ownership, which include carrying costs associated with advances to pay taxes, insurance and foreclosure costs and also include costs incurred as a result of potential operational errors.
 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 6

Subservicing
We service loans on behalf of our clients who own the underlying servicing rights. In these cases, since we do not own the right to service the loan, we do not recognize an asset in our consolidated financial statements. We primarily generate revenue based upon a stated fee per loan that varies based on the loan’s delinquency status. Subservicing fee revenue is generally less than the servicing fee received by the owner of the MSR; however, subservicing loans reduces the interest rate exposure and related revenue volatility from MSR fair value changes and eliminates compensating interest expense and payoff-related costs. As a subservicer, we may be obligated to make servicing advances; however, advances and other incurred costs are generally lower compared to owned MSR portfolios, and recovery times are substantially faster, often within the following month. Capital requirements for subservicing arrangements are lower than for owned MSRs. Additionally, our exposure to foreclosure-related costs and losses is generally limited in our subservicing relationships as those risks are retained by the owner of the MSR.
In 2018, we continued to expand our subservicing portfolio by boarding $60 billion UPB of subservicing, which contributed approximately 50% of the total UPB boarded during 2018, on a combined basis. We believe the expansion of subservicing operations allows us to leverage the scale of our technology and labor capital to provide cost effective servicing to customers while limiting the use of cash resources, thereby producing a higher return on equity. Certain subservicing agreements also provide a flow of new loans to help replenish and grow our own serviced portfolio.
Reverse servicing
Included within owned MSRs are the rights to service reverse residential mortgage loans acquired from third parties through our Champion Mortgage® brand. Our reverse portfolio includes loans in Ginnie Mae and private-label securitizations, as well as unsecuritized reverse loans held by investors, such as Fannie Mae. A servicing fee is earned based on the stated service fee rate or net interest margin of home equity conversion mortgage (“HECM”) backed securities of the reverse portfolio. As a servicer, we are required to fund advances on the reverse loans up to the maximum claim amount. These advances include borrower draws and advances to cover taxes, insurance, mortgage insurance premiums and interest payments. Recovery of advances and collection of servicing fees generally occurs upon a transfer of ownership in the underlying collateral. Due to the structure of reverse mortgages, we securitize substantially all draws on reverse mortgage loans through the Ginnie Mae II MBS program or through private-label securitizations. Our reverse portfolio accounted for 5.2% of our total servicing UPB as of December 31, 2018.
7 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 

The majority of loans we serviced are for GSEs, followed by Ginnie Mae and private-label investors in mortgage securitization transactions. The chart below sets forth the composition of our servicing portfolio ending UPB by investor group as of December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.
Our servicing portfolio includes both conventional residential mortgage loans and home equity conversion loans, referred to as “forward” and “reverse” loans, respectively. Although we own the mortgage servicing rights for the majority of these loans, we also act as master servicer on certain portfolios and subservicer on certain portfolios for which the servicing rights are owned by a third party.
Focus on the Customer
We are focused on providing quality service to our customers and building strong, lasting relationships. For each loan we service, we utilize a customer-centric model designed to increase borrower performance and to decrease borrower delinquencies. Keys to this model include frequent borrower interactions and utilization of multiple loss mitigation strategies particularly in the early stages of default. We train our customer service representatives to find solutions that work for homeowners when circumstances allow. We believe this commitment to continued home ownership helps preserve neighborhoods and home values and improves asset performance for our investors.
We are highly experienced in loan modifications and aim to avoid foreclosures. Between 2010 and 2013, the Predecessor acquired distressed portfolios from banks who were not equipped to service such highly delinquent portfolios. The unprecedented levels of delinquencies and defaults of residential real estate loans after the financial crisis at that time required varying degrees of loss mitigation activities. We have made, and continue to make, significant efforts to help borrowers remain in their homes and view foreclosure typically as a last result. In 2018, our customer outreach initiatives resulted in 7,467 Home Affordable Refinance Program (“HARP”) refinancings and modifications, on a combined basis, resulting in cost savings to customers averaging $1,295 per year. These initiatives contributed to lower loan delinquency rates exceeding 60 days from 3.4% in 2017 to 2.2% in 2018. Our special servicing capabilities, coupled with our acquisition and transfer of conventional MSRs and subservicing, have resulted in a decline in delinquency rates in our portfolio.
 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 8

The mortgage experience is often complex, but we aim to take a leadership role in the industry by putting customers first and preserving homeownership. We have strengthened the composition of our leadership team and altered incentive programs over the past four years to emphasize the importance of teamwork, compliance and a customer-centric approach. In 2018, we launched a design thinking initiative to develop mobile-friendly solutions that reimagine the experience of homeownership for customers. 
Originations
Our Originations segment provides refinance opportunities to our existing servicing customers through our direct-to-consumer platform and purchases loans from originators through our correspondent channel. According to Inside Mortgage Finance, we were the 16th largest overall mortgage loan originator, funding $21 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, on a combined basis. We generate revenue through gain-on-sale and fees associated with originating and selling mortgage loans sourced through our direct-to-consumer and correspondent channels. We originate and purchase conventional mortgage loans conforming to the underwriting standards of the GSEs, which we collectively refer to as Agency loans. We also originate and purchase government-insured mortgage loans, which are insured by the FHA, VA and USDA. 
We believe our integrated origination platform provides us with competitive advantages, including an organic source of servicing assets at attractive returns. The platform also serves as a loss mitigation solution for servicing clients and customers by offering refinancing options to borrowers thereby allowing them to lower their monthly payments which in turn may lower their risk of defaulting. 
We utilize warehouse facilities to fund originated loans. After we sell originated mortgage loans to secondary market investors, we generally retain the servicing rights on mortgage loans sold. The mortgage loans are typically sold within 30 days of origination in order to both mitigate credit risk and minimize the capital required. The majority of our mortgage loans were sold to, or were sold pursuant to, programs sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.
We are committed to providing our customers with the tools and resources they need to be successful in today’s marketplace. We are focused on increasing conversion rates (i.e., recapture) on our existing servicing portfolio and expanding our correspondent channel through growing our third-party origination businesses. We have continued to diversify our origination business in order to be successful in multiple market scenarios by offering different products. We believe we can originate these products profitably and with acceptable levels of risk. We expect to continue to make investments towards acquiring new customers through various outbound marketing initiatives and expanding the purchase recapture business by focusing on existing customers who are looking to purchase a new home. 
9 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 

The chart below sets forth the originations funded volume for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.
Direct-to-Consumer Channel
We originate loans directly with borrowers through our direct-to-consumer channel. This channel utilizes our call centers and our originations websites to reach our existing 3.3 million servicing customers who may benefit from a new mortgage. Depending on borrower eligibility, we will refinance existing loans into conventional, government or non-Agency products. Through lead campaigns and direct marketing, the direct-to-consumer channel seeks to convert leads into loans in a cost-efficient manner. We earn an upfront fee for processing the loan application which covers the costs of securing the loan application and underwriting.
Our direct-to-consumer channel represented 48.1% of our mortgage originations for the year ended December 31, 2018, on a combined basis. The Predecessor direct-to-consumer channel represented 66.3% and 69.9% of mortgage originations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Pull through adjusted lock volume for this channel totaled $9.7 billion in 2018 on a combined basis, and $11.3 billion and $13.7 billion in 2017 and 2016 for the Predecessor, respectively.
Correspondent Channel
We purchase closed mortgage loans from community banks, credit unions, mortgage brokers and independent mortgage bankers. We primarily generate revenue from the receipt of underwriting fees from correspondents earned on a per-unit loan basis, as well as the gain on sale of loans sold into the secondary market.
Our correspondent channel represented 51.9% of our mortgage originations for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Predecessor correspondent channel represented 33.7% and 30.1% of mortgage originations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Pull through adjusted lock volume for this channel totaled $10.5 billion in 2018 on a combined basis, and $6.4 billion and $6.7 billion in 2017 and 2016 for the Predecessor, respectively.

Xome
The Xome (pronounced “Zome”) segment is a leading provider of technology and data-enhanced solutions to banks, non-banks, investment companies, and GSEs engaged in the origination, investment, and/or servicing of mortgage loans, as well as to home buyers, home sellers, real estate professionals mortgage professionals, and real estate investors. Today our business is primarily generated through clients in the mortgage refinance and servicing sectors; however, we plan to grow non-default and non-refinance transactions through a variety of strategies and offerings tailored to the needs of clients outside these core segments. 
Xome’s operations are comprised of Exchange, Services and Data/Technology.
Exchange is a national technology-enabled platform that manages and sells residential properties through our Xome.com website. This platform leverages our proprietary auction technology and was designed to increase transparency, reduce fraud risk and provide better execution for property sales as evidenced by generally higher sales price and lower average days to sell compared to traditional sales. In the last three years, on a combined basis, Xome Exchange has sold approximately 40,000 properties. Core services include traditional non-distressed sales, REO auctions, short sales and foreclosure trustee sales. 
Services connects the major touch points of the real estate transactions process by providing title, escrow, collateral valuation and field services for purchase, refinance and default transactions. We continue to serve existing third-party customers and capture refinance and default transactions generated by our Servicing and Originations segments. Over the last three years, on a combined basis, Xome Services has completed approximately 945,000 title and close orders, 809,000 collateral valuation orders and 433,000 property reports. In 2018, we acquired Assurant Mortgage Solutions, which drove significant growth in third-party revenues. 
Data/Technology contains a diversified set of businesses including Xome Analytics (primarily multiple listing service (“MLS”) data and analytics). Quantarium (artificial intelligence powered valuation and other real estate data and analytics), and Xome Signings (technology enabled notary services). Xome Analytics provides aggregation, standardization and licensing for one of the nation’s largest set of MLS, public records and neighborhood demographic data. Quantarium is an artificial intelligence company which has developed a sophisticated machine based property valuation model and built one of the largest real estate data lakes in the US. Quantarium serves clients in both the mortgage and real estate sectors. 
2019 Core Initiatives

Competition
Our Servicing segment primarily competes against large financial institutions and non-bank servicers. Some of our biggest competitors are large banks, which include Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Chase Home Finance and Bank of America. Non-bank servicers continue to play an increasingly important role in the mortgage industry, and we compete with companies such as Quicken Loans, Freedom Mortgage, Ocwen Financial Corporation, Ditech Financial and PennyMac Financial Services among others. 
The subservicing market in which we operate is also highly competitive. We compete with non-bank servicers, such as Cenlar FSB, Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc. and LoanCare, and we face competition related to subservicing pricing and service delivery. Our competitive position is also dependent on our continued ability to demonstrate compliance with local, state, federal and investor regulations or requirements and to improve technology and processes while controlling our costs to maintain competitive pricing. Finally, we manage the risk of declining subservicing units due to payoffs by entering into new arrangements and executing our portfolio retention initiatives to grow our subservicing portfolio.
11 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 

Our Originations segment competes based on product offerings, rates, fees and customer service. In recent years, more restrictive loan underwriting standards and the widespread elimination of certain non-conforming mortgage products throughout the industry have resulted in a more homogeneous product offering, which has increased competition across the industry for mortgage originations. The industry is also presented with heightened challenges and costs associated with the increasingly complex regulatory compliance environment.
Many of our Originations competitors are commercial banks or savings institutions. These financial institutions typically have access to greater financial resources, have more diverse funding sources with lower funding costs, are less reliant on the sale of mortgage loans into the secondary markets to maintain their liquidity, and may be able to participate in government programs in which we are unable to participate because we are not a state or federally chartered depository institution, all of which places us at a competitive disadvantage. 
Our primary competitive strength flows from our ability to market our products to our existing servicing portfolio. Our origination capabilities also provide a significant advantage compared to other subservicers. Our Originations segment is highly dependent on our customer relationships. Many smaller and mid-sized financial institutions may find it difficult to compete in the mortgage industry due to the significant market share of the largest competitors, along with the continual need to invest in technology in order to reduce operating costs while maintaining compliance with more restrictive underwriting standards and dynamic regulatory requirements. Our ability to win new clients and maintain existing customers is largely driven by the level of customer service we provide and our ability to comply and adapt to an increasingly complex regulatory environment.
Competitive factors in the Xome segment include the quality and timeliness of our services, the size and competence of our network of vendors, the breadth of the services we offer, the quality of the technology-based application or service and pricing. Based on our knowledge of the industry and competitors, we also believe that no single competitor offers the range of solutions we are able to offer.
The industry verticals in which the Xome segment engages are highly competitive and generally consist of a few national companies, as well as a large number of regional, local and in-house providers, resulting in a fragmented market with disparate service offerings. Our Exchange unit competes with national and regional third-party service providers and in-house servicing operations of large mortgage lenders and servicers. We also compete with companies providing online real estate auction services and real estate brokerage firms. Our Data/Technology unit competes with data processing and software development companies and in-house technology and software operations of other loan servicers. In addition, our customers retain multiple providers and continuously evaluate our performance against various other competitors.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 8,500 employees, none of which were subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our future success will depend, in part, on our continuing ability to attract, hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel.

CAUTIONS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, projections, strategies, core initiatives, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are not statements of historical facts. When used in this discussion, the words “anticipate,” “appears,” “believe,” “foresee,” “intend,” “should,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “plan,” “may,” “could,” “will,” “are likely” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements involve predictions of our future financial condition, performance, plans and strategies, and are thus dependent on a number of factors including, without limitation, assumptions and data that may be imprecise or incorrect. Specific factors that may impact performance or other predictions of future actions have, in many but not all cases, been identified in connection with specific forward-looking statements. As with any projection or forecast, forward-looking statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances, and we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
A number of important factors exist that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to:

• | our ability to maintain or grow the size of our servicing portfolio;


• | our ability to maintain or grow our originations volume;


• | our ability to recapture voluntary prepayments related to our existing servicing portfolio;


• | our shift in the mix of our servicing portfolio to subservicing, which is highly concentrated;


• | delays in our ability to collect or be reimbursed for servicing advances;


• | our ability to obtain sufficient liquidity and capital to operate our business;


• | changes in prevailing interest rates;


• | our ability to finance and recover costs of our reverse servicing operations;


• | our ability to successfully implement our strategic initiatives;


• | our ability to realize anticipated benefits of the Merger and other acquisitions, including Assurant;


• | our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes;


• | changes in our business relationships or changes in servicing guidelines with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae;


• | Xome’s ability to compete in highly competitive markets;


• | our ability to pay down debt;


• | our ability to manage legal and regulatory examinations and enforcement investigations and proceedings, compliance requirements and related costs;


• | our ability to prevent cyber intrusions and mitigate cyber risks; and


• | our ability to maintain our licenses and other regulatory approvals

All of these factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and may be beyond our control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all such factors or to assess the effect of each such new factor on our business. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and any of these statements included herein may prove to be inaccurate. Given the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or our objectives and plans will be achieved. Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of this report for further information on these and other factors affecting our business.
