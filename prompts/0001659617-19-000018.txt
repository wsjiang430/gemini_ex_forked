ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
Moleculin Biotech, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of highly resistant cancers. We have three core technologies, all of which are based on discoveries made at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center ("MD Anderson"). We have three drugs in four clinical trials in the US and Poland. Our clinical stage drugs are Annamycin, believed by management to be a “Next Generation” Anthracycline, being studied for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and WP1066, an Immune/Transcription Modulator targeting brain tumors, pancreatic cancer and AML. Additionally, a third drug, WP1220 (a molecule similar to WP1066), was approved for a clinical trial in January 2019 in Poland for the topical treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. We are also engaged in preclinical development of additional drug candidates, including additional Immune/Transcription Modulators, as well as Metabolism/Glycosylation Inhibitors. 
We believe that our Next Generation Anthracycline, Annamycin, is unlike any currently approved anthracyclines, as it is designed to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms with little to no cardiotoxicity – hence the use of the term “Next Generation.” Annamycin has preliminary clinical data suggesting its potential to become the first successful therapy suitable for the majority of relapsed or refractory AML patients and is currently in two Phase I/II clinical trials.
WP1066 is one of several Immune/Transcription Modulators designed to stimulate the immune response to tumors by inhibiting the errant activity of Regulatory T-Cells (TRegs) while also inhibiting key oncogenic transcription factors, including p-STAT3, c-Myc and HIF-1α. These transcription factors are widely sought targets that may also play a role in the inability of immune checkpoint inhibitors to affect more resistant tumors.
We are also developing new compounds designed to exploit the potential uses of inhibitors of glycolysis such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose (“2-DG”), which we believe may provide an opportunity to cut off the fuel supply of tumors by taking advantage of their high level of dependence on glucose in comparison to healthy cells. A key drawback to 2-DG is its lack of drug-like properties, including a short circulation time and poor tissue/organ distribution characteristics. Our lead Metabolism/Glycosylation Inhibitor, WP1122, is a prodrug of 2-DG that appears to improve the drug-like properties of 2-DG by increasing its circulation time and improving tissue/organ distribution. New research also points to the potential for 2-DG to be capable of enhancing the usefulness of checkpoint inhibitors. Considering that 2-DG lacks sufficient drug-like properties to be practical in a clinical setting, we believe WP1122 may also become an important drug to potentiate checkpoint inhibitors. 
Mission and Strategy
Moleculin is focused on developing treatments for highly resistant cancers. These include AML, glioblastoma, cutaneous t-cell lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, and others. Our diverse pipeline of technologies was built around the recognition that many highly resistant tumors tend to have a common set of traits, including an increase in multidrug resistant mechanisms, an evasion of the natural immune system, a marked upregulation of certain key oncogenic transcription factors and an increased dependence on glycolysis for energy production. We believe each of these elements may be addressed by the unique and innovative mechanisms introduced by one or more of our three core technologies.
We believe this approach not only provides the opportunity to help the many patients in need of alternative therapies, but also to work in combination with numerous existing technologies that often fail as tumors present immediate or acquired resistance. We believe showing even modest improvements in highly resistant cancers may lead to accelerated approval pathways, potentially reducing the time and capital required to ultimately realize success.
Corporate Overview
We were founded in 2015 in order to combine and consolidate the development efforts involving several oncology technologies, based on license agreements with MD Anderson. This effort began with the acquisition of the Annamycin development project from AnnaMed, Inc., or AnnaMed, followed by the acquisition of the license rights to the WP1122 Portfolio from IntertechBio Corporation, or IntertechBio. Further, on behalf of Moleculin, LLC, we entered into a co-development agreement with Houston Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or HPI, which culminated with the merger of Moleculin, LLC into MBI coincident with our initial public offering allowing us to gain control of the WP1066 Portfolio.
Moleculin, LLC was formed in 2006 and was working to develop the WP1066 Portfolio it licensed from MD Anderson. On May 2, 2016, Moleculin, LLC was merged with and into MBI. As a result of the merger, we issued the holders of Moleculin, LLC equity interests and convertible notes representing in the aggregate approximately 999,931 shares of our common stock. Since Moleculin, LLC commenced operations in 2006, substantially all of its efforts had been focused on research, development and the advancement of the WP1066 Portfolio. Moleculin, LLC did not generate any revenue from product sales and, as a result, incurred significant losses.
In June 2018, we formed Moleculin Australia Pty. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary to oversee pre-clinical development in Australia. The Australian government provides an aggressive incentive for research and development carried out in their country. We believe having an Australian subsidiary could provide a great opportunity to speed up pre-clinical development and reduce the overall cost of our continued drug development efforts.
We do not have manufacturing facilities and all manufacturing activities are contracted out to third parties. Additionally, we do not have a sales organization.
Technology Overview
We have been granted royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive licenses for the patent and technology rights related to all of our drug technologies, as these patent rights are owned by MD Anderson. The Annamycin drug substance is no longer covered by any existing patent protection, but we intend to submit patent applications for formulation, synthetic process and reconstitution related to our Annamycin drug product candidate, although there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such patent protection. Independently from potential patent protection, we have received Orphan Drug designation (“ODD”) from the FDA for Annamycin for the treatment of AML and, subsequent to December 31, 2018, we received ODD for WP1066 for the treatment of glioblastoma. If we receive approval for either product for the orphan use, we may obtain market exclusivity of 7 years from the date of approval of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) in the United States. During that period FDA generally could not approve another product with the same active moiety for the same use. We also intend to apply for similar status in the European Union (“EU”) where market exclusivity extends to 10 years from the date of Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”). Separately, the FDA may also grant market exclusivity of 5 years for newly approved new chemical entities (of which Annamycin would be one), but there can be no assurance that such exclusivity will be granted.
Next Generation Anthracycline
Chemotherapy continues to be a cornerstone of cancer therapy. Despite the progress made with immunotherapy and precision medicine, the first-line treatment for many cancers continues to include chemotherapy. And, in part because of the emphasis placed on alternatives to chemotherapy, we believe that not enough has been done to improve chemotherapeutic agents to make them safer and more effective. Anthracyclines are a class of chemotherapy drugs designed to destroy the DNA of targeted cancer cells. Acute leukemia is one of a number of cancers that are usually treated with anthracyclines. In the case of acute leukemia, anthracyclines are typically used in “induction therapy,” where the goal is to induce sufficient remission of patients’ blood-born tumor cells to allow for a curative bone marrow transplant. 
Two key factors limit the safety and effectiveness of anthracyclines: cardiotoxicity (potential to damage the heart) and multidrug resistance. We believe Annamycin may overcome these two factors; if preliminary data are borne out, Annamycin may ultimately provide clinically meaningful benefits over currently approved anthracyclines in treating certain cancers. Preliminary data from very early-stage clinical trials suggest acute leukemia as a potentially opportune indication in which to further study Annamycin.
One of the key dose-limiting toxicities associated with currently available anthracyclines (including the anthracycline in the recently approved drug, Vyxeos) is the propensity to induce life-threatening heart damage (also known as cardiotoxity). This is a particularly significant risk for pediatric leukemia patients, whose life spans can be severely shortened by the induction therapy intended to cure them of acute leukemia. In the animal model recommended by the FDA as an indicator of human cardiotoxicity, the non-liposomal (free) form of Annamycin has been shown to be significantly less likely than doxorubicin to create heart lesions in mice, and the liposomal formulation (L-Annamycin) has been shown in these same models to have reduced cardiotoxicity to the point where it is unlikely to cause harm to human patients. If this characteristic is shown to be the same in humans, it may allow L-Annamycin to be used more aggressively to help patients achieve remission. This would be especially valuable in the case of pediatric acute leukemia (both AML and ALL) because of the potential impact of cardiotoxicity on long-term survival. In our current Phase I/II trial for Annamycin, we are collecting data to further validate the design intent of Annamycin to have little or no cardiotoxicity. Unless otherwise noted, all of our references to Annamycin refer to the liposomal form (L-Annamycin).
In addition, the effectiveness of currently approved anthracyclines is limited by their propensity for succumbing to “multidrug resistance.” This can occur where, as a natural defense mechanism, transmembrane proteins acting as transporters (one type of which is referred to as a “P-glycoprotein pump” or “ABCB1 transporter”) develop on the outer surface of cells to expel perceived threats like anthracyclines. In many instances, the likelihood of cardiotoxicity (and other serious side effects) prevents increasing the dosing of current therapies in order to overcome multidrug resistance. As a result, most patients cannot receive current anthracyclines in doses that are adequate to produce lasting remission and thereby qualify for a bone marrow transplant. A laboratory study has suggested that Annamycin may resist being expelled by P-glycoprotein pumps and similar multidrug resistance transporters, which may mean the drug circumvents multidrug resistance. This characteristic has been shown in pre-clinical testing to allow for higher drug uptake in diseased cells, which we believe could allow for more effective induction therapy with less risk to the patient. 
Immune/Transcription Modulators: Enabling Immune Response and Inhibiting p-STAT3 and other Oncogenic Transcription Factors – 
We believe our WP1066 Portfolio (including lead drugs WP1066, WP1220 and WP1732) represents a novel class of agents capable of hitting multiple targets, including the activated form of a key oncogenic transcription factor, STAT3. A substantial body of published research has identified STAT3 as a master regulator of a wide range of tumors and has linked the activated form, p-STAT3, with the survival and progression of these tumors. For this reason, it is widely believed that targeted inhibition of p-STAT3 may be an effective way to reduce or eliminate the progression of these diseases. 
The high level of anticancer activity demonstrated in multiple tumors in animal models by WP1066 and WP1732 is potentially related to their ability to also inhibit such important key oncogenic transcription factors like c-Myc and HIF-1α. In addition to direct anticancer effects not related to the function of the immune system, our lead drug WP1066 has also been shown to boost immune response in animals, in part by inhibiting activity of Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are coopted by tumors to evade the immune system. We believe the dual effect of (1) directly inhibiting tumor growth and inducing tumor cell death and (2) separately boosting and directing the natural immune response to tumors is therapeutically highly promising. If additional preclinical and clinical data validate the two avenues of apparent activity, this class of drugs may be well-suited to treat a wide range of tumors, both as single agents and as critical elements of successful combination therapies targeting even some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers.
The recent oncology drug landscape has been dominated by immunotherapy, specifically including checkpoint inhibitors. In just the last 5 years, checkpoint inhibitors (such as Opdivo and Keytruda) have reached over $10 billion in annual revenues. To summarize checkpoint blockade therapy, the T-Cells within an individual’s own immune systems should be capable of identifying tumor cells and destroying them before they destroy the individual. Unfortunately, tumors develop the ability to prevent this natural immune response by regulating the expression of certain receptors referred to as “immune checkpoints” that then bind to T-Cells and prevent them from attacking the tumor. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are antibodies that block these receptor mechanisms and allow the T-Cells to act normally and attack the tumor. 
In certain types of tumors, like melanoma, checkpoint inhibitors work well and the results can be impressive, creating durable suppression of tumors where no other therapy had succeeded. However, despite the outstanding results in select patients, checkpoint inhibitors benefit only a limited number of patients in certain cancers, and they are essentially not effective in what are called “non-responsive” tumors like glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer, among others. As a result, companies are now focusing heavily on combination therapies, combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy, as well as other agents. There appears to be tremendous demand and we believe there is a clear need for new chemotherapeutic agents that, by their specific mechanism of action, would produce potent combination effects with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and that additionally can boost immune system response on their own. In this regard, there is early nonclinical evidence that WP1066, as a single agent, has the ability to reverse immune tolerance in brain tumor patients (Cancer Res, 67(20), 9630, 2007), and preliminary data in animal models that suggests WP1066 may have a potential for combination use with checkpoint inhibitors.
Recently published research papers have presented several findings that may point to major new opportunities for Moleculin’s WP1066 class of drugs. One such article suggested that our STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 abrogated PD-L1/2 expression in cancer cells and may be a useful agent in addition to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in cancer patients (J Clin Exp Hematop, 57(1), 21-25, 2017). Other published results show that CTLA4-induced immune suppression occurs primarily via an intrinsic STAT3 pathway, suggesting that, through its inhibition of activated STAT3, WP1066 might work well in combination with this checkpoint inhibitor (Cancer Res, 77(18), 5118–28, 2017).
A separate paper presents selected key transcription factors as being responsible for the upregulation of an often-targeted checkpoint actor in tumors known as PD-L1. Some of the most important transcription factors identified were HIF-1α, c-Myc and STAT3, the very targets for which WP1066 was designed (Front Pharmacol, 2018 May 22, 9:536, doi: 10.3389/ fphar.2018.00536, eCollection 2018). In summary, although much of the data is nonclinical and all of it is preliminary, we are
 optimistic that administration of WP1066 could lead to improved treatment results in many patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
Metabolism/Glycosylation Inhibitors: Using the Warburg Effect to Starve Tumor Cells to Death –
        Science has recognized that many types of cancer cells have a unique metabolism, distinct from that of normal cells. Cancer cells’ dependence on glycolysis (a specific way of converting glucose into energy) to proliferate and metastasize has been described as the “sweet tooth of cancer” and is a classic example of how the metabolism of cancer cells and normal cells differ. Glycolysis is a glucose-intensive means of producing energy that is used by normal cells only if oxygen levels are low. However, many types of tumor cells are essentially addicted to glycolysis even in the presence of abundant oxygen. This is known as the “Warburg Effect” after its discoverer, Dr. Otto Warburg, and such tumors are said to be highly “glycolytic.” 
This phenomenon of tumors relying preferentially on glycolysis and the resulting dramatic increase of glucose uptake to fulfill their metabolic demands has already been utilized very effectively in cancer diagnostics. It is the Warburg Effect that enables imaging of actively growing tumors by positron emission tomography (“PET scans”). This diagnostic test uses a fluorine-18 radiolabeled glucose decoy called F18DG that accumulates disproportionately in tumors, using the same process that increases glucose uptake and retention in cancer cells.
The success of PET scanning points to the potential therapeutic benefit of the tumor-specific inhibition of glycolysis that would block energy (adenosine triphosphate (“ATP”)) production and could potentially “starve tumor cells to death” and/or make them sensitive to other existing therapies, including radiotherapy. Unsuccessful attempts to realize this therapeutic potential have been made in the past, using a glucose decoy known as “2-deoxy-D-glucose” (2-DG). Those attempts to target the metabolism of tumor cells have failed, we believe, because of 2-DG’s lack of drug-like properties that include rapid metabolism, short half-life and limited tissue-organ distribution. Essentially, not enough 2-DG could be delivered to its intended target.
We have designed and are studying a novel and patented prodrug of 2-DG (WP1122). We believe WP1122 has the potential for developing into a technology platform for enabling increased cellular uptake, increased drug half-life and, importantly, enabling greater uptake and retention in organs where the most resistant and glycolytic tumors are localized, including the brain and pancreas.
Altering Glycosylation to Enhance Immune Checkpoint Therapy – 
A recently published study (Am J Cancer Res, 8(9), 1837-1846, 2018) focused on the analysis of tumor resistance to immune checkpoint therapy. The study found that a process known as glycosylation plays an important role in the ability of checkpoint receptors to suppress immune activity and thereby protect tumors from attack. The researchers discovered that an alteration of the glycosylation of these receptor mechanisms could effectively prevent this evasion of the immune system. This study found that 2-deoxyglucose, or 2-DG, was capable of making this alteration. Although the data are preliminary, the findings suggest that 2-DG could act as an effective anticancer agent in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and potentially with other anticancer therapies.
Attempting to use 2-DG as a drug, however, faces the same problems discussed above. 2-DG’s short circulation time and lack of other drug-like properties mean the drug does not stay in the system long enough or concentrate sufficiently in targeted organs, which severely limits its effectiveness. This suggests a possible role for our patented drug candidate, WP1122. WP1122 is a prodrug of 2-DG, meaning it is a molecule that may be able to be converted into pharmacologically active 2-DG within the body of the patient. The design of WP1122 is intended to allow for a longer circulation time and improved organ distribution, which should provide it a greater opportunity to become an effective drug. 
We intend to study WP1122 for both its ability to directly inhibit tumor activity and to potentiate existing therapies via an inhibition of tumor metabolism and to improve the performance of checkpoint inhibitors by reducing the effect of glycosylation and have begun the necessary preclinical work required to file an IND.
Clinical Activity
Annamycin had previously been in clinical trials with a prior drug developer pursuant to an application for Investigational New Drug status (“IND”) that had been filed with the FDA. Due to a lack of development activity by the prior drug developer, this IND was terminated. To permit the renewed investigation of Annamycin, we submitted a new IND for a Phase I/II trial for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML in August 2017, which was subsequently allowed by the FDA in September 2017. Patient treatment began in the US in March 2018. We are in the first cohort in our Phase I portion of the trial.
With regard to additional potential Annamycin clinical activity, we received Polish National Office approval in June 2018 for a Clinical Trial authorization (“CTA”) in Poland, which enables us to begin a Phase I/II clinical trial there to study Annamycin for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. In Poland, while the clinical trial and the first site were approved in June 2018, we were required to obtain final approval by two different authorities - one in Europe and one in Poland – to ship Annamycin drug product to Poland. Such approval is not necessary for use of Annamycin drug product in the US and we have Annamycin drug product ready and available in the US to treat potential patients. For Poland, we obtained the necessary approvals in November and December 2018 and shipped Annamycin drug product in late December 2018. In January 2019, we began screening patients in Poland. 
We continue to recruit and contract with clinics both in the United States and Poland. We can provide no assurance of additional recruitment or that treatments will occur in the near term and on a timely basis, if at all. 
A physician-sponsored IND for a Phase I trial of WP1066 in patients with recurrent malignant glioma and brain metastasis from melanoma was allowed by the FDA in December 2017. In July 2018, this trial opened for recruitment in the US. This trial is now in its third cohort of the Phase I portion of the planned protocol. Because this trial is physician led, we are limited in our ability to manage the trial. 
With regard to additional potential clinical activity on other drugs, in September 2017 we engaged a CRO to prepare for a proof-of-concept clinical trial in Poland to study our drug candidate WP1220, a part of the WP1066 portfolio, for the topical treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”). In 2018, we filed a CTA in Poland for this trial, which was approved in January 2019, giving us a third drug in clinic and our fourth clinical trial. 
On May 1, 2018, we engaged another CRO to evaluate additional countries for the expansion of our AML clinical trial, specifically Australia and several Western European countries to provide additional clinical sites to improve access for patients to our Phase I/II trial.
We have begun planning and performing the necessary pre-clinical work required to submit an IND for WP1732 and WP1122. In June 2018, we entered into an agreement with The University of Iowa Pharmaceuticals for the development of a formulation for WP1732. This agreement marked the beginning of creating a preclinical package to submit to the FDA in order to request Investigational New Drug status. We have now completed formulation development, and our IND-enabling toxicology work will be progressing via our Australian subsidiary, Moleculin Australia, and we expect to submit an IND in the US in 2019.
We also continue to sponsor ongoing research at MD Anderson in order to improve and expand our drug development pipeline.
Our Drug Candidates
Annamycin
One of our lead product candidates is Annamycin, for which FDA has allowed an IND for a Phase I/II trial for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML and granted Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of AML. We are conducting Phase I/II clinical trials for Annamycin as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML in the United States and in Poland.
We took over the development of Annamycin from a prior drug development company that ceased development work on Annamycin because it believed the clinical data did not support further clinical evaluation of L-Annamycin as a single agent to treat relapsed or refractory adult acute leukemia patients, leading to the termination of its IND by the FDA. The basis for our decision to proceed notwithstanding the prior developer’s determination is that we believe the actual clinical data as reported by Dr. Robert Shepard, our Chief Medical Officer and who was the prior developer’s Chief Medical Officer at the time of the clinical trials, to the 2009 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and as further reported by the Principal Investigators of the clinical trials in a peer-reviewed journal article (Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2013 August; 13(4): 430-434. doi:10.1016/j.clml.2013.03.015.), supports further clinical evaluation. In addition, the conclusion published in the 2013 Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma & Leukemia Journal article was that “Single agent nanomolecular liposomal annamycin appears to be well-tolerated and (demonstrates) evidence of clinical activity as a single agent in refractory adult ALL.” As reported in both the ASCO presentation and the 2013 journal article referenced, the definition of efficacy is based on the following Response Criteria: “Response criteria were achievement of CR defined as ≤5% blasts, granulocyte count of ≥1×109/L, and a platelet count of ≥100×109/L. Partial remission was defined the same as CR, except for the presence of 6% to 25% blasts. Hematologic improvement was defined as for CR but platelet count &lt;100×109/L.” The summary of patient response from the 2013 journal article reads: “After determining the MTD, a 10-patient phase IIA was conducted. Eight of the patients completed one cycle of the three days of treatment at the MTD. Of these, five (62%) demonstrated encouraging anti
-leukemic activity with complete clearing of circulating peripheral blasts. Three of these subjects also cleared bone marrow blasts with one subsequently proceeding onto successful stem cell transplantation. The other two developed tumor lysis syndrome and unfortunately expired prior to response assessment.” In our review of these trials, we confirmed that the activity demonstrated in this summary corresponds with a “Partial remission” as described in the Response Criteria and that the three subjects who “cleared bone marrow blasts” correspond with “CR” (Complete Response).
The Dose Limiting Toxicities (“DLTs”) reported in the previous trial that led to the establishment of the current MTD of 150 mg/m2 were all from patients who had an unusually high number of induction therapy failures prior to being treated with Annamycin. Specifically, of the three patients in the last clinical trial who experienced these DLTs, one of them had failed nineteen prior induction therapy attempts, another had failed sixteen and the other had failed fifteen before being enrolled in the trial. We believe from our review of this data that, if the heavily treated patients are excluded from the data set, the MTD may have been higher than the level that was actually set by this previous trial. With the discovery that we may be able to increase our MTD, we adjusted our clinical strategy by adding in a Phase I arm to our trial, which will add expense to our development effort. We believe this change in strategy will add several months to the eventual final approval of the drug, if the drug is approved.
Market for Annamycin
Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells and acute forms of leukemia can manifest quickly and leave patients with limited treatment options. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. It occurs when a clone of leukemic progenitor white blood cells proliferates in the bone marrow, suppressing the production of normal blood cells. Currently, the only viable option for acute leukemia patients is a bone marrow transplant, also known as a hematopoietic stem cell transplant or “HSCT”, which is successful in a significant number of patients. However, in order to qualify for a bone marrow transplant, the patient’s leukemia cells must be decreased to a sufficiently low level. This usually begins with a therapy referred to as “7+3,” which consisted of combining seven injections of Cytarbine with 3 infusions of an anthracycline to induce remission (a complete response, or “CR”). This therapy had not improved since it was first used in the 1970s and we estimate that this induction therapy had a success rate of about 20% to 25%. A revision to this therapy was recently approved in the form of a drug called Vyxeos, which involves combining Cytarabine and an anthracycline (daunorubicin) into a single liposomal injection given 3 times. This improvement appears to have increased the level of CRs to 34% and the overall survival by 3.5 months. Unfortunately, the current clinically approved anthracyclines (including Vyxeos) are cardiotoxic (i.e., can damage the heart), which can limit the dosage amount that may be administered to patients. Additionally, the tumor cells often present de novo or develop resistance to the first line anthracycline, through what is called “multidrug resistance,” enabling the tumor cells to purge themselves of the available anthracyclines. Consequently, there remains no effective therapy for inducing remission in the majority of these patients sufficient to enable a curative bone marrow transplant and unfortunately most will succumb quickly to their leukemia. If a patient’s leukemia reappears before they can be prepared for a bone marrow transplant, they are considered to have “relapsed.” If a patient fails to achieve a sufficient response from the induction therapy to qualify for a bone marrow transplant, they are considered to be “refractory” (resistant to therapy). Together, this group of relapsed and refractory AML patients constitutes our primary focus for treatment with Annamycin and our intent is to pursue FDA approval for Annamycin as a second-line induction therapy for adult relapsed or refractory AML patients.
We believe that pursuing approval as a second line induction therapy for adult relapsed or refractory AML patients is the shortest path to regulatory approval, but we also believe that one of the most important potential uses of Annamycin is in the treatment of children with either AML or ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is more common in children). Accordingly, we also intend to pursue approval for pediatric use in these conditions when practicable. 
Clinical Trials for Annamycin
Because the prior developer of Annamycin allowed their IND to lapse, we were required to submit a new IND for continued clinical trials with Annamycin. We filed our IND application for Annamycin, with the clinical strategy of increasing the MTD mentioned above, in February 2017. In subsequent discussions with us, FDA requested certain revisions to the protocol, additional information, and additional data related to Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”). We made the requested revisions to the protocol, and included the CMC data in our re-submission of the IND in August 2017 and the FDA allowed this IND in September 2017. Patient treatment began in the US in March 2018. We are in the first cohort in our Phase I portion of the trial.
With regard to additional potential Annamycin clinical activity, in August 2017, we met with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) to discuss a CTA in Europe for the study of Annamycin for the treatment of AML. As a result of that meeting, we decided to proceed with an application in October 2017 for a CTA for Annamycin in Poland. Unlike in the United States, the process for beginning a clinical trial in Poland requires a hospital contract before a request for CTA can be made. We obtained the required hospital contract, which allowed the formal request for Polish approval. In December 2017, the Ethics Committee
 in Poland approved our Phase I/II trial of Annamycin for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. A final approval is required by the Polish National Office which was received.
We received Polish National Office approval in June 2018 for a CTA in Poland, which enables us to begin a Phase I/II clinical trial there to study Annamycin for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. In Poland, while the clinical trial and the first site were approved in June 2018, we were required to obtain final approval by two different authorities - one in Europe and one in Poland – to ship Annamycin drug product to Poland. Such approval is not necessary for use of Annamycin drug product in the US and we have Annamycin drug product ready and available in the US to treat potential patients. We obtained the necessary approvals in November and December 2018 and shipped Annamycin drug product in December 2018. In early 2019 we began screening new patients in Poland. 
We continue to recruit and contract with clinics both in the United States and Poland. We can provide no assurance of additional recruitment or that treatments will occur in the near term and on a timely basis, if at all.
Little to No Cardiotoxicity
One of the key dose-limiting toxicities associated with currently available anthracyclines (including the anthracycline in Vyxeos) is their propensity to induce life-threatening heart damage. This is especially problematic for pediatric leukemia patients whose life spans can be severely shortened by the very induction therapy designed to cure them of acute leukemia. In the animal model relied upon by the FDA as an indicator of human cardiotoxicity, the non-liposomal (free) form of Annamycin has been shown to be significantly less likely than doxorubicin to create heart lesions in mice, and the liposomal formulation (L-Annamycin, which we refer to as Annamycin) has been shown in these same models to have reduced cardiotoxicity to the point where it is unlikely to cause harm to human patients. This possible lack of human cardiotoxicity means Annamycin may be able to be used more aggressively in helping patients achieve remission. This would be especially valuable in the case of pediatric acute leukemia (both AML and ALL) where long-term survival can be greatly impacted by cardiotoxicity. In our current Phase I/II trial for Annamycin, we will collect data to further validate the design intent of Annamycin to have little or no cardiotoxicity.
Circumventing Multidrug Resistance
In addition to cardiotoxicity, the effectiveness of currently approved anthracyclines is limited by their propensity for succumbing to “multidrug resistance,” whereby transmembrane proteins acting as transporters (one type of which is referred to as a “P-glycoprotein pump”) develop on the outer surface of cells to expel perceived threats like anthracyclines as a natural defense mechanism. The dosing of current therapies cannot be increased in an attempt to overcome multidrug resistance because of the likelihood of cardiotoxicity and other serious side effects. This limitation prevents adequate dosing of current anthracyclines to produce lasting remission in most patients. A laboratory study has suggested that Annamycin may resist being expelled by P-glycoprotein pumps and other similar tested multidrug resistance transporters, which may mean the drug circumvents multidrug resistance. This characteristic has been shown in pre-clinical testing to allow for higher drug uptake in diseased cells, which we believe could allow for more effective induction therapy with less risk to the patient.
The WP1066 Portfolio
We have a license agreement with MD Anderson pursuant to which we have been granted a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license for the patent and technology rights related to our WP1066 Portfolio and its close analogs, molecules targeting the modulation of key oncogenic transcription factors. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the FDA granted and Orphan Drug Designation ("ODD") for WP1066 for the treatment of glioblastoma.
WP1066 
WP1066 is our flagship Immune/Transcription Modulator. It has been the subject of over 50 peer-reviewed articles and its activity against p-STAT3 has now been validated in independent labs around the globe. This breakthrough discovery was inspired by a naturally occurring compound (caffeic acid) in propolis (from honey bees). Caffeic acid has shown a natural ability to inhibit p-STAT3, which is considered a master regulator of inflammatory processes that support tumor survival and proliferation. 
WP1066 has exhibited an ability to inhibit other key oncogenic transcription factors, including c-Myc and HIF-1α. A critical characteristic of WP1066 and its analogs is the ability to inhibit p-STAT3 independently of upstream cell signaling. We believe this overcomes the limitations of many other drugs designed to inhibit STAT3 activity by blocking upstream receptors.
Another important attribute of WP1066 (unlike some of our other Immune/Transcription Modulators) is its ability to cross the blood brain barrier, which we believe makes it a good candidate for potentially treating brain tumors and other malignancies of the central nervous system.
WP1066 has shown significant anti-tumor activity and increased survival in a wide range of tumor cell lines and animal models and this activity has been validated in multiple independent institutions worldwide. 
As with other analogs in this portfolio, WP1066 also has a demonstrated ability to boost a natural immune response to tumor activity. In animal models, WP1066 has been shown to upregulate STAT1, a transcription factor associated with immune stimulation. At the same time, it has been shown to reduce levels of Regulatory T-Cells, or TRegs, which are coopted by tumors to protect themselves from attack by the patient’s natural immune system. This forms a unique dual action (directly attacking the transcription factors that support tumor development and separately boosting the natural immune response to tumors) that may make WP1066 uniquely suited to treat a wide range of tumors and may also serve as an important element in combination therapies targeting some of the most difficult cancers.
In vitro testing has shown a high level of activity for WP1066 against a wide range of solid tumors, and in vivo testing has shown significant activity against head and neck, pancreatic, stomach, and renal cancers, as well as metastatic melanoma and glioblastoma, among others. In vivo testing in mouse tumor models has shown that WP1066 inhibits tumor growth, blocks angiogenesis (a process that leads to the formation of blood vasculature needed for tumor growth) and increases survival.
More recently, our own sponsored research and published findings from independent researchers point to the possibility that administration of WP1066 could lead to improved treatment results in many patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
Clinical Activity
WP1066 is currently being studied in a dose-escalation Phase I brain tumor clinical trial via an investigator-initiated IND with MD Anderson Cancer Center and we recently announced pharmacokinetic data from that trial. That data demonstrated sufficient bioavailability of our drug via oral administration to show the presence of WP1066 in blood plasma on a dose-dependent basis. Investigators at MD Anderson are now in the midst of the 3rd dose escalation cohort in this trial. At the most recent annual meeting of the Society for Neuro Oncology (SNO), Emory University researchers reported encouraging activity in animals with their in vitro pediatric brain tumor models using WP1066. Based on this data, they have indicated their intent to begin a trial for pediatric brain tumors in humans, although we can provide no assurance regarding the likelihood and timing of such trial.
This Phase I trial with WP1066 drug is being supported by $2 million in private grant funding at MD Anderson which is in addition to two Specialized Programs of Research Excellence or (SPORE) peer reviewed grants awarded by the National Cancer Institute. We believe the rigorous peer-review process applied to SPORE grant applications represents an important additional measure of independent assessment and validation of the research connected with our approach to using WP1066/STAT3 for the treatment of cancer. The grants described here do not flow through Moleculin's financial statements, but instead are applied to the cost of preclinical and clinical activities at and conducted by MD Anderson.
As with brain tumors, AML is often associated with a high upregulation of p-STAT3. Since WP1066 is a potent inhibitor of p-STAT3 and the MD Anderson brain tumor trial is now indicating the ability to get WP1066 into patients’ bloodstreams, we could now have a new way to combat AML, in addition to our Next Generation Anthracycline, Annamycin. In collaboration with Dr. Jorge Cortes of MD Anderson Cancer Center, Professor Waldemar Priebe, our drug’s inventor, has now been able to demonstrate activity of WP1066 against AML cell lines in vitro. We believe the data now supports a move to get WP1066 into clinical studies for the treatment of AML.
WP1220
An analog of WP1066, referred to as WP1220, was previously the subject of an IND (WP1220 was referred to as “MOL4239” for purposes of this IND) related to use of the molecule in the topical treatment of psoriasis. Clinical trials were commenced on WP1220 in the US, but were terminated early due to limited efficacy in the topical treatment of psoriatic plaques. Notwithstanding its limitations in treating psoriasis, our pre-clinical research in multiple cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”) cell lines has suggested that WP1220 may be effective in inhibiting CTCL. Based on this data, we are collaborating with a Polish drug development company, Dermin, which has received Polish government grant money to develop WP1220 in Poland for the topical treatment of early stage CTCL patients. CTCL is a potentially deadly form of skin cancer for which there are limited treatment options.
In September 2017, we engaged a CRO to prepare for a proof-of-concept clinical trial in Poland to study WP1220 for the topical treatment of CTCL. We submitted the CTA request to Polish regulatory authorities in 2018 and announced their approval of the CTA in February 2019. With this announcement, we now have three drugs in clinical, with a total of four clinical trials, representing a major milestone for Moleculin.
WP1732
In February 2018, we announced that, pursuant to our continued collaboration with MD Anderson we had developed and licensed what we believe, based on preclinical testing, is a potential breakthrough discovery – WP1732, a new molecule in the WP1066 portfolio – in our effort to develop a new cancer treatment that effectively targets highly resistant tumors. We believe this new discovery could improve our ability to treat a broader range of the most difficult cancers, and especially pancreatic cancer. Specifically, we have preclinical evidence to suggest this new molecule is capable of the same level of immune stimulation and inhibition of oncogenic transcription factors (including p-STAT3) as WP1066. 
The lead molecule resulting from this new discovery – WP1732 – not only appears to share the same key mechanistic properties with WP1066, it has markedly different organ distribution and we believe its significantly increased solubility makes it ideal for administration via standard intravenous (IV) injection. In addition, preclinical testing has also shown that, while WP1732 does not appear to cross the blood brain barrier, it appears to accumulate disproportionately in the pancreas, making it a potentially promising candidate for treating pancreatic cancer, one of the most resistant and deadly forms of cancer.
We have begun planning and performing the necessary pre-clinical work required to submit an IND for WP1732. In June 2018, we entered into an agreement with The University of Iowa Pharmaceuticals for the development of a formulation for WP1732. This agreement marked the beginning of creating a preclinical package to submit to the FDA in order to request Investigational New Drug status. We have now completed formulation development, and our IND-enabling toxicology work will be progressing via our Australian subsidiary, Moleculin Australia, and we expect to submit an IND in the US in 2019.
The WP1122 Portfolio
We have a license agreement with MD Anderson pursuant to which we have been granted a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license for the patent and technology rights related to our WP1122 Portfolio and similar molecules focused on inhibitors of glycolysis and glycosylation. 
We believe this technology has the potential to target a wide variety of solid tumors, which eventually become resistant to all treatments, and thereby provide a large and important opportunity for novel drugs. Notwithstanding this potential, we are currently focused on the use of WP1122 and related analogs for the treatment of central nervous system malignancies and especially glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM") . Although less prevalent than some larger categories of solid tumors, cancers of the central nervous system are particularly aggressive and resistant to treatment. The prognosis for such patients can be particularly grim and the treatment options available to their physicians are among the most limited of any cancer.
The American Cancer Society has estimated 23,820 new cases of brain and other nervous system cancers will occur in the United States in 2019, resulting in 17,760 deaths. Despite the severity and poor prognosis of these tumors, there are few FDA-approved drugs on the market.
WP1122
Moleculin is engaged in developing new drugs to exploit the metabolic differences between tumor cells and normal cells. With our lead Metabolism/Glycosylation Inhibitor compound, WP1122, we have been primarily focused on metabolically active brain cancers, taking advantage of the differential utilization of glucose by cancerous tissue versus normal brain cells. Moleculin believes that targeting this difference in metabolism is a promising, yet relatively unexplored strategy and could make its product candidates applicable to many other cancers.
Science has recognized that many types of cancer cells have a unique metabolism, distinct from that of normal cells. Cancer cells’ dependence on glycolysis (a specific way of converting glucose into energy) to proliferate and metastasize has been described as the “sweet tooth of cancer” and is a classic example of how the metabolism of cancer cells and normal cells differ. Glycolysis is a glucose-intensive means of producing energy that is used by normal cells only if oxygen levels are low. However, many types of tumor cells are essentially addicted to glycolysis even in the presence of abundant oxygen. This is known as the “Warburg Effect” after its discoverer, Dr. Otto Warburg, and such tumors are said to be highly “glycolytic.” 
This phenomenon of tumors relying preferentially on glycolysis and the resulting dramatic increase of glucose uptake to fulfill their metabolic demands has already been utilized very effectively in cancer diagnostics. It is the Warburg Effect that enables imaging of actively growing tumors by positron emission tomography (“PET scans”). This diagnostic test uses a
 fluorine-18 radiolabeled glucose decoy called F18DG that accumulates disproportionately in tumors, using the same process that increases glucose uptake and retention in cancer cells.
The success of PET scanning points to the potential therapeutic benefit of the tumor-specific inhibition of glycolysis that would block energy (adenosine triphosphate (“ATP”)) production and could potentially “starve tumor cells to death” and/or make them sensitive to other existing therapies, including radiotherapy. Unsuccessful attempts to realize this therapeutic potential have been made in the past, using a glucose decoy known as “2-deoxy-D-glucose” (2-DG). Those attempts to target the metabolism of tumor cells have failed, we believe, because of 2-DG’s lack of drug-like properties that include rapid metabolism, short half-life and limited tissue-organ distribution. Essentially, not enough 2-DG could be delivered to its intended target.
We have designed and are studying a novel and patented prodrug of 2-DG (WP1122). We believe WP1122 has the potential for developing into a technology platform for enabling increased cellular uptake, increased drug half-life and, importantly, enabling greater uptake and retention in organs where the most resistant and glycolytic tumors are localized, including the brain and pancreas.
WP1122 is a prodrug of a well-known glucose decoy called 2-deoxyglucose, or 2-DG, which enables increased cellular uptake, increased drug half-life and, importantly, an increased ability to cross the blood brain barrier, enabling greater uptake in the brain. Our approach was inspired by the same principle that distinguishes morphine from heroin. Heroin is chemically the diacetyl ester of morphine. While morphine has a limited ability to cross the blood brain barrier (making it a good candidate for pain killing without impairing mental function), its diacetyl form, heroin, has the ability to accumulate in the brain by 10 to 100 fold more than morphine. Once across the blood brain barrier, the acetyl groups are cleaved off by natural enzyme esterases, leaving pure morphine to accumulate in the brain.
We believe based on pre-clinical testing that, just like heroin, WP1122 crosses the blood brain barrier where its acetyl groups are cleaved off, allowing the resulting 2-DG to accumulate in the brain at a much higher rate than free 2-DG can do by itself.
Adding to the difficulty of using 2-DG in the treatment of tumors is the relatively short half-life of 2-DG and its general lack of drug-like properties preventing adequate accumulation in targeted organs. The free form of 2-DG is rapidly metabolized and rendered ineffective within minutes of entering the body. In contrast, WP1122 has a half-life of approximately 6 hours, making it much more feasible to deliver quantities adequate for a therapeutic effect. Animal studies have now shown that the prodrug structure of WP1122 results in accumulation in certain targeted organs, including the pancreas, making it a potentially good candidate for targeting pancreatic cancer.
WP1122 and its analogs (molecules with similar structures) have shown activity against brain tumor cell lines in in vitro testing and in an orthotopic brain tumor (implanted in the brain) animal model. In such studies, one candidate was shown to outperform Merck’s Temodar®, the frontline FDA approved drug, which is considered the standard of care for the treatment of brain tumors. The market for Temodar® has reached nearly $1 billion in annual revenue. We believe that WP1122 and similar compounds have the potential to address a significant unmet need in the treatment of brain tumors and may be applicable to other difficult-to-treat, glucose dependent tumors, such as pancreatic cancer.
Enhancing Immune Checkpoint Therapy
Immune checkpoint therapy has gained wide recognition as an important new approach to treating cancer, however many tumors appear to be resistant to immune checkpoint therapy and recent efforts to understand why have resulted in important new findings. A recently published study focused on this issue found that a process known as glycosylation plays an important role in the ability of checkpoint receptors to suppress immune activity and thereby protect tumors from attack. Beyond this, however, the researchers discovered that an alteration of the glycosylation of these receptor mechanisms could effectively prevent this evasion of the immune system. This study found that 2-DG was capable of making this alteration. These findings suggest that 2-DG could be beneficial as an anticancer agent in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and potentially with other anticancer therapies.
WP1234
In June 2017, we announced the discovery of a metabolic inhibitor with what may be increased potential to treat pancreatic cancer. In pre-clinical testing, WP1234, a modification to WP1122, has shown improved in-vitro drug characteristics and a 20 to 50-fold greater ability to kill pancreatic cancer cell lines when compared with WP1122. We know that pancreatic cancer thrives even in a reduced oxygen environment and is highly dependent on glycolysis (energy production by cells required when sufficient oxygen is not available) to proliferate and survive. We believe WP1234 may be a promising drug candidate to be studied for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic cancer is still considered largely untreatable, so even modest gains in treating this disease could represent a significant clinical benefit. In pre-clinical testing, WP1234 improves on known inhibitors for glycolysis by increasing drug circulation time and providing other critical drug-like properties, which we believe should increase the potential for drug uptake by and destruction of tumor cells. We intend to pursue development opportunities with WP1234 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and compare its activity with our other inhibitors, including WP1122.
Overview of the market for our oncology drugs
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States behind heart disease. In 2016, an estimated 15.5 million people in the United States were living with a past or current diagnosis of cancer and, the American Cancer Society estimates that in 2019, nearly 1.7 million new cases will be diagnosed and over 600,000 Americans will die from cancer.
Digestive, reproductive, breast and respiratory cancers comprise 65% of expected cancer diagnoses in 2018, while cancers like leukemia and brain tumors are considered “rare diseases.” Leukemia in particular, can be divided into acute, chronic and other, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) comprising 27,380 of the estimated 61,780 new cases expected in the United States in 2019.
The worldwide cancer drug business has been estimated to represent approximately $100 billion in annual sales. Our lead drug candidate, Annamycin, is in a class of drugs referred to as anthracyclines, which are chemotherapy drugs designed to destroy the DNA of targeted cancer cells. The most common approved anthracyclines are daunorubicin and doxorubicin and, prior to the expansion of their generic equivalents, annual revenues generated from anthracyclines have been estimated in the range of $600 million. Acute leukemia is one of a number of cancers that are treated with anthracyclines. One industry report estimates that annual drug revenues generated from the demand for AML-related therapies in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain were in the range of $151 million in 2012, and we believe that this number may increase if and when improved AML treatments are available.
Our other two active development projects have applications (among others) in the treatment of brain tumors, another rare disease for which there are few available treatments. The leading brain tumor drug is temozolomide, a drug introduced under the brand name Temodar. In 2012, one industry source reported annual revenues of approximately $882 million for Temodar before the expiration of its patent protection, at which point generic versions of the drug began to enter the market and reduce prices.
The Orphan Drug Act and other legislative initiatives provide incentives, including market exclusivity and accelerated approval pathways, for companies that pursue the development of treatments for rare diseases and serious diseases for which there are few or no acceptable available treatment alternatives. Over the last 10 years, an increasing number of companies have begun using these designations to obtain new drug approvals for drugs where patent coverage has expired and/or where accelerated approval appears possible. An IMS Health report estimated that, in 2013, the sale of drugs with full or partial Orphan Drug exclusivity represented approximately $29 billion in revenue. We consider obtaining Orphan Drug exclusivity and accelerated approval to be an important part of our development strategy for our drug candidates. Notwithstanding these potential opportunities, we can provide no assurance that our drugs will receive Orphan Drug designation (other than Annamycin and WP1066, both of which have received such designation) or, if approved, exclusivity or any other special designation that could, among other things, provide for accelerated approval.

In consideration, Dermin will pay a royalty for the sale of any licensed product in the Annamed licensed territories and pay all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by us in filing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents for which the license has been granted. Dermin also agrees to provide a percentage of certain consideration that Dermin receives pursuant to sublicense agreements. On June 29, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with MD Anderson licensing certain technology related to the method of preparing Liposomal Annamycin. The terms and payments of which are included in the summary above.
WP1066 Portfolio
The rights and obligations to a June 2010 Patent and Technology License Agreement entered into by and between Moleculin LLC and MD Anderson (the “Moleculin Agreement”) have been assigned to us. Therefore, we have obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to intellectual property rights, including patent rights, related to our WP1066 drug product candidate. In consideration, we must make payments to MD Anderson including an up-front payment, milestone payments and minimum annual royalty payments for sales of products developed under the license agreement. Annual maintenance fee payments will no longer be due upon marketing approval in any country of a licensed product. One-time milestone payments are due upon commencement of the first Phase III study for a licensed product within the United States, Europe, China or Japan; upon submission of the first NDA for a licensed product in the United States; and upon receipt of the first marketing approval for sale of a licensed product in the United States. The rights we have obtained pursuant to the assignment of the Moleculin Agreement are made subject to the rights of the U.S. government to the extent that the technology covered by the licensed intellectual property was developed under a funding agreement between MD Anderson and the U.S. government. The terms and payments of which are included in the summary above.
We entered into an out-licensing agreement with Houston Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“HPI”), pursuant to which we have granted certain intellectual property rights to HPI, including rights covering the potential drug candidate, WP1066 (“HPI Out-Licensing Agreement”). Under the HPI Out-Licensing Agreement, we must make quarterly payments totaling $0.75 million for the first twelve quarters following the effective date of the HPI Out-Licensing Agreement, or May 2, 2016, in consideration for the right to development data related to the development of licensed products. Notwithstanding our obligation to make the foregoing payments, the HPI Out-Licensing Agreement does not obligate HPI to conduct any research or to meet any milestones. Upon payment in the amount of $1.0 million to HPI within three years of the effective date of the HPI Out-Licensing Agreement we will regain all rights to the licensed subject matter and rights to any and all development data and any regulatory submissions including any IND, NDA or ANDA related to the licensed subject matter and can end the license without any other obligation other than the aforementioned quarterly payments. In the event that we do not exercise our right to regain our rights to the licensed subject matter within three years of the effective date of the HPI Out-Licensing Agreement, the license granted to HPI shall convert to an exclusive license upon HPI’s written notice and we shall be obligated to transfer all existing data relating to licensed subject matter including any development data and any IND to HPI. We have accrued the $1.0 million payment and intend to make the payment, subject to available funding.
In February 2018, we entered into a license agreement covering a new group of molecules recently discovered in connection with research we have been sponsoring at MD Anderson Cancer Center called WP1732, a part of the WP1066 Portfolio. The terms and payments of which are included in the summary above.
WP1122 Portfolio
The rights and obligations to an April 2012 Patent and Technology License Agreement entered into by and between IntertechBio and MD Anderson (the “IntertechBio Agreement”) have been assigned to us. Therefore, we have obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to intellectual property, including patent rights, related to our WP1122 Portfolio and to our drug product candidate, WP1122. The terms and payments of which are included in the summary above.
WPD Licensing Agreement
We entered into an agreement with WPD Pharmaceuticals (“WPD”), as described below. Such licensing agreements in Poland, we believe, may provide access to Polish grant money. We have previously entered into similar agreements with Dermin s.p. z.o.o. with some of our technologies in the same territories and Dermin has succeeded in obtaining grant funding in Poland benefiting our development objectives. We believe this is a potential non-dilutive source of capital. Furthermore, we believe that an added and extremely important benefit of this approach is that Moleculin does not have to invest its own resources in establishing an EU-based infrastructure that would be required to access such grant funding on our own. We believe this arrangement is consistent with our low overhead, capital efficient approach to development.
On February 19, 2019, we sublicensed certain intellectual property rights, including rights to Annamycin, our WP1122 portfolio, and our WP1066 portfolio to WPD Pharmaceuticals (“WPD”) (the “WPD Agreement”). WPD is affiliated with Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our founder and largest shareholder. Under the WPD Agreement, we granted WPD a royalty-bearing, exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, import, offer to sell and/or sell products in the field of human therapeutics under the licensed intellectual property in the countries of Germany, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Greece, Austria, Russia, Netherlands, Turkey, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Portugal, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, Finland, Luxembourg, Iceland (“licensed territories”), provided that we have the right to buyback Germany from the licensed territories by making a cash payment $500,000, or by issuing 235,850 shares of our common stock.
In consideration for entering into the WPD Agreement, WPD agreed that it must use Commercially Reasonable Development Efforts to develop and commercialize products in the licensed territories. For purposes of the WPD Agreement, the term “Commercially Reasonable Development Efforts” means the expenditure by or on behalf of WPD or any of its affiliates of at least: (i) $2,000,000 during the first two years of the agreement on the research, development and commercialization of products in the licensed territories; and (ii) $1,000,000 annually for the two years thereafter on the research and development of products in the licensed territories. 
In addition, within sixty days we agreed to transfer to WPD certain development data, and, in exchange for such development data, WPD agreed to make a development reimbursement fee to us in the amount of $300,000 (the “Development Reimbursement Fee”) within the first year of the agreement. Should WPD fail to make the Development Reimbursement Fee, then at our sole discretion: (i) Germany shall no longer be a part of the licensed territories; or (ii) the Commercially Reasonable Development Efforts during the first two years of the agreement shall increase from $2,000,000 to $2,500,000.
During the term of the WPD Agreement, to the extent we are required to make any payments to MD Anderson pursuant to our license agreements with MD Anderson, whether a milestone or royalty payment, as a result of the research and development or sale of a sublicensed product, WPD shall be required to advance or reimburse us such payments. In further consideration for the rights granted by us to WPD under the WPD Agreement, WPD agreed to pay us a royalty percentage at a rate equal to the royalty rate we owe MD Anderson under our license agreements with MD Anderson plus an additional royalty (the “override royalty percentage”) equal to 1.0% of net sales of any sublicensed products, provided, however, if WPD spends: (i) more than $5,000,000 in Commercially Reasonable Development Efforts prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of the agreement and more than $6,000,000 in Commercially Reasonable Development Efforts prior to the sixth anniversary of the date of the agreement, the override royalty percentage will decrease to 0.75% of net sales; or (ii) more than $6,000,000 in Commercially Reasonable Development Efforts prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of the agreement and more than $8,000,000 in Commercially Reasonable Development Efforts prior to the sixth anniversary of the date of the agreement, the override royalty percentage will decrease to 0.5% of net sales.
With certain exceptions, the WPD Agreement will remain in full force and effect until the expiration of the last patent within the sublicensed patents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we have the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate the WPD Agreement in whole, or to materially amend the agreement by removing a portion of the sublicensed subject matter, in connection with certain fundamental transactions or in connection with the granting to an unaffiliated third party of a license or sublicense to all or to a material portion of the sublicensed subject matter within all or substantially all of the licensed territories (such event, the “buyback event”) by making a payment to WPD equal to a percentage of the consideration after transaction costs we receive in connection with the buyback event. The percentage payable will be the greater of: (i) 2% increasing to 5% upon the completion by WPD of its initial public offering, provided such offering provides WPD with net proceeds of not less
 than $2.0 million; or (ii) 10% multiplied by a fraction (A) the numerator of which is the total dollar amount of expenditures made by WPD that represent Commercially Reasonable Development Efforts under the WPD Agreement, up to a maximum of $2.0 million; and (B) the denominator of which is $2.0 million.
Prior to approval of the WPD Agreement, our board of directors received a fairness opinion from Roth Capital Partners, LLC stating their opinion that the consideration we will receive from WPD pursuant to the WPD Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to us.
Animal Life Sciences Licensing Agreement
On February 19, 2019, we sublicensed certain intellectual property rights, including rights to Annamycin, our WP1122 portfolio, and our WP1066 portfolio in the field of non-human animals to Animal Life Sciences, LLC (“ALI”) (the “ALI Agreement”). ALI is affiliated with Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our founder and largest shareholder. Under the ALI Agreement, we granted ALI a worldwide royalty-bearing, exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, import, offer to sell and/or sell products in the field of non-human animals under the licensed intellectual property.
During the term of the ALI Agreement, to the extent we are required to make any payments to MD Anderson pursuant to our license agreements with MD Anderson, whether a milestone or royalty payment, as a result of the research and development or sale of a sublicensed product, ALI shall be required to advance or reimburse us such payments. In further consideration for the rights granted by us to ALI under the ALI Agreement, ALI agreed to pay us a royalty percentage at a rate equal to the royalty rate we owe MD Anderson under our license agreements with MD Anderson plus an additional royalty equal to 5.0% of net sales of any sublicensed products. As additional consideration, ALI issued us a 10% ownership interest in ALI.
With certain exceptions, the ALI Agreement will remain in full force and effect until the expiration of the last patent within the sublicensed patents.
Corporate History
We were founded in 2015 by Walter Klemp (our chairman and CEO), Dr. Don Picker (our Chief Science Officer) and Dr. Waldemar Priebe of MD Anderson (Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board) in order to combine and consolidate development efforts that include several MD Anderson oncology technologies. Dr. Priebe is a Professor of Medicinal Chemistry in the Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Division of Cancer Medicine, at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. This effort began with the acquisition of the Annamycin development project from AnnaMed, Inc., or AnnaMed, followed by the acquisition of the license rights to the WP1122 Portfolio from IntertechBio Corporation, or IntertechBio. Further, we undertook an effort to gain control of the WP1066 Portfolio, which culminated with the merger of Moleculin, LLC and MBI and the establishment of a co-development agreement with Houston Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or HPI, coincident with our IPO.
AnnaMed, a company controlled by Mr. Klemp, was formed in 2012 to take over the development of Annamycin from a prior drug development company. In 2012, AnnaMed out-licensed development rights in a limited territory to a Polish special purpose drug development company called Dermin in exchange for Dermin’s development work based on its successful effort to obtain Polish government grant funding to assist in the development of Annamycin. In August 2015, we entered into a rights transfer agreement with AnnaMed pursuant to which, in exchange for our common stock, AnnaMed agreed to transfer any and all data it had regarding the development of Annamycin and the Annamycin IND, including all trade secrets, know-how, confidential information and other intellectual property rights held by AnnaMed.
IntertechBio was formed in 2009 to license and begin development on the WP1122 Portfolio. The WP1122 Portfolio was also out-licensed to Dermin, which was awarded a Polish government grant to assist in drug development efforts. In August 2015, IntertechBio agreed to assign all license rights to us in exchange for our common stock. Drs. Priebe and Picker are shareholders of IntertechBio and control the voting and dispositive power over the shares of our common stock held by IntertechBio.
Moleculin, LLC was formed in 2006 and had been working to develop the WP1066 Portfolio it licensed from MD Anderson. As a part of the formation of Moleculin, LLC, an agreement was reached with HPI to limit Moleculin, LLC’s development efforts to uses in dermatology only, leaving non-dermatology indications to HPI. 
Prior to our IPO, Moleculin, LLC was merged with and into our company. Dr. Priebe, Mr. Klemp and Dr. Picker were members of Moleculin, LLC and received shares of our common stock as a result of the merger. In addition, Mr. Klemp and Dr. Picker were members of the board of Moleculin, LLC. The merger agreement contains mutual representations and warranties
 between the parties. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we agreed for a period of six years to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and/or officer of Moleculin, LLC whom Moleculin, LLC would have had the power to indemnify under Delaware law that is made a party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed proceeding or claim by reason of the fact that he or she was a director or officer of the Moleculin, LLC prior to the effective time of the merger and arising out of actions or omissions of the indemnified party in any such capacity occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger against any losses or damages reasonably incurred in connection with any claim. To our knowledge, no such proceeding or claim exists or has been threatened on the date hereof and Moleculin, LLC made representations to this effect in the merger agreement as of the date of such agreement. As additional consideration payable to the Moleculin, LLC unit holders, we agreed pursuant to the merger agreement that if drugs for dermatology indications are successfully developed by us (or our successors) using any of the Existing IP Assets, then the Moleculin, LLC unit holders, in the aggregate, will be entitled to receive a 2.5% royalty on the net revenues generated by such drugs. Any such net revenues would include a deduction for license fees or royalty obligations payable to MD Anderson for such Existing IP Assets. The merger agreement defined “Existing IP Assets” to mean all intellectual property, licensed by us and Moleculin, LLC as of the time of the merger, including, without limitation, the intellectual property licensed from MD Anderson under the Patent and Technology License Agreement entered into by and between IntertechBio Corporation and MD Anderson dated April 2, 2012, as amended, and the Patent and Technology License Agreement dated June 21, 2010, as amended, between MD Anderson and Moleculin, LLC, but excluding any intellectual property relating to Annamycin. The right to receive the contingent royalty payments described herein are for drugs developed only for dermatology indications, and do not include drugs developed for any other indications. We have no obligation of any nature to pursue the development of any drugs for dermatology indications.
Prior to our IPO, we entered into a co-development agreement with HPI whereby HPI is continuing its grant-funded research and making all resulting data available for our use in exchange for a development fee. We may buy HPI out of its co-development rights in the WP1066 Portfolio at our option. Please see the section “Business - License Agreements” for a description of our agreement with HPI. Drs. Priebe and Picker are shareholders of HPI, and Dr. Priebe has the voting and dispositive power over the shares of our common stock held by HPI.
In June 2018, we formed Moleculin Australia Pty. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary to oversee pre-clinical development in Australia. The Australian government provides an aggressive incentive for research and development carried out in their country. We believe having an Australian subsidiary could provide a great opportunity to speed up pre-clinical development and reduce the overall cost of our continued drug development efforts.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive segment of the pharmaceutical market, which market is highly competitive as a whole. We face competition from numerous sources including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources. Additionally, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, and some may be in direct competition with us. We may also compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
The unmet medical need for more effective cancer therapies is such that oncology drugs are one of the leading class of drugs in development. These include a wide array of products against cancer targeting many of the same indications as our drug candidates. While the introduction of newer targeted agents may result in extended overall survival, induction therapy regimens are likely to remain a cornerstone of cancer treatment in the foreseeable future.
There are a number of established therapies that may be considered competitive for the cancer indications for which we intend to develop our lead product candidate, Annamycin. A key consideration when treating AML patients is whether the patient is suitable for intensive therapy. The standard of care for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients who can tolerate intensive therapy is cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin or daunorubicin), typically referred to as a “7+3” regimen. For some patients, primarily those less than 60 years of age, a stem cell transplant could also be considered if the induction regimen is effective in attaining a CR (Complete Response). The 7+3 regimen of cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline has been the standard of care for decades. A patient not suitable for intensive therapy may be offered the option for low-intensity therapy such as low-dose cytarabine, azacitidine or decitabine. It should be noted that, in the United States, these are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of AML patients and there remains no effective therapy for these patients or for relapsed or refractory AML, with the exception of some recently approved targeted therapies that have demonstrated a low level of activity for limited subgroups of AML patients. The initial focus for Annamycin development is in patients for whom the standard induction regimen has failed. Also, several major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies are aggressively pursuing new cancer development programs for the treatment of AML.
A number of attempts have been made or are under way to provide an improved treatment for AML. Celator Pharmaceuticals reported Phase III clinical trial results for a new combined formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin (commonly used induction therapy drugs) they call Vyxeos. This new liposome formulation provides a 5:1 ratio of cytarabine and daunorubicin in each of three injections. When compared with patients receiving 7 injections of cytarabine and 3 injections of daunorubicin (traditional 7+3 induction therapy), patients receiving Vyxeos achieved an average increase in overall survival of approximately 3.5 months (9.5 months compared with 6 months). Despite this extension of overall survival, Vyxeos did not reduce the toxic side effects of daunorubicin (including cardiotoxicity) and it failed to qualify a significant majority of patients for curative bone marrow transplant. With these results, Jazz Pharmaceuticals acquired Celator in 2016 and obtained FDA approval, making Vyxeos the new first line standard of care for the treatment of AML
Drugs attempting to target a subset of AML patients who present with specific gene mutations, such as one referred to as FLT3, have recently received FDA approval, but by definition serve only subsets of the AML population. Other targeted therapies are currently in clinical trials, as well as other approaches that include immunotherapy relying on other biomarkers, other attempts at improved chemotherapy and alternative approaches to radiation therapy. Other approaches to improve the effectiveness of induction therapy are in early stage clinical trials and, although they do not appear to address the underlying problems with anthracyclines, we can provide no assurance that such improvements, if achieved, would not adversely impact the need for improved anthracyclines. A modified version of doxorubicin designed to reduce cardiotoxicity is in clinical trials for the treatment of sarcoma and, although this drug does not appear to address multidrug resistance and is not currently intended for the treatment of acute leukemia, we can provide no assurance that it will not become a competitive alternative to Annamycin. Although we are not aware of any other single agent therapies in clinical trials that would directly compete against Annamycin in the treatment of relapsed and refractory AML, we can provide no assurance that such therapies are not in development, will not receive regulatory approval and will reach market before our drug candidate Annamycin. In addition, any such competing therapy may be more effective and/or cost-effective than ours.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the US, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The pharmaceutical drug product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be marketed and distributed.
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA and related enforcement activity could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the US generally involves the following:
•Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations;
•Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
•Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s current good clinical practices (“GCP”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;
•Submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new pharmaceutical product;
•Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced, to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA.
The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals, and continued compliance are inherently uncertain.
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. These early proof-of-principle studies are done using sound scientific procedures and thorough documentation. The conduct of the single and repeat dose toxicology and toxicokinetic studies in animals must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA has concerns and notifies the sponsor. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. If resolution cannot be reached within the 30-day review period, either the FDA places the IND on clinical hold or the sponsor withdraws the application. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies for various reasons. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical study.
Clinical studies involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, how the results will be analyzed and presented and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at, or servicing, each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The pharmaceutical product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients, with a goal of characterizing the safety profile of the drug and establishing a maximum tolerable dose (“MTD”). Our pharmaceutical products fall into this latter category because its products are intended to treat cancer and contain cytotoxic agents. Hence, our Phase 1 studies are conducted in late-stage cancer patients whose disease has progressed after treatment with other agents.
•Phase 2: With the maximum tolerable dose established in a Phase 1 trial, the pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population at the MTD to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule and to identify patient populations with specific characteristics where the pharmaceutical product may be more effective.
•Phase 3: Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. The studies must be well controlled and usually include a control arm for comparison. One or two Phase 3 studies are usually required by the FDA for an NDA approval, depending on the disease severity and other available treatment options. In some instances, an NDA approval may be obtained based on Phase 2 clinical data with the understanding that the approved drug can be sold subject to a confirmatory trial to be conducted post-approval.
Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are often used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA also may require Phase 4 studies, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) and post-marketing surveillance, among other things, to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies may complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees. A waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA has 10 months after the 60-day filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard review NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months after the 60-day filing date for a priority review NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs.
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the pharmaceutical product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the pharmaceutical product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites as well as the site where the pharmaceutical product is manufactured to assure compliance with GCP and cGMP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. In addition, the FDA will require the review and approval of product labeling.
The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess pharmaceutical product safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new pharmaceutical products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new pharmaceutical products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, if the FDA determines that the schedule is acceptable and if the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
Any product submitted to the FDA for market, including a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for other FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious condition and it offers a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new pharmaceutical product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, accelerated approval may be available for a product intended to treat a serious condition that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments, which means the product may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials for products receiving accelerated approval, which could impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any pharmaceutical products for which the Company receives FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, cGMP compliance, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, actions by the U.S. Department of Justice and/or U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available pharmaceutical products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not directly or indirectly market or promote such off-label uses.
We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our pharmaceutical product candidates, some of our products covered by U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process for a product the approval of which is the first permitted commercial marketing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved pharmaceutical product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent unless an extension is obtained. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and renders a decision on the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may be able to apply for extension of patent term for one or more of our currently licensed patents or any future owned patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending upon the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA or seeking approval for a similar product. Pediatric exclusivity adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms and may be granted based on the completion of a pediatric clinical study that “fairly responds” to an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a clinical study.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the pharmaceutical product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific pharmaceutical products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not, and frequently does not, include all of the FDA-approved pharmaceutical products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, in the United States there is a growing emphasis on comparative effectiveness research, both by private payers and by government agencies. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our pharmaceutical product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. To the extent other drugs or therapies are found to be more effective than our products, payers may elect to cover such therapies in lieu of our products and/or reimburse our products at a lower rate.
Orphan Drug exclusivity prevents for seven years the approval of another product with the same active moiety for the same rare disease. If a product is a new chemical entity (i.e., generally that the moiety has not previously been approved), it may receive five years of exclusivity, during which period FDA may not accept for review certain NDAs for another product with the same moiety. If approval of a product required new clinical data, it may convey three years of exclusivity against approval of certain NDAs for similar products.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular pharmaceutical product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect this will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we may receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future drugs.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had nine full-time employees and four part-time employees, and accordingly, a high percentage of the work performed for our development projects is outsourced to qualified independent contractors.
