Vision Bancshares Trust I
In connection with the merger of Vision Bancshares, Inc. (“Vision”) into Park in March of 2007 (the “Vision Merger”), Park entered into a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of the effective time of the Vision Merger (the “First Supplemental Indenture”), with Vision and Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware banking corporation, as Trustee. Under the terms of the First Supplemental Indenture, Park assumed all of the payment and performance obligations of Vision under the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of December 5, 2005 (the “Indenture”), pursuant to which Vision issued $15.5 million of junior subordinated notes to Vision Bancshares Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust (the “Vision Trust”). The junior subordinated notes were issued by Vision in connection with the sale by the Vision Trust of $15.0 million of floating rate preferred securities to institutional investors on December 5, 2005.
Under the terms of the First Supplemental Indenture, Park also succeeded to and was substituted for Vision with the same effect as if Park had originally been named (i) as “Depositor” in the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement of the Vision Trust, dated as of December 5, 2005 (the “Trust Agreement”), among Vision, Wilmington Trust Company, as Property Trustee and as Delaware Trustee, and the Administrative Trustees named therein and (ii) as “Guarantor” in the Guarantee Agreement, dated as of December 5, 2005 (the “Guarantee Agreement”), between Vision and Wilmington Trust Company, as Guarantee Trustee. Through these contractual obligations, Park has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the Vision Trust’s obligations with respect to the floating rate preferred securities.
Both the junior subordinated notes and the floating rate preferred securities mature on December 30, 2035 (which maturity may be shortened), and carry a floating interest rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 148 basis points. Payment of interest on the junior subordinated notes, and payment of cash distributions on the floating rate preferred securities, may be deferred at any time or from time to time for a period not to exceed twenty consecutive quarters, subject to specified conditions.

Under the terms of the Indenture and the related Guarantee Agreement, Park, as successor to Vision in accordance with the First Supplemental Indenture, is prohibited, subject to limited exceptions, from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on, or redeeming, repurchasing, acquiring or making any liquidation payments with respect to, any shares of Park’s capital stock (i) if an event of default under the Indenture has occurred and continues; (ii) if Park is in default with respect to the payment of any obligations under the Guarantee Agreement; or (iii) during any period in which the payment of interest on the junior subordinated notes by Park (and the payment of cash distributions on the floating rate preferred securities by the Vision Trust) is being deferred. The floating rate preferred securities are considered Tier 1 Capital under regulatory capital standards.

Recent Developments
Acquisition of NewDominion Bank
On July 1, 2018, NewDominion Bank, a North Carolina state-charted bank ("NewDominion"), merged with and into Park National Bank (the "NewDominion Merger"), with Park National Bank continuing as the surviving entity pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of January 22, 2018 (the "NewDominion Merger Agreement"), by and among Park, Park National Bank and New Dominion.
In accordance with the terms of the NewDominion Merger Agreement, NewDominion shareholders were permitted to make an election to receive for their shares of NewDominion common stock either $1.08 in cash without interest (the "cash consideration") or 0.01023 of a Park common share, plus cash in lieu of any fractional Park common share (the "stock consideration"). Based on the terms of the NewDominion Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration to be paid in the NewDominion Merger was subject to proration and allocation procedures to ensure that 60 percent of the shares of NewDominion common stock outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the NewDominion Merger were exchanged for the stock consideration and the remaining 40 percent of the shares of NewDominion common stock outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the NewDominion Merger were exchanged for the cash consideration, including, in each case, shares of NewDominion common stock subject to NewDominion options and restricted stock awards. The aggregate merger consideration consisted of 435,457 Park common shares, valued at $48.5 million, and $30.7 million in cash to acquire 91.45% of the outstanding shares of NewDominion common stock. The cash was funded through cash on hand from Park. The remaining 8.55% of the outstanding shares of NewDominion common stock were previously held by Park. Park recognized a gain of $3.5 million as a result of the remeasuring to fair value of its 8.55% equity interest in NewDominion held before the NewDominion Merger.
Since the July 1, 2018 effective date of the NewDominion Merger, NewDominion has operated as the NewDominion Bank Division of Park National Bank with its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Pending Merger with CAB Financial Corporation
On September 12, 2018, Park and CAB Financial Corporation, a South Carolina corporation (“CABF”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “CABF Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which CABF will merge with and into Park (the “CABF Merger”). Following the CABF Merger, CABF’s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Carolina Alliance Bank, will merge with and into Park's wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Park National Bank, with Park National Bank as the surviving bank. Subject to the terms and conditions of the CABF Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the CABF Merger (the “CABF Effective Time”), CABF shareholders will receive, in exchange for each share of CABF’s common stock, $1.00 par value per share, (i) $3.80 in cash and (ii) 0.1378 of Park's common shares (the “CABF Merger Consideration”). 
-3-

At the CABF Effective Time, CABF stock options with an exercise price of less than $19.00 will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the CABF Merger Consideration. CABF stock options with an exercise price of $19.00 or more will be assumed and converted into an option to purchase Park common shares, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such CABF stock options. At the CABF Effective Time, CABF restricted stock awards will fully vest (with any performance-based vesting condition deemed satisfied) and will be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive CABF Merger Consideration. 
The CABF Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants of each party. CABF has agreed not to solicit acquisition proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions. In addition, CABF has agreed not to participate in discussions or negotiations or provide information in connection with any acquisition proposals for alternative business combination transactions unless certain conditions are satisfied. 
Closing of the CABF Merger is subject to customary conditions, including, among others, approval of the CABF Merger Agreement by CABF’s shareholders, receipt of required regulatory approvals, effectiveness of the registration statement filed by Park to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the Park common shares to be issued in the CABF Merger, and approval for listing on NYSE AMERICAN with respect to the Park common shares to be issued in the CABF Merger. On November 19, 2018, the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-228145) filed by Park to register under the Securities Act the Park common shares to be issued in the CABF Merger, was declared effective by the SEC. On December 17, 2018, Park National Bank received regulatory approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") for the merger of Carolina Alliance Bank with and into Park National Bank. On January 14, 2019, the shareholders of CABF voted in favor of approving the CABF Merger.
The CABF Merger Agreement provides certain termination rights for each party and further provides that, in the event the CABF Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a competing acquisition transaction, CABF will be required to pay Park a termination fee equal to $5,317,500. 
The CABF Merger is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2019.

Lending Activities
Park National Bank deals with consumers as well as with a wide cross-section of businesses and corporations located primarily in the 29 Ohio counties, one county in Kentucky and two counties in North Carolina served by the financial service offices of Park National Bank. At December 31, 2018, Park National Bank had no concentration of loans to borrowers engaged in the same or similar industries that exceeded 10% of total loans nor did it have any loans outstanding to persons domiciled outside the United States. As a result of the Vision Bank - SEPH merger, SEPH holds loans originated by Vision Bank previously serviced by the financial service offices of Vision Bank. It is expected that SEPH will originate loans only to further the collection efforts with respect to the loans transferred to SEPH by operation of law as a result of the Vision Bank - SEPH merger. Such origination (or modification) volume is expected to be insignificant to the consolidated Park entity.
Park National Bank makes lending decisions in accordance with the written loan policies adopted by Park which are designed to maintain acceptable loan quality. Park National Bank originates and retains for its own portfolio commercial and commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans, home equity lines of credit, and installment loans. Park National Bank also originates fixed-rate residential real estate loans for sale to the secondary market.
Guardian Finance originates and retains for its own portfolio consumer installment loans and commercial loans. Guardian Finance makes lending decisions in accordance with the written loan policy adopted and approved by the Guardian Finance Board of Directors.
There are certain risks inherent in making loans. These risks include changes in the credit worthiness of borrowers over the time period in which loans may be repaid, interest rate changes over the time period in which loans may be repaid, risks resulting from changes in the national and local economies, risks inherent in dealing with borrowers and, in the case of loans secured by collateral, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.
Commercial Loans
At December 31, 2018, Park’s subsidiaries (including Scope Aircraft Finance) had approximately $2,358 million in commercial loans (commercial, financial and agricultural loans and commercial real estate loans) and commercial leases outstanding, representing approximately 41.4% of their total aggregate loan portfolio as of that date. Of this amount, approximately $1,073 million represented commercial, financial and agricultural loans, $1,283 million represented commercial real estate loans, and $2 million represented commercial leases. 
Commercial loans are made for a wide variety of general corporate purposes, including financing for industrial and commercial properties, financing for equipment, inventory and accounts receivable, acquisition financing, commercial leasing, and to consumer finance companies. The term of each commercial loan varies by its purpose. Repayment terms are structured such that commercial loans will be repaid within the economic useful life of the underlying asset. Information concerning the loan maturity distribution within the commercial loan portfolio is provided in Table 14 - Selected Loan Maturity Distribution included in the section of Park’s 2018 Annual Report captioned “MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS,” and is incorporated herein by reference.
The commercial loan portfolio of Park’s current subsidiaries includes loans to a wide variety of corporations and businesses across many industrial classifications in the 29 Ohio counties, one Kentucky county and two North Carolina counties where Park National Bank operates and, in the case of Park's non-bank consumer finance business, across the United States. The primary industries represented by these customers include real estate rental and leasing, finance and insurance, construction, agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, manufacturing, retail trade, health care, accommodation and food services and other services.
Commercial loans are evaluated for the adequacy of repayment sources at the time of approval and are regularly reviewed for any possible deterioration in the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. The credit information required generally includes, depending on the amount of money lent, financial statements, third-party prepared financial statements, two years of federal income tax returns and a current credit report. Loan terms include amortization schedules commensurate with the purpose of each loan, identification of the source of each repayment and the risk involved. In most instances, collateral is required to provide an additional source of repayment in the event of default by a commercial borrower. The structure of the collateral package, including the type and amount of the collateral, varies from loan to loan depending on the financial strength of the borrower, the amount and terms of the loan and the collateral available to be pledged by the borrower. Most often, the collateral is inventory, machinery, accounts receivable and/or real estate. The guarantee of the business owners/principals is generally required on loans made to closely-held business entities.
-5-

Commercial real estate loans (“CRE loans”) include mortgage loans to developers and owners of commercial real estate. The lending policy for CRE loans is designed to address the unique risk attributes of CRE lending. The collateral for CRE loans is the underlying commercial real estate. Park National Bank generally requires that the CRE loan amount be no more than 85% of the purchase price or the appraised value of the commercial real estate securing the CRE loan, whichever is less. CRE loans made for Park National Bank’s portfolio generally have a variable interest rate. For more information concerning the loan maturity distribution in the CRE loan portfolio, please see Table 14 - Selected Loan Maturity Distribution included in the section of Park’s 2018 Annual Report captioned “MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS,” which is incorporated herein by reference.
The regulatory limit for loans made to one borrower by Park National Bank was $106.4 million at December 31, 2018. Participations in a loan by Park National Bank in an amount larger than $30.0 million are generally sold to third-party banks or financial institutions. While Park National Bank has a loan limit of $106.4 million, the total exposure of the largest single borrower within the commercial portfolio was $30.0 million at December 31, 2018.
Park has an independent, internal loan review program which annually evaluates all loans greater than $1 million, all new loans greater than $500,000 and a risk-based sample of loans less than $1 million. If a loan has deteriorated, the lending subsidiary takes prompt action designed to increase the likelihood that it will be repaid. Upon detection of the reduced ability of a borrower to service interest and/or principal on a loan, the subsidiary may downgrade the loan and, under certain circumstances, place the loan on nonaccrual status. The subsidiary then works with the borrower to develop a payment schedule which the subsidiary anticipates will permit service of the principal and interest on the loan by the borrower. Loans which deteriorate and show the inability of a borrower to repay principal are charged down to the net realizable value of collateral. A collection specialist/work-out officer is available to assist each subsidiary when a credit deteriorates. Information about Park’s policy for placing loans on nonaccrual status is included under the caption “Loans” in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Park’s 2018 Annual Report, and is incorporated herein by reference.
Commercial loans are generally viewed as having a higher credit risk than consumer loans because commercial loans usually involve larger loan balances to a single borrower and are more susceptible to a risk of default during an economic downturn. Commercial loans generally have variable interest rates. Park uses several indices for commercial loans that help determine loan interest rates. However, the national prime rate is the most common index Park uses. Credit risk for commercial loans arises from borrowers lacking the ability or willingness to pay principal or interest and, in the case of secured loans, by a shortfall in the collateral value in relation to the outstanding loan balance in the event of a default and subsequent liquidation of collateral. The underwriting of generally all commercial loans, regardless of type, includes cash flow analyses with rates shocked by 400 basis points. In the case of commercial loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of each borrower to collect amounts due from the borrower's customers. In the case of Park's commercial loans to non-bank consumer finance companies, the underlying cash flows are supported at times by sub-prime individual borrowers and present a higher level of risk compared to a more typical commercial loan to a business. Other collateral securing commercial loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the borrower’s business. Information concerning the loan loss experience and the allocation of the allowance for loan losses related to the commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio and the commercial real estate portfolio is provided in Table 29 - Summary of Loan Loss Experience and Table 30 - Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses, respectively, included in the section of Park’s 2018 Annual Report captioned “MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS,” and is incorporated herein by reference.
Loans to Non-Bank Consumer Finance Companies
At December 31, 2018, Park National Bank had $238 million in loans outstanding to non-bank consumer finance companies. This is a national lending unit of Park National Bank. These asset-based loans are collateralized by cash flows from individuals, typically auto loans with the consumer finance company, which is Park's borrower. These loans typically present a higher level of risk due to the underlying collateral and such risks are mitigated by more conservative underwriting and an intensive loan monitoring regimen commensurate with asset-based lending.

Aircraft Financing
Scope Aircraft Finance specializes in aircraft financing. The customers of Scope Aircraft Finance include small businesses and entrepreneurs intending to use the aircraft for business or pleasure. The customers of Scope Aircraft Finance are located throughout the United States. The lending officers of Scope Aircraft Finance are experienced in the aircraft financing industry and rely upon that experience and industry guides in determining whether to grant an aircraft loan or lease. At December 31, 2018, Scope Aircraft Finance had outstanding approximately $266 million in loans primarily secured by aircraft (which are included in the commercial loan portfolio).
Consumer Loans
At December 31, 2018, Park's subsidiaries had outstanding consumer loans (including automobile loans and leases) in an aggregate amount of $1,292 million, constituting approximately 22.7% of their aggregate total loan portfolio. Park's subsidiaries make installment credit available to customers and prospective customers in their primary market areas through direct and indirect loans. Indirect loans are facilitated through an automobile dealer; whereas, direct loans are originated through direct customer interaction with Park's subsidiaries. For both direct and indirect loans, the final credit decisions are made by Park's subsidiaries with the assistance of an automated underwriting system. At December 31, 2018, of the $1,292 million in consumer loans, $1,089 million were originated through indirect lending, while the remaining $203 million are considered direct loans. At December 31, 2018, of the $1,292 million in consumer loans, GFSC had outstanding consumer loans of $29 million and Park National Bank had the balance.
Credit approval for direct and indirect consumer loans requires income sufficient to repay principal and interest due, stability of employment, an established credit record and sufficient collateral for secured loans. It is the policy of Park to adhere strictly to all laws and regulations governing consumer lending. A compliance officer, along with the appropriate line of business leaders, are responsible for monitoring each subsidiary’s performance and advising and updating loan personnel in this area. Each subsidiary reviews its consumer loan portfolio monthly and charges off loans which do not meet Park’s standards. Information about Park’s policy for placing loans on nonaccrual status is included under the caption “Loans” in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Park’s 2018 Annual Report, and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields as compared to real estate mortgage loans, but generally carry higher risks of default. Consumer loan collections are dependent on borrowers' continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans. Information concerning the loan loss experience and the allocation of the allowance for loan losses related to the consumer loan portfolio is provided in Table 29 - Summary of Loan Loss Experience and Table 30 - Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses, respectively, included in the section of Park’s 2018 Annual Report captioned “MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS,” and is incorporated herein by reference.
Residential Real Estate and Construction Loans
At December 31, 2018, Park's subsidiaries had outstanding approximately $2,042 million in construction real estate loans and residential real estate loans, representing approximately 35.9% of total loans outstanding. Of the $2,042 million, approximately $1,794 million was included within the residential real estate loan segment, which included $430 million of commercial real estate loans, $1,134 million of mortgage loans, $215 million of home equity lines of credit and $14 million of installment loans. The remaining $248 million was included within the construction real estate loan segment, which included $175 million of commercial land and development (“CL&D”) loans, $71 million of 1-4 family residential construction loans, and $2 million of installment loans. Included within the $248 million of loans within the construction real estate loan segment was $1.6 million of loans held by SEPH. The market area for real estate lending by Park National Bank is concentrated in Ohio, Kentucky and North Carolina. 
Credit approval for residential real estate loans requires demonstration of sufficient income to repay the principal and interest and the real estate taxes and insurance, stability of employment, an established credit record and a current independent third-party appraisal providing the market value of the real estate securing the loan. Residential real estate loans are generally analyzed through an automated underwriting platform (system) to determine a risk classification. All loans receiving a risk classification of caution require review by a senior lender and generally require additional documentation if the loan is approved.
-7-

Park National Bank generally requires that the residential real estate loan amount be no more than 80% of the purchase price or the appraised value of the real estate securing the loan, whichever is less, unless private mortgage insurance is obtained by the borrower. Loans in this lending category which are made to be held in the bank’s portfolio are both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate, fully amortized mortgages. The rates used are generally fully-indexed rates. From time to time, Park may offer a limited-time promotional rate on funds advanced on newly-originated home equity lines of credit. Park National Bank also originates fixed-rate real estate loans for sale to the secondary market. Prior to 2010, these loans were generally sold immediately after closing. However, beginning in 2010 and continuing through December 31, 2014, Park’s management made a decision to retain certain 15-year, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, which previously would have been sold in the secondary market. Subsequent to December 31, 2014, Park has generally sold these loans in the secondary market. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Park reported $569 million and $565 million, respectively, of 15-year, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Real estate loans are typically secured by first mortgages with evidence of title in favor of the lender in the form of an attorney’s opinion of title or a title insurance policy. Park National Bank has also required proof of hazard insurance with the lender named as the mortgagee and as the loss payee. Independent third-party appraisals are generally obtained for consumer real estate loans.
Home equity lines of credit are generally secured by second mortgages by Park National Bank. The maximum amount of a home equity line of credit is generally limited to 85% of the appraised value of the property less the balance of the first mortgage. The home equity lines of credit are written with ten-year terms. A variable interest rate is generally charged on the home equity lines of credit. 
Information concerning the loan loss experience and the allocation of the allowance for loan losses related to the residential real estate portfolio is provided in Table 29 - Summary of Loan Loss Experience and Table 30 - Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses, respectively, included in the section of Park’s 2018 Annual Report captioned “MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS,” and is incorporated herein by reference.
Construction loans include commercial construction loans as well as residential construction loans. Construction loans may be in the form of a permanent loan or a short-term construction loan, depending on the needs of the individual borrower. Generally, the permanent construction loans have a variable interest rate although a permanent construction loan may be made with a fixed interest rate for a term generally not exceeding five years. Short-term construction loans are made with variable interest rates. Information concerning the loan maturity distribution within the construction financing portfolio is provided in Table 14 - Selected Loan Maturity Distribution included in the section of Park’s 2018 Annual Report captioned “MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS,” and is incorporated herein by reference.
Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, the division holding the loan may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. If the estimate of value proves inaccurate, the division holding the loan may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project having a value insufficient to assure full repayment, should the borrower default. In the event a default on a construction loan occurs and foreclosure follows, the division holding the loan must take control of the project and attempt either to arrange for completion of construction or to dispose of the unfinished project. Additional risk exists with respect to a loan made to a developer who does not have a buyer for the property, as the developer may lack funds to pay the loan if the property is not sold upon completion. Park National Bank attempts to reduce such risks on loans to developers by requiring personal guarantees and reviewing current personal financial statements and tax returns as well as other projects undertaken by the developer. For additional information concerning the loan loss experience, please see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS – Economic, Political and Market Risks - Changes in economic and political conditions could adversely affect our earnings and capital through declines in deposits, loan demand, our borrowers’ ability to repay loans, and the value of the collateral securing our loans.” and “– Business Operations Risks - Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb the probable, incurred losses in our loan portfolio.” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Information concerning the loan loss experience and the allocation of the allowance for loan losses related to the construction financing portfolio is provided in Table 29 - Summary of Loan Loss Experience and Table 30 - Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses, respectively, included in the section of Park’s 2018 Annual Report captioned “MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS,” and is incorporated herein by reference.

SE Property Holdings, LLC
SEPH is a non-bank subsidiary of Park, holding OREO property and non-performing loans. In addition to approximately $1.5 million in OREO property, SEPH also held approximately $1.6 million in loans as of December 31, 2018, all of which were on nonaccrual status. SEPH has one office in Licking County, Ohio. The SEPH employees are dedicated to working with a third-party work-out specialist to ensure effective and efficient resolution to the non-performing loans and OREO, while working closely with the borrowers of the loans to maximize collection efforts. It is expected that the loans and OREO will reduce over time and result in cash in-flow to Park.
Competition
The financial services industry is highly competitive. Park’s subsidiaries compete with other local, regional and national service providers, including banks, savings associations, credit unions and other types of financial institutions and finance companies. Other competitors include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies. Competition within the financial services industry continues to increase as a result of mergers between, and expansion of, providers of financial services within and outside Park’s primary market area.
The primary factors in competing for loans are interest rates charged and overall services provided to borrowers. The primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates paid on deposits, account liquidity, convenience and hours of office locations, convenience and availability of mobile banking options, and accessibility to trained and competent staff to deliver services. However, some competitors of Park’s subsidiaries may have greater resources and, as such, higher lending limits, which may adversely affect the ability of Park’s subsidiaries to compete. In addition, some of the providers of financial services with which Park’s subsidiaries compete enjoy the benefits of fewer regulatory constraints and lower cost structures.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, Park and its subsidiaries had 1,782 full-time equivalent employees.
Supervision and Regulation of Park and its Subsidiaries
Park, Park National Bank and Park’s other subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state agencies. The regulation of financial holding companies and their subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of consumers, depositors, borrowers, the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders. Applicable laws and regulations restrict permissible activities and investments and require actions to protect loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary and other customers, as well as the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund. They also may restrict Park’s ability to repurchase its common shares or to receive dividends from Park National Bank and impose capital adequacy and liquidity requirements.
As a financial holding company, Park is subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act and to inspection, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. Park is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act, and the Exchange Act, as administered by the SEC. Park’s common shares are listed on NYSE AMERICAN under the trading symbol “PRK,” which subjects Park to the requirements under the applicable sections of the NYSE AMERICAN Company Guide for listed companies.
Park National Bank, as a national banking association, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination primarily by the OCC and secondarily by the FDIC.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"), which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers. The CFPB is authorized to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices and ensures consistent enforcement of laws so that consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. Since its establishment, the CFPB has exercised extensively its rulemaking and interpretative authority.
Guardian Finance, as an Ohio state-chartered consumer finance company, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions and, as a subsidiary of Park, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board.
-9-

As a subsidiary of Park, SEPH is subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board.

The following information describes selected federal and state statutory and regulatory provisions and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the particular statutory or regulatory provisions. These statutes and regulations are continually under review by the United States Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Park and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on their respective businesses.
Regulation of Financial Holding Companies
As a financial holding company, Park’s activities are subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. Park is required to file reports with the Federal Reserve Board and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require, and is subject to regular examinations by the Federal Reserve Board.
The Federal Reserve Board also has extensive enforcement authority over financial holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to:

• | assess civil money penalties;


• | issue cease and desist or removal orders; and


• | require that a financial holding company divest subsidiaries (including a subsidiary bank).

In general, the Federal Reserve Board may initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
A financial holding company is required by law and Federal Reserve Board policy to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve Board may require a financial holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the payment of dividends to shareholders if the Federal Reserve Board believes the payment of such dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice.
The Bank Holding Company Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board in any case where a financial holding company proposes to:

• | acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank that is not already majority-owned by the financial holding company;


• | acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or another financial or bank holding company; or


• | merge or consolidate with any other financial or bank holding company.

A qualifying bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company and thereby affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature and not otherwise permissible for a bank holding company, if (i) the holding company is "well managed" and "well capitalized" and (ii) each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act of 1991 prompt corrective action provisions, is well managed, and has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. Park became a financial holding company in 2014. No regulatory approval is required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board. 
The Financial Services Modernization Act defines “financial in nature” to include: 

• | securities underwriting, dealing and market making;


• | sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies;


• | insurance underwriting and agency;

-10-


• | merchant banking; and


• | activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to banking.

A national bank also may engage, subject to limitations on investment, in activities that are financial in nature, other than insurance underwriting, insurance company portfolio investment, real estate development and real estate investment, through a financial subsidiary of the bank, if the bank is well capitalized and well managed and has at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating. If a financial holding company or a subsidiary bank fails to maintain all requirements for the holding company to maintain financial holding company status, material restrictions may be placed on the activities of the holding company and its subsidiaries and on the ability of the holding company to enter into certain transactions and obtain regulatory approvals for new activities and transactions. The holding company could also be required to divest itself of subsidiaries that engage in activities that are not permitted for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. If restrictions are imposed on the activities of a financial holding company, the existence of such restrictions may not be made publicly available pursuant to confidentiality regulations of the bank regulatory agencies. 
Each subsidiary bank of a financial holding company is subject to certain restrictions on the maintenance of reserves against deposits, extensions of credit to the financial holding company or any of its subsidiaries, investments in the stock or other securities of the financial holding company or its subsidiaries and the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Further, a financial holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of any services. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of these subsidiaries.
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act
On May 25, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the "Regulatory Relief Act") was signed into law. The Regulatory Relief Act was designed to provide regulatory relief for banking organizations, particularly for all but the very largest, those with assets in excess of $250 billion. Bank holding companies with assets of less than $100 billion are no longer subject to enhanced prudential standards, and those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be relieved of those requirements in 18 months, unless the Federal Reserve Board takes action to maintain those standards. Certain regulatory requirements applied only to banks with assets in excess of $50 billion and so did not apply to Park even before the enactment of the Regulatory Relief Act.
The Regulatory Relief Act also provides that the banking regulators must adopt regulations implementing the provision that banking organizations with assets of less than $10 billion are permitted to satisfy capital standards and be considered "well capitalized" under the prompt corrective action framework if their leverage ratios of tangible equity to average consolidated assets is between 8% and 10%, unless the banking organization's federal banking agency determines that the banking organization's risk profile warrants a more stringent leverage ratio. The OCC, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have proposed for comment the leverage ratio framework for any banking organization with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, limited amounts of certain types of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%. The community bank leverage ratio would be calculated as the ratio of tangible equity capital divided by average total consolidated assets. Tangible equity capital would be defined as total bank equity capital or total holding company equity capital, as applicable, prior to including minority interests, and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, goodwill and other intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing assets). Average total assets would be calculated in a manner similar to the current tier 1 leverage ratio denominator in that amounts deducted from the community bank leverage ratio numerator would also be excluded from the community bank leverage ratio denominator.
The OCC, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC also adopted a rule providing banking organizations with the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of new current expected credit loss methodology accounting under United States generally accepted accounting principles.
The Regulatory Relief Act also relieves bank holding companies and banks with assets of less than $100 billion in assets from certain record-keeping, reporting and disclosure requirements.
Transactions with Affiliates, Directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Board Regulation W generally:

• | limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate;

-11-


• | limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with all affiliates; and


• | require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or subsidiary, as those provided to a non-affiliate.

An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to the affiliate, the purchase of assets from the affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of the affiliate, the purchase of securities issued by the affiliate and other similar types of transactions.

A bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders, as well as entities such persons control, is subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder by the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these loans must be made on terms (including interest rates charged and collateral required) substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals or be made as part of a benefit or compensation program and on terms widely available to employees, and must not involve a greater than normal risk of repayment. In addition, the amount of loans a bank may make to these persons is based, in part, on the bank’s capital position, and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans which exceed specified amounts.
Regulation of Nationally-Chartered Banks
As a national banking association, Park National Bank is subject to regulation under the National Banking Act and is periodically examined by the OCC. OCC regulations govern permissible activities, capital requirements, dividend limitations, investments, loans and other matters. Furthermore, Park National Bank is subject, as a member bank, to certain rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, many of which restrict activities and prescribe documentation to protect consumers. Park National Bank is an insured depository institution and a member of the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (the "DIF"). As a result, it is subject to regulation and deposit insurance assessments by the FDIC. In addition, the establishment of branches by Park National Bank is subject to prior approval of the OCC. The OCC has broad enforcement powers over national banks, including the power to impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties and to appoint a conservator or receiver if any of a number of conditions are met.
The CFPB regulates consumer financial products and services provided by Park National Bank through regulations designed to protect consumers.
Federal Deposit Insurance 
The FDIC is an independent federal agency which insures the deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally-insured banks and savings associations and safeguards the safety and soundness of the financial institution industry. The general insurance limit is $250,000 per separately insured depositor. This insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.
As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by insured institutions, including Park National Bank, to prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines to pose a threat to the DIF, and to take enforcement actions against insured institutions. The FDIC may terminate insurance of deposits of any insured institution if the FDIC finds that the insured institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or any other regulatory agency. 
The FDIC assesses quarterly deposit insurance premiums on each insured institution based on risk characteristics of the insured institution and may also impose special assessments in emergency situations. The premiums fund the DIF. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio ("DRR"), which is the amount in the DIF as a percentage of all DIF insured deposits. In March 2016, the FDIC adopted final rules designed to meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on insured institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. Although the FDIC's new rules reduced assessment rates on all banks, they imposed a surcharge on banks with assets of $10 billion or more to be paid until the DRR reaches 1.35%. The DRR reached 1.36% at September 30, 2018. The rules also provide assessment credits to banks with assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their assessments that contribute to the increase of the DRR to 1.35%. Such credits will be applied when the DRR is at least 1.38%. The rules further changed the method of determining risk-based assessment rates for 
-12-

established banks with less than $10 billion in assets to better ensure that banks taking on greater risks pay more for deposit insurance than banks that take on less risk. 
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, which was established by the government to recapitalize a predecessor to the DIF. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in September 2019. The Financing Corporation has projected that the last assessment will be collected on the March 29, 2019 FDIC invoice.    
Federal Home Loan Bank
The Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) provide credit to their members in the form of advances. Park National Bank is a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati. As an FHLB member, Park National Bank must maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB of Cincinnati. 
Upon the origination or renewal of a loan or advance, each FHLB is required by law to obtain and maintain a security interest in certain types of collateral. Each FHLB is required to establish standards of community investment or service that its members must maintain for continued access to long-term advances from the FHLB. The standards take into account a member’s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act and the member’s record of lending to first-time home buyers.
Regulatory Capital
The Federal Reserve Board has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for financial holding companies and other bank holding companies as well as state member banks. The OCC and the FDIC have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for national banks and state non-member banks, respectively. The guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework which makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy, and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Capital levels as measured by these standards are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions.
The risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies are based on the “International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standard” (Basel I), published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”). In July 2013, the United States banking regulators issued new capital rules applicable to smaller banking organizations which also implement certain of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Capital Rules”). Community banking organizations, including Park and Park National Bank, began transitioning to the new rules on January 1, 2015. The new minimum capital requirements became effective on January 1, 2015; while a new capital conservation buffer and deductions from common equity capital phased in from January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2019, and most deductions from common equity tier 1 capital phased in from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. 
The rules include (a) a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, (b) a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, (c) a minimum total capital ratio of 8.0%, and (d) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%.
Common equity for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio includes common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interests in the form of common stock, less the majority of certain regulatory deductions. 
Tier 1 capital includes common equity as defined for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, plus certain non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, cumulative preferred stock and related surplus and trust preferred securities that have been grandfathered (but which are not permitted going forward), and limited amounts of minority interests in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, less certain deductions.
Tier 2 capital, which can be included in the total capital ratio, includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debt) and limited amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to new eligibility criteria, less applicable deductions.
The deductions from common equity tier 1 capital include goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing assets above certain levels, gains on sale in connection with a securitization, investments in a banking organization’s own capital instruments and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (above certain levels). 
-13-

Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, one of several risk weights is applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
The rules also place restrictions on the payment of capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5 percent composed of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, or if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5 percent at the beginning of the quarter. The capital conservation buffer began to phase in starting on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% and, effective January 1, 2019, was fully phased in at 2.5%.
In September 2017, the Federal Reserve Board, along with other bank regulatory agencies, proposed amendments to its capital requirements to simplify aspects of the capital rules for community banks, including Park National Bank, in an attempt to reduce the regulatory burden for such smaller financial institutions. In November 2017, the federal banking agencies extended for community banks the existing capital requirements for certain items that were scheduled to change effective January 1, 2018, in light of the simplification amendments being considered, including extending the existing capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets and certain other items. The intent is to prevent different rules from taking effect while the banking regulatory agencies consider a broader simplification of the capital rules. As described above, the bank regulatory agencies have proposed revised capital requirements under the Regulatory Relief Act.

The federal banking agencies have established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve certain of the problems of undercapitalized depository institutions. This system is based on five capital level categories for insured depository institutions: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.”
The federal banking agencies may (or in some cases must) take certain supervisory actions depending upon a bank’s capital level. For example, the banking agencies must appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank within 90 days after the bank becomes “critically undercapitalized” unless the bank’s primary regulator determines, with the concurrence of the FDIC, that other action would better achieve regulatory purposes. Banking operations otherwise may be significantly affected depending on a bank’s capital category. For example, a bank that is not “well capitalized” generally is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market, and the holding company of any undercapitalized depository institution must guarantee, in part, specific aspects of the bank’s capital plan for the plan to be acceptable.
In order to be “well-capitalized,” a bank must have a common equity tier I capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a total risk-based capital of at least 10.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0% and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and the bank must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Park’s management believes that Park National Bank meets the ratio requirements to be deemed “well-capitalized” according to the guidelines described above. See Note 27 - Capital Ratios of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Park’s 2018 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Fiscal and Monetary Policies
The business and earnings of Park and its subsidiaries are affected significantly by the fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. Park National Bank is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. These policies are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.
Limits on Dividends and Other Payments
There are various legal limitations on the extent to which a subsidiary bank may finance or otherwise supply funds to its parent holding company. Under applicable federal and state laws, a subsidiary bank may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, make loans or extensions of credit to, or investments in the securities of, its parent holding company. A subsidiary bank is also subject to collateral security requirements for any loan or extension of credit permitted by such exceptions.
-14-

The ability of Park to obtain funds for the payment of dividends and for other cash requirements is largely dependent on the amount of dividends which may be declared by Park National Bank. However, the Federal Reserve Board expects Park to serve as a source of strength to Park National Bank, which may require Park to retain capital for further investment in Park National Bank, rather than pay dividends to the Park shareholders. 
Park National Bank may not pay dividends out of its surplus if, after paying these dividends, it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under the capital guidelines established by the OCC and the capital conservation buffer. In addition, Park National Bank must have the approval of the OCC if a dividend in any year would cause the total dividends for that year to exceed the sum of Park National Bank’s current year’s net income and the retained net income for the preceding two years, less required transfers to surplus. Payment of dividends by Park National Bank may be restricted at any time at the discretion of its regulatory authorities, if such regulatory authorities deem such dividends to constitute unsafe and/or unsound banking practices or if necessary to maintain adequate capital. These provisions could have the effect of limiting Park’s ability to pay dividends on Park's common shares.
At December 31, 2018, approximately $86.2 million of the total shareholders’ equity of Park National Bank was available for payment to Park without the approval of the OCC. See Note 23 - Dividend Restrictions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Park’s 2018 Annual Report.
The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by financial holding companies and other bank holding companies. The policy statement provides that, as a matter of prudent banking, a financial holding company or bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the financial holding company or bank holding company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Accordingly, a financial holding company or bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the financial holding company or bank holding company’s financial health, such as by borrowing.
Under the terms of the Indenture governing the $15.5 million of junior subordinated notes issued by Vision to the Vision Trust and the related Guarantee Agreement, Park, as successor to Vision in accordance with the First Supplemental Indenture, is prohibited, subject to limited exceptions, from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on any shares of its capital stock (i) if an event of default under the Indenture has occurred and continues, (ii) if Park is in default with respect to the payment of any obligations under the Guarantee Agreement or (iii) during any period in which the payment of interest on the junior subordinated notes by Park (and the payment of cash distributions on the floating rate preferred securities of the Vision Trust) is being deferred.
Volcker Rule
In December 2013, five federal agencies adopted a final regulation implementing the Volcker Rule provision of the Dodd-Frank Act (the "Volcker Rule"). The Volcker Rule places limits on the trading activity of insured depository institutions and entities affiliated with a depository institution, subject to certain exceptions. The trading activity includes a purchase or sale as principal of a security, derivative, commodity future or option on any such instrument in order to benefit from short-term price movements or to realize short-term profits. The Volcker Rule exempts specified United States government, agency and/or municipal obligations, and it excepts trading conducted in certain capacities, including as a broker or other agent, through a deferred compensation or pension plan, as a fiduciary on behalf of customers, to satisfy a debt previously contracted, repurchase and securities lending agreements and risk-mitigating hedging activities. 
The Volcker Rule also prohibits a banking entity from having an ownership interest in, or certain relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund, with a number of exceptions. To the extent that Park National Bank engages in any of the trading activities or has any ownership interest in or relationship with any of the types of funds regulated by the Volcker Rule, Park National Bank believes that its activities and relationships fall within the scope of the one or more of the exceptions provided in the Volcker Rule. 
The Regulatory Relief Act exempts banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less and total trading assets and liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets from the restrictions of the Volcker Rule. The federal banking regulators have proposed regulations to exempt community banks from the Volcker Rule and have stated that they will no longer enforce the Volcker Rule with respect to community banks while the rulemaking is being finalized.

Privacy Provisions
Federal and state regulations limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party.
Patriot Act
In response to the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) was signed into law in October 2001. The Patriot Act gives the United States government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. Title III of the Patriot Act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions. Among other requirements, Title III and related regulations require regulated financial institutions to establish a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts and establish enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report suspicious activity. Park National Bank has established policies and procedures that are believed to be compliant with the requirements of the Patriot Act.
Community Reinvestment Act
The Community Reinvestment Act requires Park National Bank's primary federal regulatory agency, the OCC, to assess Park National Bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by Park National Bank. The OCC assigns one of four ratings: outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve or substantial noncompliance. The rating assigned to a financial institution is considered in connection with various applications submitted by the financial institution or its holding company to its banking regulators, including applications to acquire another financial institution or to open or close a branch office. In addition, all subsidiary banks of a financial holding company must maintain a satisfactory or outstanding rating in order for the financial holding company to avoid limitations on its activities.
Corporate Governance
As mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC has adopted rules and regulations governing, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. NYSE AMERICAN has also adopted corporate governance rules. The Board of Directors of Park has taken a series of actions to strengthen and improve Park’s already strong corporate governance practices in light of the rules of the SEC and NYSE AMERICAN. The Board of Directors has adopted charters for the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Executive Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (including as Exhibit A thereto, Corporate Governance Guidelines) and the Risk Committee as well as a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics governing the directors, officers and associates of Park and its affiliates.
Executive and Incentive Compensation
In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC issued joint interagency guidance on incentive compensation policies (the “Joint Guidance”) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such banking organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. This principles-based guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of a banking organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should: (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the banking organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the banking organization’s board of directors.
In 2011, federal banking regulatory agencies jointly issued proposed rules on incentive-based compensation arrangements under applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “First Proposed Joint Rules”). The First Proposed Joint Rules generally would have applied to financial institutions with $1 billion or more in assets that maintain incentive-based compensation arrangements for certain covered employees. 
-16-

In May 2016, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved a second joint notice of proposed rules (the “Second Proposed Joint Rules”) designed to prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at financial institutions. The Second Proposed Joint Rules would apply to covered financial institutions with total assets of $1 billion or more. The requirements of the Second Proposed Joint Rules would differ for each of three categories of financial institutions: 

• | Level 1 consists of institutions with assets of $250 billion or more;


• | Level 2 consists of institutions with assets of at least $50 billion and less than $250 billion; and


• | Level 3 consists of institutions with assets of at least $1 billion and less than $50 billion.

Some of the requirements would apply only to Level 1 and Level 2 institutions. For all covered institutions, including Level 3 institutions like Park National Bank, the Second Proposed Joint Rules would:

• | prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that are “excessive” or “could lead to material financial loss;”


• | require incentive-based compensation that is consistent with a balance of risk and reward, effective management and control of risk, and effective governance; and


• | require board oversight, recordkeeping and disclosure to the appropriate regulatory agency.

Level 1 and Level 2 institutions would have additional requirements, including deferrals of awards to certain covered persons; potential downward adjustments, forfeitures or clawbacks; and additional risk-management and control standards, policies and procedures. In addition, certain practices and types of incentive compensation would be prohibited.
Public company compensation committee members must meet heightened independence requirements and consider the independence of compensation consultants, legal counsel and other advisors to the compensation committee. A compensation committee must have the authority to hire advisors and to have the public company fund reasonable compensation of such advisors.
SEC regulations require public companies to provide various disclosures about executive compensation in annual reports and proxy statements and to present to their shareholders a non-binding vote on the approval of executive compensation.
Public companies will be required, once stock exchanges impose additional listing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, to implement "clawback" procedures for incentive compensation payments and to disclose the details of the procedures which allow recovery of incentive compensation that was paid on the basis of erroneous financial information necessitating a restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. This clawback policy is intended to apply to compensation paid within a three-year look-back window of the restatement and would cover all executives who received incentive awards.
Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations
Banks are subject to regular examination to ensure compliance with federal consumer protection statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, the following:

• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act (prohibiting discrimination in any credit transaction on the basis of any of various criteria)


• | Truth in Lending Act (requiring that credit terms are disclosed in a manner that permits a consumer to understand and compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably)


• | Fair Housing Act (making it unlawful for a lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person on the basis of certain criteria)

-17-


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (requiring financial institutions to collect data that enables regulatory agencies to determine whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the communities in which they are located)


• | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (requiring that lenders provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements and prohibits abusive practices that increase borrowers' costs)


• | Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (requiring financial institutions to establish policies and procedures to restrict the sharing of non-public customer data with non-affiliated parties and to protect customer information from unauthorized access)

The banking regulators also use their authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices by banks that may not necessarily fall within the scope of a specific banking or consumer finance law. 
                In October 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule (the "Payday Rule") with respect to certain consumer loans to be effective on January 16, 2018, although compliance with most sections is not required until August 19, 2019. The first major part of the rule makes it an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make short-term and longer-term loans with balloon payments (with certain exceptions) without reasonably determining that the borrower has the ability to repay the loan.  The second major part of the rule applies to the same types of loans as well as longer-term loans with an annual percentage rate greater than 36 percent that are repaid directly from the borrower's account.  The rule states that it is an unfair and abusive practice for the lender to withdraw payment from the borrower's account after two consecutive payment attempts have failed, unless the lender obtains the consumer's new and specific authorization to make further withdrawals from the account.  The rule also requires lenders to provide certain notices to the borrower before attempting to withdraw payment on a covered loan from the borrower's account.  

On February 6, 2019, the CFPB issued two proposals with respect to the Payday Rule. First, the CFPB proposed to delay the compliance date for the mandatory underwriting provisions of the Payday Rule to November 19, 2020. The CFPB has requested comments on the proposed delay to be made within 30 days. Second, the CFPB proposed to rescind provisions of the Payday Rule that (1) provide that it is an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make a covered short-term or longer-term balloon-payment loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan according to its terms; (2) prescribe mandatory underwriting requirements for making the ability-to-repay determination; (3) provide exemptions of certain loans from the mandatory underwriting requirements; and (4) provide related definitions, reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The CFPB has requested comments to be made within 90 days on this proposal. These proposals do not change the provisions of the Payday Rule that address lender payment practices with respect to covered loans. The CFPB also stated that the CFPB will be considering other changes to the Payday Rule in response to requests received for exemptions of certain types of lenders or loan products and may commence separate additional rulemaking initiatives.
Park does not currently expect the new rules to have a material effect on Park's financial condition or results of operations on a consolidated basis. 
As a consumer finance company incorporated under Ohio law, Guardian Finance is subject to regulation and supervision by the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions. Division regulation and supervision designed to protect consumers affect the lending activities of Guardian Finance, including interest rates and certain loan terms, advertising and record retention. If grounds provided by law exist, the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions may suspend or revoke an Ohio consumer finance company’s ability to make loans.
A new Ohio law enacted in 2018 but which will not apply to loans made before April 27, 2019, places numerous restrictions on short-term and small loans extended by certain Ohio-chartered lenders, including Guardian Finance. Park is still attempting to determine the effect of the law on Guardian Finance, including the loans that would no longer be offered and the increase in expenses of loans offered. Park believes at this time, however, that the effect will not be material to Park on a consolidated basis.

Effect of Environmental Regulation
Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of Park and its subsidiaries. Park believes the nature of the operations of its subsidiaries has little, if any, environmental impact. Park, therefore, anticipates no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for Park's current fiscal year or for the foreseeable future.
Park believes its primary exposure to environmental risk is through the lending activities of its subsidiaries. In cases where management believes environmental risk potentially exists, Park’s subsidiaries mitigate their environmental risk exposures by requiring environmental site assessments at the time of loan origination to confirm collateral quality as to commercial real estate parcels posing higher than normal potential for environmental impact, as determined by reference to present and past uses of the subject property and adjacent sites. In addition, environmental assessments are typically required prior to any foreclosure activity involving non-residential real estate collateral.
