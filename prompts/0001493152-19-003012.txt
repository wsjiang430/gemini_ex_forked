ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

Data Call Technologies, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada as Data Call Wireless, Inc. on April 4, 2002, and is sometimes referred to herein as “we”, “us”, “our”, “Data Call” or the “Company.” On March 1, 2006, we changed our name to Data Call Technologies, Inc. Since our inception, we have been engaged in the business of offering real-time information/content via digital signage and kiosk networks to our clients, who we consider to be our partners rather than simply as customers.
 
Our mission is to continue to exponentially grow our offering of our proprietary subscription services by integrating cutting-edge information/content delivery solutions to and within the control of retail and commercial resellers CMS manufacturers and end-users. Our Company’s services put its clients in control of real-time news, sports, weather and other dynamic content, displayed within one or multiple locations, spanning from local, regional to global end points, through Digital Signage and Kiosk networks.
 
Our business plan continues to focus on growing our client base by effectively offering this real-time and licensed information/content displayed through Digital Signage and Kiosk networks, seeking to improve the delivery, security, and variety of information/content services to the growing Digital Signage and Kiosk community.
 
Overview - What Is Digital Signage?
 
You’ve seen Digital Signage, it’s everywhere. Whether you’re shopping, trying to find your way through the airport, in a taxi, or even along the highway on your way home, it’s there. LED and LCD displays are continually replacing printed marketing materials such as signs and placards, as well as the old-school whiteboard, for product and corporate branding, marketing and assisted selling. The appeal of instantly updating product videos and promotional messages on one or thousands of remotely located displays is driving the adoption of this growing marketing platform. Digital Signage presentations are typically comprised of repeating loops (playlists) of information used to brand, market or sell the owner’s products and services or corporate messaging. But once viewed, this information becomes repetitive and the viewer tunes it out, resulting in low retention of the client’s message. As digital signage has matured, the characteristics of the digital signage presentations have taken center-stage requiring fresh, relevant and dynamic content mixed within the marketing messages. Dynamic Content is key.
Digital Signage Matures
 
We are experiencing the Digital Signage Industry (back then called connected signage) steadily maturing and Data Call, through its multiple industry specific relationships, continues its engagement and influence in the direction of the Digital Signage industry. Data Call has been performing in this space for well over a decade. Our company has staked claim in assisting the industry’s birth and maintains its prime position to enjoy and benefit from this industry’s growth.

Early on, a business desiring to achieve commercial benefits from the use of digital signage was often confronted by a plethora of hardware and software solutions, all offering their own “standard” of what digital signage should be. Typical customers for digital signage were most-often offered expensive hardware to present digital signage with a very minimalistic content management solution (CMS), lacking the full package of content with which to build and tailor their systems for their target customer base.
 
Those early adopters of digital signage, often had to realize that their digital signage hardware vendors lacked the acumen to fully provide best practice of content strategy. The tools to manage content were provided, but not the content. From our inception, Data Call recognized that early signage providers and their typical customers lacked that key component - the offering of a comprehensive content package.
 
As the cost of platforms supporting infrastructure and digital displays have fallen significantly, digital signage has become more accessible to a wider range of potential users. Companies in our industry have come to understand, as we have preached since our inception, that the cost of Data Call’s integrated, content-flexible subscription service is extremely cost effective - and licensed for redistribution over their networks. The benefit that Data Call continues to provide our client base, in the form of ongoing content development, is expected to continue to provide our customers with desirable user-friendly content and content services.
 
The Need for Speed - Active Content
 
Active and dynamic content is the integral part of digital signage presentations that must be constantly updated with timely and relevant information to attract and retain target viewers to the products, services, or messaging offered by typical Digital Signage clients. For instance, a typical presentation may contain ten 15-second loops that provide the primary message of the presentation, but the active dynamic content, such as that provided by Data Call, is updated with new information constantly throughout the day. Those seeking to add active and dynamic content to their digital signage presentations are educated and advised to subscribe to Data Call’s dynamic content rather than attempting to illegally “cut and paste” or “scrape” broadcast content or RSS Feeds “not for commercial use” of others into their digital signage presentation.
 
By integrating Data Call’s content as a meaningful component of digital signage presentations, our clients can legally provide the entertainment and information content necessary to enhance the target customer’s information retention without disrupting the core message of the presentation. Some of the Infotainment categories provided by Data Call include news, sports, weather, financial data, the latest traffic alerts, among many others. With such a broad range of offerings, our clients have access to this active and dynamic content they need, regardless of the target customers and market they are addressing.
 
Our Business Opportunities
 
Our many opportunities for client development in the digital signage industry are growing exponentially. While many companies in our industry have traditionally outsourced all or part of their content creation, Data Call serves as a provider of dynamic active content to clients on a tailored basis. Whether a client desires general entertainment information for customers, such as news, sports, stock market quotes, etc. or location-specific content, such as local weather, traffic, etc., our research and experience has validated our long-held mantra that dynamic content draws and retains our clients’ target viewers to their digital signage and keeps viewers engaged throughout the client presentation.
 
Since our inception, management has developed and maintains strong relationships working with the leaders and associations of the digital signage industry. Collaborative efforts have successfully created, now industry standard, data formats and methods to facilitate the delivery of our dynamic content more easily and efficiently for integration into most hardware and software products.

Partners, Not Customers
 
Data Call’s enduring approach to our clients is to build long-lasting partnerships by creating client relationships that we believe are unique in the digital signage industry. We understand that each client has their own content requirements. In developing dynamic content for individual digital signage clients, we have identified three content-related factors: (i) reliability; (ii) objectivity; and (iii) ease of implementation. To address the reliability requirement, we are engaged in multiple license arrangements with the leading providers of news, weather, sports and financial information, among other client-desired content rather than either: (i) downloading and repackaging content sourced from the Internet (which may be illegal); or (ii) Scraping RSS feeds from news organizations (which may come and go at the provider’s whim - not to mention this practice is also illegal).
 
Licensing data from these premier providers has also served us by satisfying the second criteria, objectivity. Because it is commonly recognized that Internet content may often be unreliable, unverifiable and biased, early on, we determined that we could not simply use unfiltered Internet content for delivery to our clients. Our proper licensing of data facilitates the standard of delivery and implementation by our client/partners. Data Call does the heavy lifting by taking care of not just the licensing, but the proper formatting of that data for consumption by the industry utilizing our multiple formats offered. Data Call has understood that it’s Digital Signage and Kiosk clients needed a more complete service than to endeavor the sourcing of active content from multiple vendors. As a result, our flexible content plans permit our clients to do “one stop shopping” for all dynamic content requirements by licensing subscriptions through us.
 
We empower our clients to receive customized dynamic content subscriptions to be displayed in a multitude of ways (banners, tickers, scrolls or visualizations integrated with the overall presentations). We have created “Playlist Ready” offerings and produced and distribute multiple sets of common data layouts in the industry-standard formats such as XML (extensible markup language), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), RSS (Rich Site Summary, often called Really Simple Syndication), MRSS (Media RSS) and MPEG (Moving Pictures Expert Group). With the advent of HTML5 (5th version of Hypertext Markup Language), even more delivery methods have been made available to our clients, many of whom have found any one or a combination of these formats to be easily integrated into their products. Nevertheless, we have also produced customized data formats and visualizations to the exact and specific requirements of our clients/partners, which, we believe ensures a higher level of reliability and ease of implementation.
 
Market demand, opportunity and technology converge at a single point in time, and Data Call continues hold its position. Our integrity persistently builds our business. Digital signage platforms steadily evolve to meet mass market requirements, costs for hardware and software are falling to the point of becoming commodities and the markets for digital signage are clarifying through historical trial and error.
 
Business Operations
 
March of 2017, we released our Direct Lynk Manager (DLManager) customer portal at the Digital Signage Expo in Las Vegas. The DLManager incorporates In the Direct Lynk Media platform with major enhancements and options that enable the client to self-serve in a webstore environment. This is a moderated space that allows proper “white glove” treatment by our staff that our clients have come to expect and appreciate. Once the client is comfortable with navigation of the portal, they may then set up multiple groups and displays within their account for testing results in a demo fashion free of charge. Upon completion of their content selections and distribution points, the client may purchase the proper number of licenses needed to support their sections through various plans offered within the portal.
 
Some of the current types of data and information, for which a client may subscribe to through the Direct Lynk System, in multiple formats include:
 

● | Headline News - top world and national news headlines; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

We continually add different types of content per client requests. We provide our DLM services to our clients and other potential customers through the Internet. All DLM Services are real-time information services providing a wide range of up-to-date information for display. These services are designed to work concurrently with customers’ existing digital signage systems. The Direct Lynk Messenger product is scheduled to be sunset within the next 12 months, as DLMedia gradually moves into a legacy status with the DLManager portal taking the forefront.
 
Since our inception in 2002, we have come to deeply understand that this industry provides an exciting platform for advertisers, including our clients, to promote, inform, educate, and entertain their customers and employees regarding their business products, services, and corporate communications. Through Digital Signage, and Digital Out of Home (DOOH) businesses can use a single display or a complex, networked series of displays and video walls to market their products and services directly at their facilities and elsewhere to their customers and employees in real time. Additionally, because the core of Digital Signage advertising takes place in real time, businesses can change their marketing and messaging efforts literally from moment to moment and over the course of a day or such other period as they may determine.
 
We believe that the ability of our clients to display in real-time, the information and content we deliver, better allows our clients to tailor their products, services, advertising and messaging to individual and target-group customers, thereby advertising and offering, for example, inventory and sales discounts that may be designed to appeal to those individual customers and target customer groups, increasing sales and revenues. We believe that the benefits of on-site, real-time Digital Signage displays compared to regular print or video advertising are substantial and include, among other advantages, being able to immediately change digitally-displayed images/advertisements depending on our client’s customers own situation, not simply being restricted by in-store print circulars produced days, weeks or even months in advance, which may become stale or obsolete prior to or shortly after publication and dissemination.
 
We specialize in enabling our clients to create their own Digital Signage content feeds which are delivered online directly to their chosen, electronic digital display devices at their various facilities. The only requirements our clients must have are: (i) a supported, third-party Digital Signage or Kiosk equipment solution - through a CMS or a standalone player, or similar device, which receives the data from our servers online; and (ii) an Internet connection. Our DLM System is supported by various, readily available third-party systems, varying in costs from inexpensive monthly cloud-based licenses to much more extensive and expensive content management/playback systems. Our Systems allow customers to select from their pre-determined data and information subscriptions offered. We enable our clients to also select location specific content they wish to receive based on how and where their Digital Signage network is configured.

In December of 2017 the company completed the arduous task of reconstructing our back-end systems architecture. This task was initialized to exploit the latest technology advances within our space, utilizing our data center efficiencies to further streamline our processes. One of the greater culminations of this effort yielded the Data Call API (Application Programming Interface) allowing our enterprise channel partners to embed our products within their offerings to further widen our reach.
 
Data Call continues to grow its client base through relationships that are gained through industry events such as seminars and trade shows. Our company has become a leader in syndicated content and custom content development for Digital Signage. Our licensed content is utilized on thousands of screens in hundreds of deployments. We are truly excited of our continued growth through our resellers, CMS manufacturers and end users.
 
Dependence On A Few Major Customers
 
At December 31, 2018, we had customer/subscribers for our Direct Lynk System, which customers are relatively small, paying cumulatively an average monthly fee to Data Call of up to $1,000. We also have several larger new potential partner/clients that are testing our Digital Link Media products, and we expect that some or all of them may be expected to become significant clients in the near future. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we were dependent upon two major customers, who accounted for approximately 74% of our revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we were dependent upon two major customers, who accounted for approximately 81% of our revenues.
 
Notwithstanding the forgoing, based upon recent communications with several potential clients who are volume users and/or wholesale distributors of digital signage content and content management systems, we believe that during 2019, several new clients will contribute significant revenue which should materially reduce our reliance on our three major customers to less than 50%. As a result, we believe that that we should become far less reliant on a few business clients for our source of revenue. However, there can be no assurance that our belief will prove to be justified or, if justified, that such trend will continue for any future period, if at all.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we had 4 full-time employees, including our two executive officers. Depending upon our level of our growth, if any, we expect that we may or will be required to hire additional personnel in the areas of sales and marketing, software design, research and development and otherwise, during 2018 and continuing into 2019. However, we will be dependent upon revenue growth and profitability, of which there can be no assurance, to fund any increase in staff. None of our employees are covered by a selective bargaining agreement
Estimate Of The Amount Spent On Research And Development Activities
 
Since our inception in April 2002, the majority of our expenditures have been on research and development to create our Direct Lynk Messenger Systems, including software and hardware development and testing costs. The amount spent on this research and development from inception through December 31, 2018 is approximately $3,000,000.
