ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
----------------------------------+---------

General 
 
Lipocine Inc. (“Lipocine” or the “Company”) was originally incorporated on June 19, 1997, under the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on leveraging our proprietary Lip’ral platform to develop differentiated products through the oral delivery of previously difficult to deliver molecules, focused on treating Central Nervous System (“CNS”) disorders. Our proprietary delivery technologies are designed to improve patient compliance and safety through orally available treatment options. Our primary development programs are based on oral delivery solutions for poorly bioavailable drugs. We have a portfolio of differentiated innovative product candidates that target high unmet needs for neurological and psychiatric CNS disorders, liver diseases, and hormone supplementation for men and women.
 
We entered into a license agreement for the development and commercialization of our product candidate, TLANDO®, an oral testosterone replacement therapy (“TRT”) comprised of testosterone undecanoate (“TU”). TLANDO is a registered trademark assigned to Antares. On October 14, 2021, we entered into the license agreement (the “Antares License Agreement”) with Antares Pharma, Inc. (“Antares” or our “Licensee”), pursuant to which we granted to Antares an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license to develop and commercialize, upon final approval of TLANDO from the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the TLANDO product for TRT in the U.S. Any FDA required post-marketing studies will also be the responsibility of our licensee, Antares. On March 28, 2022, approval was received from the FDA for TLANDO as a TRT in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency of endogenous testosterone, also known as hypogonadism. On May 24, 2022, Halozyme Therapeutics (“Halozyme”) completed an acquisition of Antares Pharma Inc. through a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Halozyme with and into Antares, with Antares continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Halozyme. On June 7, 2022, Halozyme announced the commercial launch of TLANDO, an oral treatment indicated for TRT in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone (primary or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism).
 
Additional clinical development pipeline candidates include: LPCN 1154 for postpartum depression (“PPD”); LPCN 2101 for epilepsy; and LPCN 1148 comprising a novel prodrug of testosterone, testosterone laurate (“TL”), for the management of decompensated cirrhosis. In addition to our CNS product candidates, we have non-core assets for which we expect to seek partnerships to enable further development which we do not plan to devote significant resources to developing in the future without a partnership or out licensing agreement. These non-core assets include LPCN 1148 which we intend to explore partnering once completion of the Phase 2 study is complete, LPCN 1144, an oral prodrug of androgen receptor modulator for the treatment of non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) which has completed Phase 2 testing; LPCN 1111, a next generation oral TRT product comprised of testosterone tridecanoate (“TT”) with the potential for once daily dosing which has completed Phase 2 testing; and LPCN 1107, potentially the first oral hydroxy progesterone caproate (“HPC”) product indicated for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth (“PTB”), which has completed a dose finding clinical study in pregnant women and has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA.

Corporate Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on leveraging our proprietary Lip’ral drug delivery technology platform to develop differentiated products through oral delivery of previously difficult to deliver molecules for CNS disorders. The key components of our strategy are to:

5
-


Advance LPCN 1154 and other CNS product candidates. We intend to focus on the development of endogenous neuroactive steroids (“NAS”) which have broad applicability in treating various CNS conditions where we can leverage our technology platform to develop highly differentiated oral therapeutics. Our priority is on the development of LPCN 1154, a fast-acting oral antidepressant for postpartum depression (“PPD”) with potential for outpatient use.
 
Support our licensee in commercialization of our licensed oral TRT option. We believe the TRT market needs a differentiated, convenient oral option. We have exclusively licensed rights to TLANDO to Antares for commercialization of TLANDO in the US. We plan to support our licensee’s efforts to effectively enable the availability of TLANDO to patients in a timely manner, in addition to receiving milestone and royalty payments associated with TLANDO commercialization as agreed to in the Antares License Agreement.
 
Develop partnership(s) to continue the advancement of non-core pipeline assets. We continuously strive to prioritize our resources in seeking partnerships of our pipeline assets. We are currently exploring partnering (i) LPCN 1144, our candidate for treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH, (ii) LPCN 1148, for the management of decompensated cirrhosis, (iii) LPCN 1111, a once-a-day therapy candidate for TRT, and (iv) LPCN 1107, our candidate for prevention of pre-term birth. We are also exploring the possibility of licensing LPCN 1021 (known as TLANDO in the United States) to third parties outside the United States, although no licensing agreement has been entered into by the Company.
 
Our Development Pipeline Product Candidates
 
Our pipeline of clinical development candidates includes LPCN 1154 for postpartum depression (“PPD”), LPCN 2101 for epilepsy, and LPCN 1148, an androgen therapy for the management of cirrhosis. We will continue to explore other product development candidates targeting CNS indications with a significant unmet need. We will also continue efforts to enter into partnership arrangements for the continued development and/or marketing of LPCN 1144, LPCN 1148, LPCN 1111, LPCN 1107 and TLANDO outside of the United States.
 
Our products are based on our proprietary Lip’ral drug delivery technology platform. Lip’ral-based TLANDO was approved in March 2022. Lip’ral technology is a patented technology based on lipidic compositions which form an optimal dispersed phase in the gastrointestinal environment for improved absorption of insoluble drugs. The drug loaded dispersed phase presents the solubilized drug efficiently at the absorption site (gastrointestinal tract membrane) thus improving the absorption process and making the drug less dependent on physiological variables such as dilution, gastro-intestinal pH and food effects for absorption. Lip’ral-based formulation enables improved solubilization and higher drug-loading capacity, which can lead to improved bioavailability, reduced dose, faster and more consistent absorption, reduced variability, reduced sensitivity to food effects, improved patient compliance, and targeted lymphatic delivery where appropriate.
 
Oral Programs for CNS Disorders
 
Some preferred endogenous or naturally occurring NAS present in central nervous system act as positive allosteric modulators (“PAM”) of the GABAA receptor, the major biological target of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (“GABAA”). To improve oral delivery of these modulators, several synthetic NAS derivatives of endogenous GABAA receptor PAMs, have been developed for therapeutic use in the past few decades.
 
We believe through utilization of our proprietary technology we may have the ability to enable effective oral delivery of endogenous GABAA receptor PAMs which historically had been deemed to be not orally bioavailable. As a novel drug class, NAS have received considerable attention because of their potential to treat various neuropsychiatric conditions including depression, movement disorders, epilepsy, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases. We have conducted Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (“PK”) studies for each of our two lead NAS candidates which have demonstrated promising PK results, safety, and tolerability and we are evaluating additional undisclosed CNS-focused candidates.
 
LPCN 1154: Product Candidate for PPD 
 
Our most advanced NAS candidate is LPCN 1154, a non-invasive, oral formulation of the neuroactive steroid brexanolone which we are developing for the treatment of PPD. The FDA recently agreed with our proposal for establishing the efficacy of LPCN 1154 through a pivotal PK bridge to an approved IV infusion brexanolone via a 505(b)(2) NDA filing. Based on feedback from the FDA, the company has initiated a pilot PK bridge study of LPCN 1154, a prelude to a pivotal study required for NDA filing, and results from the pilot PK bridge study are expected in the first half of 2023. We have previously completed an oral PK study and a food effect study with LPCN 1154.

PPD
 
PPD (“Postpartum depression”), a type of major depressive disorder with onset either during pregnancy or within four weeks of delivery, refers to depression persisting up to 12 months after childbirth. PPD can be clinically segmented by the severity of symptoms and presence of a comorbidity, including epilepsy. Approximately 1 in 8 mothers suffers from PPD in the United States alone; this equates to approximately 500,000 women being affected by PPD annually.
Disease Overview - PPD
 

● | PPD is distinct from the “baby blues,” a condition that up to 70% of all new mother’s experience; “baby blues” tend to be short-lived emotional conditions that do not interfere with daily activities. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Symptoms of PPD include hallmarks of major depression, including, but not limited to, sadness, depressed mood, loss of interest, change in appetite, insomnia, sleeping too much, fatigue, difficulty thinking/concentrating, excessive crying, fear of harming the baby/oneself, and/or thoughts of death or suicide. 
● | During pregnancy, levels of endogenous NAS increase considerably along with levels of progesterone; however, they drop sharply postpartum. It has been hypothesized that the rapid perinatal decrease in circulating levels of endogenous NASs may be involved in the development of PPD. The first and only approved treatment option for PPD is an injectable containing endogenous NAS. 
● | Depression may persist long after child delivery. Additionally, approximately 40% of women relapse in subsequent pregnancies or on other occasions. 
● | Psychiatric comorbidities are common in patients with epilepsy. Patients with epilepsy are at high risk for major depressive disorders and PPD. Reported PPD rates are higher among women with epilepsy than the general population. 

Associated Risk Factors
 

● | Genetic: family history and/or previous experience of depression or other mood disorders 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Physiological: rapid changes in sex hormones, stress hormones, and thyroid hormone levels during and after delivery 
● | Environmental: stressful life events, changes in relationships at home and at work, and/or lack of familial support 

Unmet Medical Need 
 
We believe there is considerable unmet need within women with PPD due to lack of convenient and fast-acting oral therapies. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (“SSRIs”) have been the traditional first-line choice for women with severe PPD requiring weeks for onset of efficacy; therefore, a need for an oral treatment option with a faster onset of action remains a significant unmet need in treating PPD, especially in women with epilepsy risk wherein psychiatric comorbidity is common and PPD rates are higher than the general population.
 
Injectable brexanolone (Zulresso™, Sage Therapeutics) became the first FDA-approved treatment for postpartum depression. However, numerous factors limit the utilization of injectable brexanolone such as method of administration, cost, and safety concerns. Administration of injectable brexanolone requires a 60-hour continuous infusion in a supervised medical setting, a demanding ask for a mother with a newborn. Besides associated privacy concerns and social stigma, inpatient treatment may also require separation of the mother and child for a few days, which may be difficult to the already strained mother-infant bond and may present breast feeding challenges. Moreover, the pharmacotherapy costs coupled with inpatient treatment/childcare costs limits its accessibility and affordability to women most in need of the therapy. Finally, due to concerns about the safety of injectable Zulresso including excessive sedation or loss of consciousness, Zulresso has a Black Box Warning in its label and is only available through a restricted distribution program (REMS), and sites need significant time to become treatment ready.
 
We believe LPCN 1154 targets the unmet need for a convenient oral treatment with faster onset of action or rapid relief.

LPCN 2101: NAS for Epilepsy 
 
We are currently evaluating an additional NAS candidate, LPCN 2101, for women with epilepsy (“WWE”). We have completed pre-clinical and Phase 1 studies for LPCN 2101 which demonstrated promising PK results, safety and tolerability. In July 2022 our IND was accepted by the FDA for LPCN 2101 for adults with epilepsy and we plan to initiate a Phase 2 IND opening proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LPCN 2101 in 2023 subject to the availability of additional resources.
 
Disease Overview – Epilepsy
 
Epilepsy is defined by the 1) occurrence of at least two unprovoked seizures more than 24 hours apart, 2) occurrence of one unprovoked seizure and a probability of further seizures occurring over the next 10 years, and/or 3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Patients with epilepsy are more likely to be comorbid with other conditions, including depression and anxiety.
 
Patients with epilepsy have increased risk of mortality due to direct effects of seizures (e.g., status epilepticus, car accidents) and indirect effects of seizures (e.g., suicide, cardiovascular effects.)
 
Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain that causes seizures, affecting the physical, mental, and social well-being of persons, and is associated with a 2 to 3 times greater mortality rate compared with the general population. About 60-65% of epilepsy is idiopathic and about 30% of patients are refractory (i.e., epilepsy not well managed with currently available Anti-Seizure Medications (“ASMs”). Epilepsy is the most common neurological disorder during pregnancy.
 
It is estimated that approximately 900,000 child-bearing (“CB”) age women suffer from active epilepsy in the U.S. Women of CB age with epilepsy face many additional challenges due to hormonal influences on seizure activity and endocrine function throughout the different phases of their reproductive cycles. Elevated estrogen or decreased progesterone levels can exacerbate seizure frequency. Often, these women experience hormonal and endogenous NAS imbalances, coupled with fluctuations in the blood levels of ASMs that impact control of seizures, efficacy of oral contraceptives, any coexisting anxiety and/or depression and any associated sleep impairment. Epileptic patients are 5-20 times more likely to develop depression.
 
Clinical segmentation can be categorized by epilepsy type, comorbidities and patient subgroups. Categorization of focal epilepsy, generalized epilepsy, combined focal and generalized epilepsy, and unknown epilepsy can guide the choice of ASM. Special patient subgroups, including WWE of CB age and elderly patients, require special care and management of epilepsy. Comorbidities such as depression and anxiety may be co-treated with therapies that do not aggravate seizures and have no drug interaction with the ASM used for epilepsy. While lowest effective dose and monotherapy are preferred, management of patients with epilepsy is focused on controlling seizures, avoiding adverse events, and maintaining quality of life. Despite a wide range of ASMs available, about 30 % of all people with epilepsy still fail to respond to treatment effectively. Women with epilepsy face specific challenges throughout their lifespan because of seizures, ASMs, and hormonal fluctuations.
 
Women with epilepsy were once counseled to avoid pregnancy, but epilepsy is no longer considered a contraindication to pregnancy. Caregivers for WWE in the preconception phase either intending to start a family (planning pregnancy) or using contraception to prevent an unplanned pregnancy face significant challenges to balance seizure control efficacy with the selection and dosage of ASMs and ASM-related risks such as, among other risks, fetal-neonatal toxicity, contraception failure, and psychiatric side effects.
 
Several ASMs are known to have teratogenic effects on the developing fetus (converging evidence from registry studies indicates that teratogenic risks are highest with valproate, followed by carbamazepine and topiramate). Other commonly prescribed ASMs, including older generation agents, such as phenobarbital and phenytoin, have been associated with higher risks as compared with lamotrigine, levetiracetam, clonazepam and gabapentin (Vajda et al., 2014; Voinescu and Pennell, 2015). Moreover, risks associated with ASMs are considerable early in pregnancy; therefore, it is necessary that WWE of CB age undergo counseling, monitoring, and adjustment to the most appropriate ASM prior to becoming pregnant. It is preferable that WWE of CB age discuss seizure control with their doctor for at least 6 months before conception and, if possible, cease ASM therapy or use the lowest effective dose of a single anticonvulsant according to the type of epilepsy and the fetal toxicity of the ASM. Anxiety, depression, lack of adherence to ASM, and/or contraception failure may be experienced by women who are worried about unplanned pregnancy or are late in confirming pregnancy, planned or unplanned. ASMs can reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives, compounding this problem.
 
Complex, multidirectional interactions between female hormones, seizures, and ASMs exist. Most hormones act as NAS and can thus modulate brain excitability. Any changes in endogenous or exogenous hormone levels can affect the occurrence of seizures, either directly or via PK interactions that modify the plasma levels of ASMs (Harden, 2008). The PK interactions between oral contraceptives and ASMs are bidirectional (Johnston and Crawford, 2014). The efficacy of hormonal contraception may be diminished for women taking CYP-P450 enzyme inducing ASMs. Epilepsy is not a medical condition in which contraceptives are contraindicated. Contraceptive failure, possibly related to ASMs, may be responsible for up to 1 in 4 unplanned pregnancies in WWE (~12.5% of all WWE pregnancies), versus a rate of 1% in healthy women.

Unmet need to treat WWE in CB age
 
It is estimated that approximately 900,000 CB age women suffer from active epilepsy in the U.S. Women of CB age with epilepsy face many additional challenges such as hormonal influences on seizure activity and endocrine function throughout the different phases of their reproductive cycles, and approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy cannot be efficiently controlled with available ASMs making consideration of newer pharmacological treatment development options important.
 
Managing uncontrolled seizures in WWE of CB age is the primary aim during preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum phases. Therefore, uncompromised ASM efficacy with acceptable variability and less or no drug-drug interactions achieved with lowest possible monotherapy dose to address fetal toxicity concerns remain highly unmet needs. Moreover, control of seizures including prevention of breakthrough seizures is critical when planning for pregnancy and also during pregnancy, as it can also lead to undesired falls or auto-accidents and compromise freedom to drive.
 
Select ASMs have the potential to induce contraception failures, reproductive hormone imbalance, anxiety, and depression. There remains an unmet need for an ASM without the aforementioned downsides, with no to low fetal-neonatal toxicity and without any breast-feeding concerns as well as potential to treat associated comorbidities.
 
While over 30 molecules have been approved for the treatment of epilepsy in the U.S., no epilepsy drug has been specifically approved for WWE of CB age. We believe our endogenous NASs as GABAA PAMs, while targeting the goal of seizure control, also have the potential for additional benefits in psychiatric disorders comorbidities (e.g., anxiety and/or depression) and sleep impairment. Moreover, these oral endogenous NAS could potentially address some of the fetal toxicity concerns related to unplanned or planned pregnancy in WWE. (1)

LPCN 1148: Oral Product Candidate for the Management of Decompensated Cirrhosis 
 
We are currently evaluating LPCN 1148 comprising testosterone laurate (“TL”) for the management of decompensated cirrhosis. We believe LPCN 1148 targets unmet needs for subjects with cirrhosis including improvement in the quality of life of patients while on the liver transplant waiting list, prevention or reduction in the occurrence of new decompensation events such as hepatic encephalopathy (“HE”), and improvement in post liver transplant survival, including outcomes and costs.
 
We are currently conducting a Phase 2 proof of concept (“POC”) study (NCT04874350) in male cirrhotic subjects to evaluate the therapeutic potential of LPCN 1148 for the management of sarcopenia. The ongoing Phase 2 POC study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study in male sarcopenic cirrhotic patients. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 arms. The treatment arm is an oral dose of LPCN 1148, and the second arm is a matching placebo. The primary endpoint is change in skeletal muscle index at week 24 with key secondary endpoints including change in liver frailty index, rates of breakthrough HE, and number of waitlist events, including all-cause mortality. Total treatment is expected to be 52 weeks. Enrollment in the Phase 2 study was completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 and top-line 24-week results are expected in mid-2023.
 
Possible outcomes of interest from the Phase 2 study include clinical outcomes such as overall survival and new decompensation events (including HE and/or ascites occurrences), rates of survival to transplant, rates of hospitalizations, infections, etc., muscle changes such as muscle mass, body composition, myosteatosis (muscle fat), functional capacity changes such as liver frailty index (“LFI”), patient reported outcomes (“PROs”), and biochemical markers including hematocrit for anemia status, albumin, creatinine/kidney function, etc.
 
Disease Overview – Cirrhosis
 
There are over 2 million cases of cirrhosis worldwide, with over 500,000 people living with decompensated cirrhosis in the U.S. and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most rapidly increasing indication for liver transplant. 62% of those on the liver transplant (“LT”) waitlist are male and the economic burden (approximately $812,500/transplant) is high and continues to increase. Each year about half of the approximately 17,000 people in U.S. on the LT waitlist undergo transplant, while nearly 3,000 patients either die or are removed from the list because they were “too sick to transplant.”

Liver cirrhosis is defined as the histological development of regenerative nodules surrounded by fibrous bands. Cirrhotic patients typically have a years-long silent, asymptomatic phase (compensated cirrhosis) until decreasing liver function and increasing portal pressure move the patient into the symptomatic phase (decompensated cirrhosis). Transition to decompensated cirrhosis is marked by clinical events including ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice, and/or variceal hemorrhage. Decompensated subjects survive on average less than 2 years. Common causes of liver cirrhosis include alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”), chronic hepatitis B and C, primary biliary cirrhosis (“PBC”), primary sclerosing cholangitis (“PSC”) and cryptogenic.
 
Common complications in cirrhotic patients may include: compromised liver function, portal hypertension, varices in GI tract with internal bleeding, edema, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, compromised immunity with post-transplant acute rejection risk, high sodium levels, increased bilirubin, low albumin level, insulin resistance with impaired peripheral uptake of glucose, depression, accelerated muscle disorder in the form of sarcopenia, myosteotosis, and frailty with compromised energetics, bone diseases (e.g., osteoporosis), high alkaline phosphatase (“ALP”), cachexia, malnutrition, weight loss (>5%), symptoms of hypogonadism such as abnormal hair distribution, anemia, sexual dysfunction, testicular atrophy, muscle wasting, fatigue, osteoporosis, gynecomastia, inflammation with elevated cytokines, and infection risk leading to hospital admissions and possibly death.
 
HE, a significant decompensation event in patients with cirrhosis, is a brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portal systemic shunting. Because the damaged liver cannot function normally (as in cirrhosis), neurotoxins such as ammonia are inadequately removed from systemic circulation and travel to the brain, where they affect neurotransmission. This can cause episodes of HE, which may present as alterations in consciousness, cognition, and behavior that range from minimal to severe. Overt HE occurs in 30% to 40% of patients with cirrhosis at some point during the clinical course of their disease. As the burden of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is increasing, the frequency of HE is also increasing.
 
Our Partnership Pipeline Product Candidates
 
We continue to pursue opportunities for partnering arrangements for the continued development and/or marketing of LPCN 1144, LPCN 1148, LPCN 1111, LPCN 1107 and TLANDO outside of the U.S. We do not currently anticipate conducting any further significant development activities with respect to these products and product candidates, without the participation of a partner. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to identify or enter into partnering arrangements on terms that are beneficial to us or at all. Even if we do enter into partnering arrangements, such arrangements may not be sufficient to successfully develop and commercialize these products.
TLANDO: An Oral Product for Testosterone Replacement Therapy 
 
As previously described, under the Antares License Agreement, we granted to Antares an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license to develop and commercialize TLANDO, our product for TRT in the U.S. TLANDO received FDA approval on March 28, 2022. Any FDA requirement to conduct certain post-marketing studies will be the responsibility of our licensee, Antares. On May 24, 2022, Halozyme Therapeutics completed an acquisition of Antares Pharma Inc. through a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Halozyme with and into Antares, with Antares continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Halozyme.
 
Proof-of-concept for TLANDO was initially established in 2006, and subsequently TLANDO was licensed in 2009 to Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which was then acquired by Abbott Products, Inc. (“Abbott”). Following a portfolio review associated with the spin-off of AbbVie Inc. by Abbott in 2011, the rights to TLANDO were reacquired by us. All obligations under the prior license agreement have been completed except that Lipocine will owe Abbott a perpetual 1% royalty on net sales of TLANDO. Such royalties are limited to $1 million in the first 2 calendar years following product launch, after which period there is no cap on royalties and no maximum aggregate amount. If generic versions of any such product are introduced, then royalties are reduced by 50%. TLANDO was commercially launched on June 7, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred royalty expense of approximately $12,000 resulting from the commercial launch of TLANDO in 2022.
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), since TLANDO received full FDA approval, under the Antares Licensing Agreement Antares will need to address the PREA requirement to assess the safety and effectiveness of TLANDO in pediatric patients. The FDA may also require certain post-marketing studies to be conducted which will also be the responsibility of our licensee, Antares.
 
Upon execution of the Antares License Agreement, Antares paid us an initial payment of $11.0 million. Antares will also make additional payments of $5.0 million to us on each of January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2026, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. We are also eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $160.0 million in the aggregate, depending on the achievement of certain sales milestones in a single calendar year with respect to products licensed by Antares under the Antares License Agreement. In addition, we will receive tiered royalty payments at rates ranging from percentages in the mid-teens to up to 20% of net sales of TLANDO in the United States, subject to certain minimum royalty obligations. Further, on October 14, 2021, we assigned our Manufacturing Agreement, dated August 27, 2013, by and between the Company and Encap Drug Delivery (the “Manufacturing Agreement”) to Antares as part of the Antares License Agreement.

We are exploring the possibility of licensing LPCN 1021 (known as TLANDO in the United States) to third parties outside the United States, although no licensing agreement has been entered into by the Company. If and when an agreement is made with a partner, such arrangement would likely be contingent upon obtaining acceptable cost of goods by securing an agreement with a new manufacturer in addition to obtaining local regulatory approval. No assurance can be given that any license agreement will be completed, or, if an agreement is completed, that such an agreement would be on terms favorable to us.
 
LPCN 1144: An Oral Prodrug of Bioidentical Testosterone Product Candidate for the Treatment of NASH
 
We are exploring the possibility of partnering LPCN 1144 to a third party, although no partnering agreement has been entered into by the Company. No assurance can be given that any license agreement will be completed, or, if an agreement is completed, that such an agreement would be on terms favorable to us.
 
Disease Overview – NASH
 
NASH is a more advanced state of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”) and can progress to a cirrhotic liver or liver failure, require liver transplant, and can result in hepatocellular carcinoma/ liver cancer, and death. Progression of NASH to end stage liver disease will soon surpass all other causes of liver failure requiring liver transplantation. Importantly, beyond these critical conditions, NASH and NAFLD patients additionally suffer heightened cardiovascular risk and, in fact, die more frequently from cardiovascular events than from liver disease. NAFLD/NASH is becoming more common due to its strong correlation with obesity and metabolic syndrome, including components of metabolic syndrome such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. In the U.S., 20% to 30% of the population is estimated to suffer from NAFLD and 15% to 20% percent of this group progress to NASH, which is a substantially large population that lacks effective therapy. NASH is a silent killer that affects millions in the U.S. Diagnoses have been on the rise and are expected to increase dramatically in the next decade. Approximately 50% of NASH patients are in adult males. In men, especially with comorbidities associated with NAFLD/NASH, testosterone deficiency has been associated with an increased accumulation of visceral adipose tissue and insulin resistance, which could be factors contributing to NAFLD/NASH. There is currently no approved therapy for the treatment of NASH although there are several drug candidates currently under development with many having clinical failures to date.
 
The critical pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the development and progression of NASH include reduced ability to handle lipids, increased insulin resistance, injury to hepatocytes and liver fibrosis in response to hepatocyte injury. NASH patients have an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver resulting primarily from a caloric intake above and beyond energy needs. A healthy liver contains less than 5% fat, but a liver in someone with NASH can contain more than 20% fat. This abnormal liver fat contributes to the progression to NASH, a liver necro-inflammatory state that can lead to scarring, also known as fibrosis, and, for some, can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure.
 
Current Status
 
We have recently completed the LiFT Phase 2 clinical study in biopsy-confirmed non-cirrhotic NASH subjects. The LiFT clinical study was a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple-arm study in biopsy-confirmed hypogonadal and eugonadal male NASH subjects with grade F1-F3 fibrosis and a target NAFLD Activity Score ≥ 4 with a 36-week treatment period. The LiFT clinical study enrolled 56 biopsy confirmed NASH male subjects. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to one of three arms (Treatment A is a twice daily oral dose of 142 mg testosterone equivalent, Treatment B is a twice daily oral dose of 142 mg testosterone equivalent formulated with 217 mg of d-alpha tocopherol equivalent, and the third arm is twice daily matching placebo).
 
The primary endpoint of the LiFT clinical study was change in hepatic fat fraction via MRI-PDFF and exploratory liver fat/marker end points post 12 weeks of treatment. Additionally, key secondary endpoints post 36 weeks of treatment included assessment of histological change for NASH resolution and/or fibrosis improvement (biopsy) as well as liver fat data (MRI-PDFF). The LiFT clinical study was not powered to assess statistical significance of any of the secondary endpoints. Other important endpoints included the following: change in liver injury markers, anthropomorphic measurements, lipids, insulin resistance and inflammatory/fibrosis markers; as well as patient reported outcomes.

--


Treatments with LPCN 1144 post 12 weeks of treatment in the LiFT study resulted in robust liver fat reduction, assessed by MRI-PDFF, and showed improvement of liver injury markers with no observed tolerability issues.
 
Liver biopsies were performed at baseline (“BL”) and after 36 weeks of treatment (“EOS”). Prespecified biopsy analyses included NASH Clinical Research Network (“CRN”) scoring as well as a continuous paired (“Paired Technique”) and digital technique (“Digital Technique-Fibronest”). All biopsy analyses were performed on the same slides and the reads for the 3 techniques were done independently. Analysis sets included the NASH Resolution Set (all subjects that have BL and EOS biopsy with NASH at BL [NAS ≥4 with lobular inflammation score ≥ 1 and hepatocyte ballooning score ≥1 at BL] (n=37)), the Biopsy Set (all subjects with baseline and EOS biopsies (n=44)), and the Safety Set (all randomized subjects (n=56)).
 
Both LPCN 1144 treatment arms met with statistical significance the pre-specified accelerated approval regulatory endpoint of NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis based on NASH CRN scoring. Additionally, both treatment arms showed substantial improvement of the observed NASH activity in steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning.
 
During the 36 weeks of treatment, LPCN 1144 was well tolerated with an overall safety profile comparable to placebo. Additionally, subjects were given the option to have access to LPCN 1144 through an open label extension (“OLE”) study. The extension study enabled the collection of additional data on LPCN 1144 for up to a total of 72 weeks of therapy, as well as data for 36 weeks of therapy for those subjects on placebo in the LiFT study. Key results from the OLE study are as follows:
 

● | LPCN 1144 was well tolerated over 72-week exposure with no observed safety signals; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Liver injury markers were reduced and maintained with extended LPCN 1144 treatment; and 
● | Observed liver histology improvements support further development 

 
In November 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to LPCN 1144 as a treatment for non-cirrhotic NASH. The Fast Track program is designed to accelerate the development and expedite the review of products, such as LPCN 1144, which are intended to treat serious diseases and for which there is an unmet medical need.
 
We had a written only response from FDA for a LPCN 1144 Type C meeting with the FDA in January 2022 to discuss the development path forward with LPCN 1144. The FDA acknowledged that the NDA submission of LPCN 1144 would be via 505(b)2 regulatory pathway and agreed that no additional non-clinical studies are needed to support an NDA submission. The FDA acknowledged that in the LiFT study subjects achieved improvements in key components associated with NASH histopathology after 36-weeks of treatment with LPCN 1144 in adult males and agreed that the proposed multicomponent primary surrogate endpoint is acceptable for seeking approval under the accelerated approval pathway. The FDA agreed that the proposed primary multicomponent surrogate endpoint, NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis, is acceptable for seeking approval under the accelerated approval pathway and the FDA recommended a Phase 3 trial with a study duration of 72 weeks. In July 2022, Lipocine held an End of Phase 2 meeting with FDA for LPCN 1144 in NASH. The FDA recommended a Phase 2 dose ranging study be conducted to identify the optimal dose prior to conducting a pivotal study. The FDA agreed to the proposed unique testosterone ester, testosterone laurate, for future clinical studies.
 
LPCN 1111: A Next-Generation Long-Acting Oral Product Candidate for TRT
 
We are in the process of scaling up the manufacturing process and generation of supplies of LPCN 1111 to enable potential partners to conduct pivotal studies for registration. We are exploring the possibility of partnering LPCN 1111 to a third party, although no partnering agreement has been entered into by the Company. No assurance can be given that any license agreement will be completed, or, if an agreement is completed, that such an agreement would be on terms favorable to us.
 
LPCN 1111: is a next-generation, novel ester prodrug of testosterone comprised of testosterone tridecanoate (“TT”) which uses our proprietary delivery technology to enhance solubility and improve systemic absorption. We completed a Phase 2b dose finding study in hypogonadal men in the third quarter of 2016. The primary objectives of the Phase 2b clinical study were to determine the starting Phase 3 dose of LPCN 1111 along with safety and tolerability of LPCN 1111 and its metabolites following oral administration of single and multiple doses in hypogonadal men. Good dose-response relationship was observed over the tested dose range in the Phase 2b study. Additionally, the target Phase 3 dose met primary and secondary end points. Overall, LPCN 1111 was well tolerated with no drug-related severe or serious adverse events reported in the Phase 2b study.

In February 2018 we had a meeting with the FDA to discuss these pre-clinical results and to discuss the Phase 3 clinical study and path forward for LPCN 1111. Based on the results of the FDA meeting and additional pre-clinical studies conducted after the FDA meeting, we have proposed a Phase 3 protocol for LPCN 1111 and have solicited FDA feedback. Based on initial FDA feedback, we expect the Phase 3 clinical trial design to follow the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH”) guidelines and we expect the trial will include at least a 3-month efficacy treatment period and a 1-year safety component for approximately 100 subjects. We are currently seeking further clarification from FDA with respect to the total subject LPCN 1111 exposure information needed for an NDA filing. We continue to refine the Phase 3 protocol and plan to request FDA approval of the protocol once it is finalized. Additionally, the FDA previously requested that a food effect and a phlebotomy study be completed, and that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (“ABPM”) be included as part of the Phase 3 clinical study. We are currently transferring the manufacturing of LPCN 1111 to a third-party contract manufacturer and scaling up the formulation after which we anticipate the next steps for a partner developing LPCN 1111 may be to conduct a food effect/phlebotomy study with LPCN 1111. Under the terms of the Antares License Agreement, Antares had been granted an option to license LPCN 1111, exercisable on or before March 31, 2022, for further development and, should LPCN 1111 receive FDA approval, commercialization. On April 1, 2022, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the License Agreement (the “Amendment”), pursuant to which the License Agreement was amended to extend the deadline by which Antares was to exercise its option to license LPCN 1111 to June 30, 2022. As consideration for the Company’s agreement to the Amendment, Antares paid the Company a non-refundable cash fee of $500,000 in April 2022. On June 30, 2022, Antares’ option to license LPCN 1111 expired and was not exercised.
 
LPCN 1107: An Oral Product Candidate for the Prevention of Preterm Birth
 
We are exploring the possibility of partnering LPCN 1107 to a third party, although no partnering agreement has been entered into by the Company. No assurance can be given that any partnership agreement will be completed, or, if an agreement is completed, that such an agreement would be on terms favorable to us.
 
We believe LPCN 1107 has the potential to become the first oral hydroxyprogesterone caproate (“HPC”) product indicated for the reduction of risk of PTB (delivery less than 37 weeks) in women with singleton pregnancy who have a history of singleton spontaneous PTB. Prevention of PTB is a significant unmet need as approximately 11% of all U.S. pregnancies result in PTB, a leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity.
 
Current Status
 
We have completed a multi-dose PK dose selection study in pregnant women. The objective of the multi-dose PK selection study was to assess HPC blood levels in order to identify the appropriate LPCN 1107 Phase 3 dose. The multi-dose PK dose selection study was an open-label, 4-period, 4-treatment, randomized, single and multiple dose PK study in pregnant women with 3 dose levels of LPCN 1107 and the IM HPC (Makena®). The study enrolled 12 healthy pregnant women (average age of 27 years) with a gestational age of approximately 16 to 19 weeks. Subjects received three dose levels of LPCN 1107 (400 mg BID, 600 mg BID, or 800 mg BID) in a randomized, crossover manner during the first 3 treatment periods and then received 5 weekly injections of HPC during the fourth treatment period. During each of the LPCN 1107 treatment periods, subjects received a single dose of LPCN 1107 on Day 1 followed by twice daily administration from Day 2 to Day 8. Following completion of the 3 LPCN 1107 treatment periods and a washout period, all subjects received 5 weekly injections of HPC. Results from this study demonstrated that average steady state HPC levels (Cavg0-24) were comparable or higher for all 3 LPCN 1107 doses than for injectable HPC. Additionally, HPC levels as a function of daily dose were linear for the 3 LPCN 1107 doses. Also, unlike the injectable HPC, steady state exposure was achieved for all 3 LPCN 1107 doses within 7 days.
 
A traditional PK/PD based Phase 2 clinical study in the intended patient population is not expected to be required prior to entering into Phase 3. Therefore, based on the results of our multi-dose PK study we had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting and subsequent guidance meetings with the FDA to define a pivotal Phase 2b/3 development plan for LPCN 1107. However, these discussions may be updated based on recent developments with Covis’ Makena® as described below. We have completed a food effect study to characterize the dosing regimen for the pivotal study. We plan to submit a pivotal clinical study protocol to the FDA.

The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to LPCN 1107 based on a major contribution to patient care. Orphan designation qualifies Lipocine for various development incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, and a waiver of the prescription drug user fee when we file our NDA.
 
Recent Competition Update
 
On October 5, 2020, the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”) proposed that Makena be withdrawn from the market because the PROLONG trial failed to verify the clinical benefit of Makena and concluded that the available evidence does not show Makena is effective for its approved use.
 
CDER issued AMAG Pharmaceuticals, the NDA holder at the time, a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing (“NOOH”) to withdraw approval of Makena, for which AMAG Pharmaceuticals responded by requesting a hearing and providing detail on the company’s position, recognizing clinicians’ decade-long use of treatment with Makena and the public health implications of withdrawing approval. The FDA Commissioner held a public hearing with Covis October 17 through 19, 2022, which resulted in a 14-1 vote recommending removal of the product from the market. A decision whether to withdraw approval of Makena is likely in the first half of 2023 . During this time, Makena and the approved generics of Makena have remained on the market pending a final decision about these products by the FDA.
 
Currently, Makena and the approved generics of Makena are the only products approved for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth.
 
Research and Development
 
As disclosed in our development pipeline, we continue to build a diversified multi-asset pipeline of novel therapies. In 2022 and 2021, we spent $8.6 million and $7.7 million, respectively, on research and development.
Competition 
 
Neuroactive Steroids Market overview
 
The unique potential mechanism of action (“MOA”) of NAS presents an opportunity to treat variety of CNS disorders. Accordingly, multiple NAS as GABAA receptor PAMs are in active development for varied indications. Some companies engaged in development include SAGE Therapeutics, Inc., Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Praxis Precision Medicines, and Eliem Therapeutics.
Postpartum Depression
 
Sage Therapeutics is currently marketing an injectable version of an endogenous neuroactive steroid, brexanolone, under the tradename of ZULRESSO™, as the first and only FDA approved product (approval on 03/19/2019) for treatment in postpartum depression (“PPD”).
 
SAGE therapeutics is also currently developing an oral synthetic derivative of an endogenous NAS, SAGE-217 (Zuranolone), a GABAA receptor PAM, and SAGE submitted an NDA with a PDUFA action date in August 2023. Zuranolone (oral) received Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (“MDD”) in February 2018.
 
Marinus Pharmaceuticals has also reported clinical development of Ganaxolone, a synthetic GABAA receptor PAM in PPD that has been studied in two Phase 2 trials, one investigating IV +/- oral administration (Magnolia part 1 and 2) and one oral administration (Amaryllis). Additional assets of the same MOA are indicated for MDD (PRAX-114 and ETX-155) but could be pivoted to a PPD indication.
 
Cirrhosis Market Overview 
 
Decompensated cirrhosis patients with sarcopenia exhibit significantly shorter overall survival than those without sarcopenia. There are no therapies specifically approved for sarcopenia or decompensated cirrhosis. Currently, the only curative therapy for decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplant; however, liver transplantation is very costly, limited by the supply of available donors, and has a high risk of post-operative complications.

14
--


Xifaxan® (rifaximin) is the only FDA-approved medicine indicated for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) recurrence in adults, a decompensation event typically associated with liver cirrhosis.
 
Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs to treat secondary sarcopenia in decompensated cirrhosis beyond treatment of the underlying conditions. Lipocine is a leader in pursuing treatment for subjects with decompensated cirrhosis with sarcopenia, however there are candidates known to be under development for cirrhosis related indication(s).
 
GB 1211 (by Galecto), an oral galectin-3 inhibitor for advanced liver cirrhosis targeted for directly addressing fibrosis, is in Phase 2 development being assessed in patients with moderate-to-severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh classes B and C) and is anticipated to read out in the second half of 2022.
 
Reformulated Rifaximin SSD (by BAUSCH health) is in a Phase 3 study for Reduction of Early Decompensation in Cirrhosis with time to first occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy as the primary endpoint. Reportedly, a new drug application (“NDA”) is planned to be submitted 2026.
 
Testosterone Replacement Therapy Market Overview
 
The gel-based testosterone replacement products that are currently available include AbbVie’s AndroGel®, Lilly’s Axiron® Topical Solution and Endo’s Testim® and Fortesta® along with their respective authorized generics as well as the equivalent generic versions of each. Transdermal patches include Allergan’s Androderm®. Intramuscular forms of testosterone also exist although commercialized mostly in generic forms by multiple companies and in branded form as Aveed® by Endo. Additionally, Endo markets the buccal testosterone replacement therapy Striant® and the Testopel® implantable testosterone pellets, which it acquired from Auxillium in 2015. Antares Pharma, Inc. markets a sub-cutaneous weekly auto-injector testosterone therapy, Xyosted®. Acerus Pharmaceuticals markets an intranasal testosterone therapy, NATESTO®. Finally, Clarus markets an oral TRT, JATENZO®, which received approval in March 2019.
 
Currently, intramuscular injections have the highest market share in the testosterone replacement market in terms of annual prescriptions. While gels are also a widely used form of TRT, there is a risk of transference; additionally, the gels are messy to apply and have significant compliance issues leading to high rates of discontinuance among patients. Additionally, certain intramuscular injections have the potential to cause pulmonary embolisms as well as cause injection site reactions, scarring, pain and risk of infection in patients. We believe a safe and effective oral therapy could potentially increase patient convenience and compliance, while eliminating the testosterone transference risk associated with gels and injection site reaction of injectables.
 
The FDA has granted a therapeutic equivalence rating of AB to “generic” versions of approved products which have been approved via a 505(b)(2) NDA. In July 2014, FDA granted the AB rating to Perrigo’s 1% testosterone gel drug product (NDA 203098) approved in January 2013, and a BX rating to Teva’s 1% gel drug product (NDA 202763) approved in February 2012. Each are versions of AbbVie’s AndroGel 1.0% and employed 505(b)(2) submissions citing AndroGel as their reference listed drugs. Teva’s version was found to be bioinequivalent to AndroGel, hence the BX rating. Upsher-Smith Laboratories also received approval for a version of Endo’s Testim (Vogelxo™; NDA 204399) in June 2014 using the same pathway. In January of 2015, the FDA determined that Vogelxo™ is therapeutically equivalent to Testim and received an AB rating. In August 2015, the FDA granted AB rating to Perrigo’s 1.62% testosterone gel drug product (NDA 204268) which also received FDA approval in August 2015. Lilly and Acrux’s Axiron had patent expiry in February 2017. On July 6, 2017, Acrux confirmed that a generic version of Axiron® Topical Solution, 30 mg/1.5 mL (Testosterone Topical Solution, 30 mg/1.5 mL) has been launched in the United States by Perrigo Company plc. Acrux also confirmed the availability of an authorized generic version of Axiron in the United States, through a marketing and distribution agreement between Lilly and Company and a leading authorized generics company
 
Other TRT Therapies in Development 
 
Recently there has been increased interest in developing oral TRT’s as well as testosterone therapies which are not considered testosterone replacement and as such will need to achieve efficacy endpoints in addition to endpoints related to serum testosterone levels that are required for testosterone replacement therapies.
 
Marius is developing an oral TU as a testosterone replacement therapy for the treatment of hypogonadism in men as well as in the treatment of Constitutional Delay of Growth and Puberty in adolescent boys (14-17 years of age). Marinus submitted a NDA to the FDA in January 2021 for its product, Kyzatrex™, its novel oral TU soft gelatin capsule for the treatment of hypogonadism in adult men and received FDA approval on August 2, 2022 for KYZATREX®.

We believe there remains a significant unmet need in TRT for a once-a-day convenient oral option. LPCN 1111 is targeted to meet this unmet need.
 
NASH Market Overview 
 
There are currently no medications approved for the treatment of NASH. However, various therapeutics are used off-label for the treatment of NASH, including vitamin E (an antioxidant), insulin sensitizers (e.g., metformin, pioglitazone), antihyperlipidemic agents (e.g., gemfibrozil), pentoxifylline and ursodeoxycholic acid. There are several product candidates in Phase 3 or earlier clinical or preclinical development for the treatment of NASH, including FGF21 stimulants such as BIO89-100 (89bio), Efruxifermin (EFX; Akero Therapeutics), Pegbelfermin (Bristol Myers Squibb/Ambrx Inc.); FGF19 Analog:Aldafermin (NGM Biopharmaceuticals); FXR Agonists: Tropifexor (Novartis), EDP-305 (Enata Pharmaceuticals), PXL007/EYP001 (Poxel/Enyo Pharma:) Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Agonist: Semaglutide (Novo Nordisk); Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor (PPAR) Regulator: Lanifibranor (Inventiva);THR-β Agonis:t VK2809 (Viking Therapeutics), and Resmetirom (Madrigal Pharmaceuticals).
 
Additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with product candidates in development for the treatment of NASH include AstraZeneca plc, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc., CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc., Durect Corporation, Galectin Therapeutics Inc., Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Immuron Ltd., Intercept Pharmaceutcials, Inc., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Islet Sciences, Inc., Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MediciNova, Inc., MiNA Therapeutics, NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S, NuSirt Sciences Inc., Viking Therapeutics, Inc. and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. In December 2022, Madrigal announced achievement of liver histological improvement endoints that the FDA proposed as reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit from the pivotal Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH clinical trial of resmetirom for the treatment of NASH and liver fibrosis. Madrigal stated that they intend to file a new drug application seeking accelerated approval of resmetirom for the treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH with liver fibrosis.
 
Hydroxyprogesterone caproate, or HPC, Preterm Birth, or PTB, Market Overview 
 
PTB is defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. The only approved therapy  for prevention of PTB in women with a prior history of at least one preterm birth (approximately 145,000 pregnancies annually) is a weekly intramuscular injection of HPC, marketed by Covis under the brand name Makena®. The FDA granted a 7-year orphan drug exclusivity to Makena in February 2011 because the product is intended to treat “rare diseases or conditions” defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States; exclusivity expired in February 2018. Generic versions of the intramuscular injection of Makena became available during 2018. In order to protect market share, Covis also developed a subcutaneous auto-injector for Makena that received FDA approval on February 14, 2018. Treatment with Makena is initiated in pregnant women between week 16 and week 20 of pregnancy and is continued until up to delivery or week 37, whichever is earlier. The intramuscular injection is administered by a healthcare provider using a 21-gauge needle into the gluteus muscle, alternating sides each week. The intramuscular injections are associated with significant pain, discomfort and associated injection site reactions. The subcutaneous auto-injector for Makena eliminates the need to travel weekly to a healthcare provider to have the injection administered. Covis disclosed that the completed confirmatory trial for Makena did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the treatment and placebo arms for the co-primary endpoints of reducing the risk of recurrent preterm birth or improving neonatal mortality and morbidity. On October 29, 2019 a Meeting of the Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“BRUDAC”) was held to consider the trial’s findings and the sNDA in the context of AMAG Pharmaceuticals’ confirmatory study obligation. While the committee discussed multiple questions, in a mixed vote on the key question, nine advisory committee members voted to recommend that the FDA pursue withdrawal of approval for Makena and seven committee members voted to leave the product on the market under accelerated approval and require a new confirmatory trial. Among the clinicians on the advisory committee, five of the six who practice obstetrics voted to keep Makena on the market and generate more data. On October 5, 2020, the FDA’s CDER proposed that Makena be withdrawn from the market because the PROLONG trial failed to verify the clinical benefit of Makena and concluded that the available evidence does not show Makena is effective for its approved use.
 
CDER issued AMAG, the NDA holder at the time, a NOOH to withdraw approval of Makena, for which AMAG Pharmaceuticals responded by requesting a hearing and providing detail on the company’s position, recognizing clinicians’ decade-long use of Makena’s treatment and the public health implications of withdrawing approval. The FDA Commissioner granted a hearing, and the hearing was held October 17 through 19, 2022, which resulted in a 14-1 vote recommending withdrawal of the product from the market. A decision whether to withdraw approval of Makena is likely in the first half of 2023. During this time, Makena and the approved generics of Makena will remain on the market until the FDA makes a final decision about these products.

Intellectual Property 
 
Drug Delivery Technologies for Lipophilic Drug Substances 
 
Our patent portfolio is directed to various types of compositions and methods for delivery of lipophilic drugs, which are drugs that are soluble in lipids. Our licensed product, TLANDO, is an oral formulation of the lipophilic prodrug TU, utilizing our proprietary technology for improved delivery of lipophilic therapeutic agents.
 
As of March 7, 2023, our intellectual property patent portfolio consists of various issued patents and patent applications related to Oral TU, LPCN 1111, LPCN 1107, LPCN 1144/1148, and Neurosteroids/CNS treatment both in the U.S. and in multiple countries outside of the U.S.


We also hold license rights in fields other than cough and cold, to 2 U.S. patents and 1 U.S. application (and related foreign patents and applications) that we previously assigned to Spriaso LLC, which could be possibly used with future product candidates.
 
Additionally, we have 12 U.S. patents that we plan to list in the FDA Orange Book for TLANDO that are expected to expire in 2029 and 2030. If we or our licensee are marketing the TLANDO product at the time the patents expire and have no other issued U.S. patents covering the product, then we will lose certain advantages that come with FDA Orange Book listing of patents and will no longer be able to prevent others in the U.S. from practicing the inventions claimed by the 12 patents.

We expect to file new patent applications in the future in an attempt to further cover various aspects of our products and product development.
 
See Item 3 – Legal Proceedings, for a discussion of intellectual property related legal proceedings.
 
Government Regulation 
 
The Regulatory Process for Drug Development 
 
The production and manufacture of our product candidates and our research and development activities are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities around the world. In the United States, drugs and products are subject to regulation by the FDA. There are other comparable agencies in Europe and other parts of the world. Regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products. Applicable law requires licensing and registration of manufacturing and contract research facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, governmental review and/or approval of results prior to marketing therapeutic products. Additionally, adherence to good laboratory practices, or GLP, good clinical practices, or GCP, during clinical testing and current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, during production is required. The system of new drug approval in the United States is generally considered to be the most rigorous in the world and is described in further detail below under “United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process.”
United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process 
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the regulations it implements. The testing, production, sale, and promotion of pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
It takes many years for a typical experimental drug to go from concept to approval. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:
 

● | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies. The latter often conducted according to GLPs or other applicable regulations, as well as synthesis and drug formulation development leading ultimately to clinical drug supplies manufactured according to cGMPs; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must be submitted to the FDA and become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 
● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s current GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use; 
● | Submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new pharmaceutical product; 
● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
● | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

 
The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and FDA approval is inherently uncertain.
 
Preclinical Studies: Prior to preclinical studies, a research phase takes place which involves demonstration of target and function, design, screening and synthesis of agonists or antagonists. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to evaluate efficacy and activity, toxic effects, PKs and metabolism of the pharmaceutical product candidate and to provide evidence of the safety, bioavailability and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate in animals. The conduct of the preclinical safety evaluations must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The results of the formal IND-enabling preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature as well as the comprehensive descriptions of proposed human clinical studies, are then submitted as part of the IND application to the FDA.
 

18
--


The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the IND on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical trial.
 
Clinical Trials: Clinical trials involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA if conducted under a U.S. IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics committee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
Phase 1 Clinical Trials: Phase 1 clinical trials are usually first-in-man trials, take approximately 1 to 2 years to complete and are generally conducted on a small number of healthy human subjects to evaluate the drug’s activity, schedule and dose, PKs and pharmacodynamics. However, in the case of life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, the initial Phase 1 testing may be done in patients with the disease. These trials typically take longer to complete and may provide insights into drug activity.
 
Phase 2 Clinical Trials: Phase 2 clinical trials can take approximately 1 to 3 years to complete and are carried out on a relatively small to moderate number of patients (as compared to Phase 3) in a specific indication. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated to preliminarily assess efficacy, to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and to determine optimal dose, regimens, PKs, pharmacodynamics and dose response relationships. This phase also provides additional safety data and serves to identify possible common short-term side effects and risks in a larger group of patients. Phase 2 clinical trials sometimes include randomization of patients.
 
Phase 3 Clinical Trials: Phase 3 clinical trials take approximately 2 to 5 years to complete and involve tests on a much larger population of patients (several hundred to several thousand patients) suffering from the targeted condition or disease. These studies usually include randomization of patients and blinding of both patients and investigators at geographically dispersed test sites (multi-center trials). These trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety and are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, 2 adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or foreign authorities for approval of NDAs.
 
Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or for any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, its data safety and monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s or ethics committee’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. Pharmaceutical Review and Approval Process 
 
New Drug Application: Upon completion of pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies, the sponsor assembles all the product development, preclinical and clinical data along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, and submits it to the FDA as part of an NDA. The submission or application is then reviewed by the regulatory body for approval to market the product. This process typically takes 8 months to 1 year to complete. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
Orphan Drug Designation 
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. If the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the FDA then discloses publicly the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for 7 years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 
Any pharmaceutical products for which we may receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with the FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with the FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 
21st Century Cures Act
 
The 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law No. 144-255) was enacted on December 13, 2016. This sweeping legislation makes significant changes to the way that FDA approves new drugs and medical devices. Among other things, the legislation calls on FDA to consider new types of data, such as patient experience data, in its drug approval process. The legislation also permits drug manufacturers to utilize new types of clinical trial designs in order to collect data in the drug approval process. The intent of many of the statute’s provisions are to speed the approval of new drugs and medical devices. Whether the 21st Century Cures Act realizes these goals will depend on the adoption of new FDA regulations, policy guidance and FDA approval practices, many of which the agency has not yet proposed or issued.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including, but not limited, to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other divisions of the United States government, including the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state healthcare programs, our Company, including our sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, among others, must comply with federal healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, false claims laws, civil monetary penalties laws, healthcare fraud and false statement provisions and data privacy and security provisions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and any analogous state laws. If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (“OBRA”), and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Among other things, OBRA requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs and empowers states to negotiate rebates on pharmaceutical prices, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, “ACA”) substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, ACA establishes: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. There may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, in the future, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of drug products. If drug products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements may apply.
 
Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including fraud and abuse, privacy and transparency laws.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payers often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Third-party payers are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In particular, in the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of insurers and managed care organizations, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. As a result, coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
 
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Pub. L. No. 117-169) was signed into law on August 16, 2022, and includes a number of provisions aimed at lowering prescription drug costs and reducing government spending on drugs. This includes a requirement that the Department of Health and Human Services negotiate a “maximum fair price” with drug manufacturers for certain single-source brand drugs or biologics without generic or biosimilar competitors that are covered under Medicare Part D and Part B. This pricing will begin in 2026 for Medicare Part D and 2028 for Medicare Part B. An excise tax is imposed on drug manufacturers that fail to comply with the required negotiation process. In addition, the law requires drug manufacturers to pay a rebate to the federal government if the price for almost all drugs covered under Medicare Part D (starting in 2022), and single-source drug or biologics covered under Medicare B (starting in 2023), increase greater than the inflation rate. The rebate amount equals the number of drug units sold in Medicare multiplied by the amount the drug’s price exceeds the inflation-adjusted price. The law also modifies the Medicare Part D benefit structure to cap the amount beneficiaries must spend on drug costs and increase the discounts manufacturers are required to pay. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 signals an increased desire to control the prices and costs associated with pharmaceutical products. This legislation, as well as any future statutes or regulations at the federal or state level, may impact reimbursement for our product candidates and may challenge our ability to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
 
The market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payers’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payers provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or may otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less-costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payer separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. If we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them, and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
 
The United States Orphan Drug Act encourages the development of orphan drugs, which are intended to treat “rare diseases or conditions” within the meaning of this Act (i.e., those that affect fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States). The provisions of the Act are intended to stimulate the research, development and approval of products that treat rare diseases. Orphan Drug Designation provides a sponsor with several potential benefits: (1) sponsors may be granted seven years of marketing exclusivity after approval of the orphan-designated indication for the drug product; (2) sponsors are granted U.S. tax incentives for clinical research; (3) the FDA’s office of orphan products development coordinates research study design assistance for sponsors of drugs for rare diseases; and (4) grant funding can be obtained to defray costs of qualified clinical testing.

Priority Review 
 
Priority Review is a designation for an NDA after it has been submitted to the FDA for review. Reviews for NDAs are designated as either “Standard” or “Priority.” A Standard designation sets the target date for completing all aspects of a review and the FDA taking an action on 90% of applications (i.e., approve or not approve) at 12 months after the date it was submitted for drugs considered new molecular entities and at 10 months after the date it was submitted for drugs considered non-new molecular entities. A Priority designation sets the target date for the FDA action on 90% of applications at eight months after submission for drugs considered new molecular entities and at 6 months after submission for drugs considered non-new molecular entities. A Priority designation is intended for those products that address unmet medical needs.
Accelerated Approval 
 
Accelerated Approval or Subpart H Approval is a program described in the NDA regulations that is intended to make promising products for life threatening diseases available on the basis of evidence of effect on a surrogate endpoint prior to formal demonstration of patient benefit. A surrogate marker is a measurement intended to substitute for the clinical measurement of interest, usually prolongation of survival in oncology that is considered likely to predict patient benefit. The approval that is granted may be considered a provisional approval with a written commitment to complete clinical studies that formally demonstrate patient benefit.
Related Party Transaction
 
On July 23, 2013, we entered into assignment/license and services agreements with Spriaso, an entity that is majority-owned by Mahesh V. Patel, Gordhan Patel, John W. Higuchi, Dr. William I. Higuchi, and their affiliates. Mahesh V. Patel is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Higuchi is a member of our Board of Directors and Gordhan Patel and Dr. Higuchi, former Board members, were each members of our Board of Directors at the date the license and agreements were entered into.
 
Under the assignment agreement, we assigned and transferred to Spriaso all of our rights, title and interest in our intellectual property for the cough and cold field. In addition, Spriaso was assigned all rights and obligations under our product development agreement with a co-development partner. In exchange, we would be entitled to receive a potential cash royalty of 20% of the net proceeds received by Spriaso, up to a maximum of $10 million. Spriaso also granted back to us an exclusive license to such intellectual property to develop products outside of the cough and cold field. The assignment agreement will expire upon the expiration of all of Spriaso’s payment obligations thereunder and the expiration of all of the licensed patents thereunder. Spriaso has the right to terminate the assignment agreement with 30 days written notice. We have the right to terminate the assignment agreement upon the complete liquidation or dissolution of Spriaso, unless the assignment agreement is assigned to an affiliate or successor of Spriaso.
 
Under the services agreement, we agreed to provide facilities and up to 10% of the services of certain employees to Spriaso for a period of time. The agreement to provide services expired in 2021; however, it may be extended upon written agreement of Spriaso and us. Additionally, Spriaso filed its first NDA in 2014, and as an affiliated entity of Lipocine, it used up the one-time waiver of user fees for a small business submitting its first human drug application to FDA.
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 17 full time employees and we also utilize the services of consultants on a regular basis. Twelve employees are engaged in drug development activities and five are in general and administration functions and the majority of our employees work out of our Salt Lake City facility. The Company continually evaluates the business need and opportunity and balances in house expertise and capacity with outsourced expertise and capacity. Currently, we outsource substantial clinical trial work to clinical research organizations and certain drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
We strive toward having a diverse team of employees and are committed to equality, inclusion and workplace diversity.
