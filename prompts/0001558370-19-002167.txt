 Our Company
 We were founded in 1995 and are an established nationwide independent residential mortgage lender which originates, sells and services residential mortgage loans. We originate non-qualified mortgages (NonQM), conventional mortgage loans eligible for sale to U.S. government‑sponsored enterprises, (GSEs), including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac (conventional loans), and government‑insured mortgage loans eligible for government securities issued through Ginnie Mae (government loans). 
 During the first quarter of 2018, our previous Chairman and CEO Joseph Tomkinson, announced that he would be retiring as of July 31, 2018. As part of this announcement, the Board of Directors appointed George Mangiaracina as President and subsequently Chairman and CEO upon Mr. Tomkinson’s retirement.  As part of this transition, we announced additional changes to our senior management team and Board of Directors in 2018.  
 Segments
 Our business activities are organized and presented in three primary operating segments: Mortgage Lending, Real Estate Services and the Long‑Term Mortgage Portfolio. Our mortgage lending segment provides mortgage lending products through three lending channels, retail, wholesale and correspondent and opportunistically retain mortgage servicing rights.  Our real estate services segment performs master servicing and provides loss mitigation services for primarily our securitized long-term mortgage portfolio.  And, our long-term mortgage portfolio consists of residual interests in securitization trusts.  A description of each operating segment is presented below with further details and discussions of each segment’s results of operations presented in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations.”
 In addition to the segments described above, we also have a corporate segment, which supports all of the operating segments. The corporate segment includes unallocated corporate and other administrative costs as described below.
 Mortgage Lending
 We are focused on expanding our mortgage lending platform which provides conventional and government‑insured mortgage loans as well as providing innovative products to meet the needs of borrowers not met by traditional conventional and government products. Our mortgage lending operation generates origination and processing fees, net of origination costs, at the time of origination as well as gains or unexpected losses when the loans are sold to third party investors, including the GSEs and Ginnie Mae. We retain mortgage servicing rights from the sale of mortgage loans and earn servicing fees, net of sub‑servicer costs, from our mortgage servicing portfolio. From time to time, we sell mortgage servicing rights from our servicing portfolio.
 During 2014, we rolled out and began originating NonQM loans. NonQM mortgages are generally loans that do not meet the qualified mortgage (QM) guidelines set out by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  We believe there is an underserved mortgage market for borrowers with good credit who may not meet the NonQM guidelines, for example self-employed borrowers. As the demand by consumers for the NonQM product grows we expect the investor appetite will increase for the NonQM mortgages. A NonQM borrower is generally less sensitive to interest rates and generally does not have the same income documentation that a conforming loan borrower does, nonetheless the borrower is still required to meet the “ability to repay” guidelines.
 As a nationwide mortgage lender, we are approved to originate and service Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae eligible loans. We primarily originate, sell and service conventional, conforming agency and government insured residential mortgage loans originated or acquired through our three channels: Retail (consumer direct), Correspondent and Wholesale. 

· | Retail (consumer direct) channel - CashCall Mortgage (CCM), operates as a centralized call center that utilizes a marketing platform to generate customer leads through the internet and call center loan agents. As a centralized retail call center, loan applications are received and taken by loan agents directly from consumers and through the internet.

 Our mortgage lending activities primarily consist of the origination, sale and servicing of conventional loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government‑insured loans eligible for Ginnie Mae securities issuance as well as NonQM. We currently originate and fund mortgages through our wholly‑owned subsidiary, IMC. In order to originate mortgage loans we must be able to finance them and hold them on our balance sheet until such loans are sold. In order to do this we must have lines of credit with banks (called warehouse lines) that allow us the short term funding required.
 The following table presents selected data from our mortgage lending operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:

(in millions) | 2018 | | 2017 | 
Originations | $ | 3,839.6 | | $ | 7,111.7 
Servicing Portfolio | | 6,218.1 | | | 16,330.1
Mortgage servicing rights | | 64.7 | | | 154.4 
Servicing fees, net | | 37.3 | | | 31.9 

      Our origination volumes decreased 46% in 2018 to $3.8 billion as compared to $7.1 billion in 2017. Of the $3.8 billion in total originations in 2018, approximately $1.8 billion, or 48%, was originated through the retail channel. In contrast, during 2017, our retail originations contributed 65% to our total origination volume. From January 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2018, interest rates have increased significantly from the historically low interest rate environment the previous years, causing a sharp drop in refinance volume which has been the predominance of our retail originations.
     Our loan products primarily include NonQM mortgages, conventional loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and loans eligible for government insurance (government loans) by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Veterans Affairs (VA), and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
     Our mortgage servicing portfolio decreased in 2018 primarily due to a shift in strategy during the third and fourth quarters of 2018 to direct our efforts on repositioning the Company by focusing on our core NonQM lending business and strengthen our liquidity position. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed two servicing sales of approximately $10.5 billion in unpaid principal balance (UPB) of FNMA and GNMA mortgage servicing rights (MSR). 
 Each of our three origination channels, Retail, Wholesale and Correspondent, produces similar mortgage loan products and applies similar underwriting standards.

 | For the year ended December 31,
(in millions) | 2018 | | % | | | 2017 | | % 
Originations by Channel: | | | | | | | | | | 
Retail | $ | 1,842.2 | | 48 | % | | $ | 4,611.5 | 65 | %
Correspondent | | 1,119.5 | | 29 | | | | 1,420.4 | 20 | 
Wholesale | | 877.9 | | 23 | | | | 1,079.8 | 15 | 
Total originations | $ | 3,839.6 | | 100 | % | | $ | 7,111.7 | 100 | %

  Retail—Our retail channel today consists of our consumer direct call center CCM, a leading originator which was previously based in Orange, California.  During the fourth quarter of 2018 we relocated the consumer direct call center from the office in Orange into our corporate office in Irvine, California.  This transition was part of our plan to streamline the operations and reposition the consumer direct platform to be more competitive in a challenging lending market.
 The retail channel  utilizes a high‑volume, rapid response time funding model with a focus on providing exceptional customer service. The acquisition of CCM’s residential lending platform in 2015 added a centralized retail call center to IMC’s current business‑to‑business origination channels and provides additional capacity to process increased origination volumes of expanded products including our NonQM loan programs and government insured Ginnie Mae programs, while profitably creating servicing assets for IMC.
 When loans are originated on a retail basis, the origination documentation is completed inclusive of customer disclosures and other aspects of the lending process and funding of the transaction is completed internally. Our call center representatives contact borrowers through either inbound or outbound marketing campaigns sourced from our digital marketing campaigns, TV and radio ads, purchase‑money and refinance mortgage leads, including leads sourced from

customer referrals and retention of customers in the servicing portfolio that are seeking to refinance or purchase a property. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed $1.8 billion of loans in this origination channel, which equaled 48% of total originations, as compared to $4.6 billion or 65% of total originations during 2017.
 Correspondent—Our correspondent channel represents mortgage loans acquired from our correspondent sellers. Our correspondent channel has historically targeted a market of small banks, credit unions and small mortgage banking firms. Prior to accepting loans from correspondent sellers, each seller is underwritten to determine if it meets financial and other guidelines. Our review of each prospective seller includes obtaining a third party due diligence report that verifies licensing, insurance coverage, quality of recent Federal Housing Administration (FHA) originations and provides information on any industry sanctions that might exist. In addition, each seller is required to sign our correspondent seller agreement that contains certain representations and warranties from the seller allowing us to require the seller to repurchase a loan sold to us for various reasons including (i) ineligibility for sale to GSEs, (ii) early payment default, (iii) early pay‑off or (iv) if the loan is uninsurable by a government agency.
 In our correspondent channel, the correspondent seller originates and closes the loan. After the loan is originated, the correspondent seller provides the needed documentation and information to us to review and determine if it meets our underwriting guidelines. The loan is acquired by us only after we approve it for purchase. We focus on customer service for our clients by facilitating prompt review by our due diligence team, providing bid pricing on both newly originated and seasoned portfolios, enabling clients to deliver one loan at a time on a flow basis and providing clients with expedited funding timelines. We purchase NonQM loans, conventional loans eligible for sale to the GSEs and government‑insured loans eligible for Ginnie Mae securities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed loans totaling $1.1 billion in the correspondent origination channel, which equaled 29% of total originations, compared to $1.4, billion or 20%, of total originations during 2017. 
 Wholesale—In a wholesale transaction, our account executives work directly with mortgage brokers who originate and document loans for delivery to our operational center where we underwrite and fund the mortgage loan. Each loan is underwritten to our underwriting standards and, if approved, the borrower is sent new disclosures under our name and the loan is funded in the name of Impac Mortgage.
 Prior to accepting loans from mortgage brokers, each mortgage broker is required to meet our guidelines for minimum experience, credit score and net worth. We also obtain a third‑party due diligence report for each prospective broker that verifies licensing and provides information on any industry sanctions that might exist. In addition, each mortgage broker is required to sign our broker agreement that contains certain representations and warranties from the brokers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed loans totaling $877.9 million in this origination channel, which equaled 23% of total originations, as compared to $1.1 billion, or 15%, of total originations during 2017.
 Since 2011, we have provided loans to customers predominantly in the Western U.S. with California, Washington and Arizona comprising 67.7% of originations in 2018. Currently, we provide nationwide lending with our retail call center, correspondent sellers and mortgage brokers.
 Loan Types
 Our loan products primarily include conventional loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and loans eligible for government insurance by FHA, Veteran’s Administration (VA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and NonQM. The FHA, VA and USDA loans are government-insured loans eligible for Ginnie Mae securities issuance. We have established strict lending guidelines, including determining the prospective borrowers’ ability to repay the mortgage, which we believe will keep delinquencies and foreclosures at acceptable levels. We continue to refine our guidelines to expand our reach to the underserved market of credit worthy borrowers who can fully document and substantiate an ability to repay mortgage loans, but unable to obtain financing through traditional programs (QM loans), for example self-employed borrowers.  In conjunction with establishing strict lending guidelines, we have also established investor relationships which provide us with an exit strategy for these nonconforming loans. In 2018, one of our strategic relationships closed two private label securitizations with AAA ratings by two ratings agencies, which were both 100% backed by our NonQM collateral.  In 2018, our NonQM origination volume increased to $1.3 billion with an average Fair Isaac Company credit score (FICO) of 725 and a weighted average loan to value ratio (LTV) of 68%. In 2017, our NonQM origination volume was $891.2 million with an average Fair Isaac Company credit score (FICO) of 723 and a weighted average loan to value ratio (LTV) of 64%.

Total originations | $ | 3,839.6 | | $ | 7,111.7

      Loan Sales—Selling Loans to GSEs, Issuing Ginnie Mae Securities and Selling Loans on a Whole Loan Basis
 We sell the mortgage loans to the secondary market, including sales to the GSEs and issuing securities through Ginnie Mae. We opportunistically sell loans on a servicing‑retained basis where the loan is sold to an investor such as Freddie Mac, and we retain the right to service that loan, called mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). We securitize government-insured loans by issuing Ginnie Mae securities through a process whereby a pool of loans is transferred to Ginnie Mae as collateral for a government-insured mortgage‑backed security. Traditionally, we have not sold a significant amount of residential mortgage loans on a whole loan basis where the investor also acquires the servicing rights. In 2018, we began to do more whole loans sales in an effort to expand our take out investor base for NonQM loans and balance our investment in MSRs with our liquidity needs.  
 Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, Fannie Mae sufficiently limited the manner and volume for our deliveries of eligible loans such that we elected to cease deliveries to them and we expanded our whole loan investor base for these loans.  During 2018, we completed servicing released loan sales to these whole loan investors and expect to continue to utilize these alternative exit strategies for Fannie Mae eligible loans.  We continue to take steps to manage our prepayment speeds to be more consistent with our industry comparables and to reestablish the full confidence and delivery mechanisms to our investor base. We remain an approved Seller and Servicer with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 The following table indicates the breakdown of our loan sales to GSEs, issuance of Ginnie Mae securities and loans sold to investors on a whole loan basis for the periods as indicated:

 | For the year ended
 | December 31, 
(in millions) | 2018 | | 2017
Fannie Mae | $ | — | | $ | 2,052.4
Freddie Mac | | 878.2 | | | 2,149.7
Ginnie Mae | | 1,512.0 | | | 1,879.0
Total servicing retained sales | | 2,390.2 | | | 6,081.1
Other (servicing released) | | 1,664.2 | | | 854.9 
Total loan sales | $ | 4,054.4 | | $ | 6,936.0

  Mortgage Servicing
 Upon our sale of loans to GSEs or the issuance of securities through Ginnie Mae, we generally retain the mortgage servicing rights with respect to the mortgage loans. We also sell loans on a servicing‑released basis to secondary market investors where we do not retain the servicing rights. When we retain servicing rights, we are entitled to receive a servicing fee which is collected from interest payments made by the borrower and paid to us on a monthly basis equal to a specified percentage, typically between 0.25% and 0.44% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of the loans. We may also be entitled to receive additional servicing compensation, such as late payment fees and earn additional income through the use of non‑interest bearing escrows. As a mortgage servicer, we are required to advance certain amounts to meet the contractual loan servicing requirements for certain investors. We may advance principal, interest, property taxes and insurance for borrowers that have become delinquent, plus any other costs to preserve the property. Also, we will advance funds to maintain, repair and market foreclosed real estate properties. Such advances are typically repaid when the loan becomes current or repaid from the proceeds generated from the sale of the property subsequent to foreclosure.

 We have hired a nationally recognized residential servicer to sub‑service the servicing portfolio. Although we use a sub‑servicer to provide primary servicing and certain default servicing functions, our servicing surveillance team, which is experienced in loss mitigation and real estate recovery, monitors and surveys the performance of the loans and sub‑servicer. We generally earn a servicing fee on each loan, but we also incur the cost of the sub‑servicer as well as the internal servicing surveillance team. Incurring the cost of both a sub‑servicer and an internal surveillance team reduces the net revenues we earn from the mortgage servicing portfolio; however, we believe it reduces our risk by minimizing delinquencies and repurchase risk.
 During 2018, despite the mortgage servicing portfolio decreasing to $6.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 from $16.3 billion at the end of 2017, it generated net servicing income of $37.3 million and $31.9 million, in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease was the result of two servicing sales of approximately $10.5 billion in UPB of FNMA and GNMA MSRs completed during the fourth quarter of 2018. Servicing fees, net will decrease substantially in 2019 as a result of the aforementioned servicing sales during the fourth quarter of 2018.
     We may sell mortgage servicing rights to fund the expansion of origination volumes, balance the capital invested in mortgage servicing with liquidity which has and will result in a decrease in our mortgage servicing portfolio. We may continue to monetize mortgage servicing rights as needed in the future. Furthermore, the value of mortgage servicing rights are affected by increases and decreases in mortgage interest rates. Therefore, volatility in mortgage rates generally causes volatility in the value of mortgage servicing rights.
 Risk Management
 We are exposed to various business risks which may significantly impact our financials. Our risk management framework and governance structure is intended to provide oversight and ongoing management of the risks inherent in our business activities and create a culture of risk awareness.  Our Compliance and Risk Management oversees governance processes and monitoring of these risks including the establishment of risk strategy and documentation of risk policies and controls.  Compliance and Risk Management work in partnership with the business to provide oversight of enterprise risk management and controls. This includes establishing enterprise-level risk management policies, appropriate governance activities and creating risk transparency through risk reporting. For further discussion on operational and market risks, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Operational and Market Risks.”  Underwriting
 We primarily originate residential first mortgage loans for sale that conform to the respective underwriting guidelines established by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, VA and USDA. Our mortgage loans are underwritten individually on a loan‑by‑loan basis. Each mortgage loan originated from our retail and wholesale channel are underwritten by one of our underwriters or by a third party contract underwriter using our underwriting guidelines. Each mortgage loan originated from our correspondent channel is reviewed internally or by a third party underwriting company to determine if the borrower meets our underwriting guidelines.
 Our criteria for underwriting generally include, but are not limited to, full documentation of borrower’s income, assets, other relevant financial information, the specific agency’s eligible loan‑to‑value ratios (LTV), borrower’s debt‑to‑income ratio and full appraisals when required. Variances from any of these standards are permitted only to the extent allowable under the specific program requirements. Our underwriting procedures for all retail and wholesale loans require the use of a GSE automated underwriting system (AUS). Our underwriting procedures for all correspondent loans that have been originated by a correspondent seller includes a file review verifying that the borrower’s credit and the collateral meet our applicable program guidelines and an appropriate AUS report has been completed. We also confirm the loan is compliant with regulatory guidelines. In addition, we perform quality control procedures on selected pools prior to our acquisition of the loan. 
 Quality Control
 Prior to funding, retail and wholesale loans are reviewed internally by our quality control department to verify the loan conforms to our program guidelines and meets state and federal compliance guidelines. Prior to the acquisition of a correspondent loan, we perform quality control procedures on selected pools. Management reviews the reports prior to the acquisition of any correspondent loan. We also perform post origination quality controls procedures on at least 10% of 

 
  6

 
all mortgage loans funded or acquired. Additionally, we closely monitor the servicing performance of loans retained in our mortgage servicing portfolio to identify any opportunities to improve our underwriting process or procedures and identify any issues with mortgage brokers or correspondent sellers. Findings are summarized monthly and the appropriate changes are implemented.
 Hedging
 We are exposed to interest rate risks relating to our mortgage lending operations. We use derivative instruments to manage some of our interest rate risk; however, we do not attempt to hedge interest rate risk completely. For further discussion on interest rate risk and hedging, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Operation and Market Risks.”  Data Security
 Sensitive borrower information, such as name, address and social security number is included in nearly all mortgage loan files. We seek to keep this information secure for every borrower. To do so, our policy requires all sensitive borrower data to be transmitted to us through our secure website portal which allows all of our customers, correspondent sellers, mortgage brokers and individual borrowers to send data to us securely in an encrypted manner. For a discussion of cybersecurity risk see Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Cybersecurity risks, cyber incidents and technology failures may adversely affect our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.”     Real Estate Services
     In 2008, we established our Real Estate Services segment to provide solutions to the distressed mortgage and real estate markets.  We provide loss mitigation and real estate services primarily on our own long‑term mortgage portfolio, including default surveillance, loan modification services, short sale services (where a lender agrees to take less than the balance owed from the borrower), real estate owned (REO) surveillance and disposition services and monitoring, reconciling and reporting services for residential and multifamily mortgage portfolios. The activities and related revenues have declined in recent years, and we expect these revenues to gradually decline over time as our long‑term mortgage portfolio declines.  These operations are conducted by IMC. Long‑Term Mortgage Portfolio
 The long‑term mortgage portfolio primarily consists of residual interests in the securitization trusts reflected as trust assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets that hold non‑conforming mortgage loans originated between 2002 and 2007. Since we are no longer adding new mortgage loans to the long‑term mortgage portfolio, the long‑term mortgage portfolio continues to decrease and is a smaller component of our overall operating results. 
 Our long‑term mortgage portfolio consists of our residual interests in securitizations represented on our consolidated balance sheet as the difference between total trust assets and total trust liabilities. Our long‑term mortgage portfolio includes adjustable rate and, to a lesser extent, fixed rate Alt‑A single‑family residential mortgages and commercial (primarily multifamily residential loans) mortgages that were acquired and originated primarily by our discontinued, non‑conforming mortgage lending operations and retained in our long‑term portfolio before 2008. Alt‑A mortgages are primarily first lien mortgages made to borrowers whose credit was generally within established Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines but have loan characteristics that make them non‑conforming under those guidelines.
 In previous years, we securitized mortgage loans by transferring originated residential single‑family mortgage loans and multifamily commercial loans (the “transferred assets”) into non‑recourse bankruptcy remote trusts which in turn issued tranches of bonds to investors supported only by the cash flows of the transferred assets. Because the assets and liabilities in the securitizations are nonrecourse to us, the bondholders cannot look to us for repayment of their bonds in the event of a shortfall. These securitizations were structured to include interest rate derivatives. We retained the residual interest in each trust, and in most cases are the master servicer. A trustee and servicer, unrelated to us, was named for each securitization. Cash flows from the loans (the loan payments and liquidation of foreclosed real estate properties) collected by the loan servicer are remitted to us, the master servicer. The master servicer remits payments to the trustee who remits payments to the bondholders (investors). The servicer collects loan payments and performs loss mitigation activities for defaulted loans. These activities include foreclosing on properties securing defaulted loans, which results in REO.

 Commercial mortgages in our long‑term mortgage portfolio are primarily adjustable rate mortgages with initial fixed interest rate periods of two, three, five, seven and ten years that subsequently convert to adjustable rate mortgages (hybrid ARMs), and are primarily secured with multi‑family residential real estate. Commercial mortgages have provided greater asset diversification on our consolidated balance sheet as borrowers of commercial mortgages typically have higher credit scores and commercial mortgages typically have lower LTVs.
 Before 2007, we securitized mortgage loans in the form of collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs, which were consolidated and accounted for as secured borrowings for financial statement purposes. Securitized mortgages in the form of real estate mortgage investment conduits, or REMICs, were either consolidated or unconsolidated depending on the design of the securitization structure. We consolidated the variable interest entity, or VIE, as the primary beneficiary of the sole residual interest in each securitization trust where we also performed the master servicing. Amounts consolidated were included in trust assets and liabilities as securitized mortgage collateral, real estate owned, derivative assets, securitized mortgage borrowings and derivative liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2018, our residual interests in securitizations (represented by the difference between total trust assets and total trust liabilities) increased to $17.4 million, compared to $17.3 million at December 31, 2017.
 Since 2007, we have not added any mortgage loans to our long‑term mortgage portfolio.
 For additional information regarding the long‑term mortgage portfolio refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition,” and Note 9. “Securitized Mortgage Trusts” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
 Master Servicing
 Until 2007, we were retaining master servicing rights on substantially all of our non‑conforming single‑family residential and commercial mortgage acquisitions and originations that were sold through securitizations. Since 2008, we have not retained any additional master servicing rights, but have continued to be the master servicer of previously retained master servicing rights.
 The function of a master servicer includes collecting loan payments from loan servicers and remitting loan payments, less master servicing fees receivable and other fees, to a trustee or other purchaser for each series of mortgage‑backed securities or mortgages master serviced. In addition, as master servicer, we monitor compliance with the servicing guidelines and perform or contract with third parties to perform all functions not adequately performed by any loan servicer. The master servicer is also required to advance funds, or cause the loan servicers to advance funds, to cover principal and interest payments not received from borrowers depending on the status of their mortgages, but only to the extent that it is determined that such advances are recoverable either from the borrower or from the liquidation of the property. 
 Master servicing fees are generally 0.03% per annum on the unpaid principal balance of the mortgages serviced. As a master servicer, we also earn income or incur expense on principal and interest payments received from borrowers until those payments are remitted to the investors of those mortgages. Fees from the master servicing portfolio have declined significantly due to a decrease in principal balances since the end of 2008, which in turn affects the amount we earn on balances held in custodial accounts. At December 31, 2018, we were the master servicer for approximately 16,330 mortgages with an UPB of approximately $4.1 billion of which $798 million of those loans were 60 or more days delinquent. At December 31, 2018, we were also the master servicer for unconsolidated securitizations (included in the total master servicing portfolio above) totaling approximately $486 million in unpaid principal balance of which $202 million of those loans were 60 or more days delinquent. Fees earned from master servicing are separate from those earned from mortgage servicing which are generated from servicing rights from new originations since 2011.
 Corporate
 This segment includes all corporate services groups including information technology, human resources, legal, facilities, accounting, treasury and corporate administration. This corporate services group supports all operating segments. A portion of these costs are allocated to the operating segments based on certain allocation methods. These corporate services groups are centralized to be efficient and avoid any duplicate cost burdens. Specific costs associated with being a publicly traded company are not allocated and remain in this segment.

 The corporate segment also includes debt expense related to the Convertible Notes due in 2020, term financing which was repaid in 2017, as well as capital leases. Debt service expense is not allocated and remains in this segment. We have taken advantage of very low financing rates and entered into capital lease arrangements to finance the purchase of equipment, mostly computer equipment, used in all three segments. The interest expense associated with the capital leases is not allocated and remains in this segment.
 Regulation
 The U.S. mortgage industry is heavily regulated. Our mortgage lending operations, as well as our real estate services, are subject to federal, state and local laws that regulate and restrict the manner in which we operate in the residential mortgage industry. Plus, mortgage bankers and brokers in our wholesale production channel and correspondents from which we purchase loans are also subject to regulation, which may have an effect on our business and the mortgage loans we are able to fund or acquire. Compliance with regulations in the mortgage industry requires us to incur costs and expenses in our operations. To the extent we, or others with which we conduct business, do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to fines, reimbursements and other penalties. The laws and regulations that we are subject to include the following:

 In addition, the Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is a sweeping overhaul of the financial regulatory system. The Dodd‑Frank Act increased regulation of the mortgage industry, including: generally prohibiting lenders from making residential mortgage loans unless a good faith determination is made of a borrower’s creditworthiness based on verified and documented information; requiring the CFPB to enact regulations to help assure that consumers are provided with timely and understandable information about residential mortgage loans that protect them against unfair, deceptive and abusive practices; and requiring federal regulators to establish minimum national underwriting guidelines for residential mortgages that lenders will be allowed to securitize without retaining any of the loans’ default risk.
 Our mortgage lending operations is an approved Housing and Urban Development (HUD) lender, a Ginnie Mae approved issuer and servicer and an approved seller/servicer of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As such, we are required to submit annually to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and HUD, as applicable, audited financial statements, or the equivalent, according to the financial reporting requirements of each regulatory entity for its sellers/servicers. Our lending activities are also subject to examination by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, CFPB and state regulatory agencies at any time to assure compliance with applicable regulations, policies and procedures. Also refer to “Regulatory Risks” under Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of regulations that may affect us.
 Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, economic, and technological changes, as well as continued consolidation or expansion. Our competitors include banks, thrifts, credit unions, real estate brokerage firms, mortgage brokers, fintech companies and mortgage banking companies. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates, lending limits and customer convenience. To compete effectively, we must have a very high level of operational, technological, and managerial expertise, as well as access to capital at a competitive cost. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have access to greater financial resources than we do, which can place us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, many of our largest competitors are banks or affiliated with banking institutions, the advantages of which include, but are not limited to, the ability to hold new mortgage loan originations in an investment portfolio and having access to financing with more favorable terms than we do, including lower funding costs with bank deposits as a source of liquidity.
 Our real estate services segment competes with firms that provide similar services, including loan modification companies, real estate asset management and disposition companies and real estate brokerage firms. Our competitors include mega mortgage servicers, established subprime loan servicers, and newer entrants to the specialty servicing and recovery collections business. Efforts to market our ability to provide real estate services for others is more difficult than many of our competitors because we have not historically provided such services to unrelated third parties, and we are not a rated primary or special servicer of residential mortgage loans as designated by a rating agency.
 Risk factors, as outlined below, provide additional information related to risks associated with competition in the mortgage industry.
