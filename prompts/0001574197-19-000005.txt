ITEM 1.    Business 
We are an owner and developer of mixed-use, master-planned communities in California. Our three existing communities have the general plan and zoning approvals necessary for the construction of thousands of homesites and millions of square feet of commercial space, and they represent a significant portion of the real estate available for development in three major markets in California—Los Angeles County, San Francisco County and Orange County. 
Structure and Formation of Our Company 

In 2009, our company was formed as a limited liability company (under the name “Newhall Holding Company, LLC”) to acquire ownership of Newhall Land & Farming. Our management company was originally formed in 2009 as a joint venture between our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Emile Haddad, and Lennar Corporation to manage the properties owned by Newhall Land & Farming and to pursue similar development opportunities. Our management team was an integral part of the team in charge of developing and implementing land strategies on the west coast for Lennar prior to the formation of our management company. Key members of our management team have led the acquisition, entitlement, planning and development of all three of our communities since their inception. Our management team also has long-standing relationships with our principal equityholders, including Lennar. 

In May 2016, we completed the formation transactions to combine the management company with ownership of our three California communities. In the formation transactions, among other things: 


• | we acquired an interest in, and became the managing member of, the San Francisco Venture;


• | we acquired a 37.5% percentage interest in the Great Park Venture, and we became the administrative member of the Great Park Venture; and


• | we acquired the management company, which has historically managed the development of Great Park Neighborhoods and Newhall Ranch.

In August 2017, we acquired a 75% interest in the Gateway Commercial Venture, the entity that owns the Five Point Gateway Campus.
The diagram below presents a simplified depiction of our current organizational structure.
(1) Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we serve as sole managing general partner of the operating company and, as of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 61.7% of the outstanding Class A units of the operating company. We conduct all of our businesses in or through the operating company, which owns, directly or indirectly, equity interests in, and controls the management of, FPL, the San Francisco Venture and the management company. Class A units of the operating company can be exchanged, on a one-for-one basis, for our Class A common shares, subject to certain holding periods. Based on the closing price of our Class A common shares on February 28, 2019, our market capitalization on a fully exchanged basis was approximately $1.2 billion.
(2) The operating company owns all of the outstanding Class B units of the San Francisco Venture. The Class A units of the San Francisco Venture, which the operating company does not own, are intended to be substantially economically equivalent to Class A units of the operating company. As the holder of all outstanding Class B units, the operating company is entitled to receive 99% of available cash from the San Francisco Venture after the holders of Class A units have received distributions equivalent to the distributions, if any, paid on Class A units of the operating company. Class A units of the San Francisco Venture can be exchanged, on a one-for-one basis, for Class A units of the operating company.
(3) We hold our interest in FPL directly and indirectly through the operating company and the management company.
(4) Through a wholly owned subsidiary, the operating company owns a 37.5% percentage interest in the Great Park Venture. Holders of legacy interests in the Great Park Venture are entitled to receive priority distributions in an amount equal to $565.0 million, of which $355.0 million has been distributed as of December 31, 2018. We are the administrative member of the Great Park Venture. Management of the venture is vested in the four voting members, who have a total of five votes. Major decisions generally require the approval of at least 75% of the votes of the voting members. We have two votes, and the other three voting members each have one vote, so we are unable to approve any major decision without the consent or approval of at least two of the other voting members. We do not include the Great Park Venture as a consolidated subsidiary in our consolidated financial statements.
(5) Through a wholly owned subsidiary, the operating company owns a 75% interest in the Gateway Commercial Venture and serves as its manager. However, the manager’s authority is limited. Major decisions by the Gateway Commercial Venture generally require unanimous approval by an executive committee composed of two people designated by us and two people designated by another investor. Some decisions require approval by 
all of the members of the Gateway Commercial Venture. We do not include the Gateway Commercial Venture as a consolidated subsidiary in our consolidated financial statements.
Tax Classification
We have elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, an owner of our shares will not report our items of income, gain, loss and deduction on its U.S. federal income tax return, nor will an owner of our shares receive a Schedule K-1. Our shareholders also will not be subject to state income tax filings in the various states in which we conduct operations as a result of owning our shares. Distributions on our shares will be treated as dividends on corporate stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and will be reported on Form 1099, to the extent applicable. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe the following strengths will provide us with a competitive advantage in implementing our business strategy: 


• | Attractive locations in desirable and supply constrained California coastal markets


• | Significant scale with favorable zoning and entitlements


• | Experienced and proven leadership


• | Expertise in partnering with governmental entities


• | Significant discretion in timing and amount of land development expenditures


• | Flexible capital structure with a conservative operating philosophy

Overview of Business Segments 
Our four reportable segments are Newhall, San Francisco, Great Park and Commercial:

• | Our Newhall segment includes the Newhall Ranch community, as well as other land historically owned by FPL, including 16,000 acres in Ventura County and approximately 500 acres of remnant commercial, residential and open space land in Los Angeles County.

Our Business 

We are primarily engaged in the business of planning and developing our three mixed-use, master-planned communities, and our principal source of revenue is the sale of residential and commercial land sites to homebuilders, commercial developers and commercial buyers. We may also retain a portion of the commercial and multi-family properties in our communities as income-producing assets. 

Our planning and development process involves the following components: 

Master planning.    We design all aspects of our communities, creating highly desirable places to live, work, shop and enjoy an active lifestyle. Our designs include a wide range of amenities, such as high quality schools, parks and recreational areas, entertainment venues and walking and biking trails. Each community is comprised of several villages or neighborhoods, each of which offers a range of housing types, sizes and prices. In addition to the master land planning we undertake for each community, we typically create the floorplans and elevations for each home, as well as the landscape design for each neighborhood, considering each neighborhood’s individual character within the context of the overall plan for the community. For the commercial aspects of our communities, we look for commercial enterprises that will best add value to the community by providing needed services, additional amenities or local jobs. In designing the overall program at each community, we consider the appropriate balance of housing and employment opportunities, access to transportation, resource conservation and enhanced public open spaces and wildlife habitats. We continually evaluate our plans for each community, and make adjustments that we deem appropriate based on changes in local economic factors and other market dynamics. 

Entitlements.    We typically obtain all discretionary entitlements and approvals necessary to develop the infrastructure within our communities and prepare our residential and commercial lots for construction. We also typically obtain all discretionary entitlements and approvals that the homebuilder or commercial builder will need to build homes or commercial buildings on our lots, although we may from time to time allocate responsibility for obtaining certain discretionary entitlements to a homebuilder or commercial builder. Although we have general plan and zoning approvals for our communities, individual development areas within our communities are at various stages of planning and development and have received different levels of discretionary entitlements and approvals. For additional information, see “—Our Communities” below. 

Horizontal development (infrastructure).    We refer to the process of preparing the land for construction of homes or commercial buildings as “horizontal development.” This involves significant investments in a community’s infrastructure and common improvements, including grading and installing roads, sidewalks, gutters, utility improvements (such as storm drains, water, gas, sewer, power and communications), landscaping and shared amenities (such as community buildings, neighborhood parks, trails and open spaces) and other actions necessary to prepare residential and commercial lots for vertical development. 

Land sales.    After horizontal development for a given phase or parcel is completed, graded lots are typically sold to homebuilders, commercial builders or commercial buyers. We typically sell homesites to a diverse group of high-quality homebuilders in a competitive process, although in some cases we may negotiate directly with a single homebuilder. In addition to the base purchase price, our residential land sales typically involve participation provisions that allow us to share in the profits realized by the homebuilders. We sell commercial lots to developers through a competitive process or negotiate directly with the buyer. We also regularly assess our development plan and may retain a portion of the commercial and multi-family properties within our communities as income-producing assets. 

Vertical development (construction).    We refer to the process of building structures (buildings or houses) and preparing them for occupancy as “vertical development.” Single-family residences in our communities are built by third-party homebuilders. Commercial buildings in our communities are usually built by a third-party developer or the buyer. For commercial or multi-family properties that we retain, we may construct the building ourselves or enter into a joint venture with an established developer to construct a particular property (such as a retail development). 

Community programming.    Our community building efforts go beyond development and construction. We offer numerous community events, including music, food and art festivals, outdoor movies, educational programs, health and wellness programs, gardening lessons, cooking lessons, food truck events, bike tours and various holiday festivities. We plan and program all of our events with a goal of building a community that transcends the physical features of our development and connects neighbors through their interests. We believe community building efforts create loyal residents that can become repeat customers within our multi-generational communities. 

Sequencing.    In order to balance the timing of our revenues and expenditures, we typically sequence the development of individual neighborhoods or villages within our communities. As a result, many of the master planning, entitlement, development, sales and other activities described above may occur at the same time in different locations within a single community. Further, depending on the specific plans for each community and market conditions, we may vary the timing of certain of these phases. Throughout this process, we continually analyze each community relative to its market to determine which portions to sell, which portions to build and then sell, and which portions to retain as part of our portfolio of commercial and multi-family properties. 
Our Communities 

Newhall Ranch 

Newhall Ranch is a mixed-use, master-planned community in Los Angeles County that spans approximately 15,000 acres and is designed to include approximately 21,500 homesites, approximately 11.5 million square feet of commercial space, approximately 50 miles of trails, approximately 275 acres of community parks and approximately 10,000 acres of protected open space. The actual commercial square footage and number of homesites are subject to change based on ultimate use and land planning. The land at Newhall Ranch is not subject to any material liens or encumbrances.
Newhall Ranch is located in an unincorporated portion of Los Angeles County along the Santa Clara River in the western portion of the Santa Clarita Valley. The property is located approximately 35 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, 15 miles north of the San Fernando Valley and is adjacent to the City of Santa Clarita. Newhall Ranch is adjacent to Interstate 5 and State Highway 126. Newhall Ranch is also approximately 45 miles north of the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and 21 miles northwest of the Bob Hope Airport (BUR) in Burbank. 
The County of Los Angeles has approved the general plan and zoning for Newhall Ranch. Additionally, we have vesting tentative tract maps for two development areas within Newhall Ranch - Mission Village and Landmark Village. We commenced horizontal development activities for our first development area, Mission Village, in October 2017. We continued horizontal development activities throughout 2018 and expect to start delivering homesites to builders in late 2019. Mission Village is approved to include 4,055 homesites, including a mix of single-family detached homes, single-family attached homes, apartments and for rent affordable units, and approximately 1.6 million square feet of commercial development.
Candlestick Point and The San Francisco Shipyard 

Candlestick Point and The San Francisco Shipyard, located on approximately 800 acres of bayfront property in the City of San Francisco, is designed to include approximately 12,000 homesites, approximately 6.3 million square feet of commercial space, approximately 100,000 square feet of community space, artist studios and approximately 355 acres of parks and open space. The actual commercial square footage and number of homesites are subject to change based on ultimate use and land planning. The land owned by us at Candlestick Point and The San Francisco Shipyard is not subject to any material liens or encumbrances. 

Candlestick Point and The San Francisco Shipyard is located almost equidistant between downtown San Francisco and the San Francisco International Airport (SFO). It consists of two distinct, but contiguous, parcels of real estate. Candlestick Point, the southern parcel, consists of approximately 280 acres on San Francisco’s waterfront. This nationally recognized site was the location of Candlestick Park stadium, former home of the San Francisco 49ers and the San Francisco Giants. The San Francisco Shipyard, the northern parcel, consists of approximately 495 acres on the former site of the Hunters Point Navy Shipyard.
The City and County of San Francisco have approved the general plan and zoning for Candlestick Point and The San Francisco Shipyard. We have vesting tentative tract maps for the remaining development areas within Candlestick Point, and we commenced horizontal development activities there in 2015. We do not yet have vesting tentative tract maps for The San Francisco Shipyard or final maps for any of the remaining development areas. 
At The San Francisco Shipyard, approximately 408 acres are still owned by the U.S. Navy and will not be conveyed to us until the U.S. Navy satisfactorily completes its finding of suitability to transfer, or “FOST,” process, which involves multiple levels of environmental and governmental investigation, analysis, review, comment and approval. Based on our discussions with the U.S. Navy, we had previously expected the U.S. Navy to deliver this property between 2019 and 2022. However, allegations that Tetra Tech, Inc. (“Tetra Tech”), a contractor hired by the U.S. Navy, misrepresented sampling results at The San Francisco Shipyard have resulted in data reevaluation, governmental investigations, criminal proceedings, lawsuits, and a determination by the U.S. Navy and other regulatory agencies to undertake additional sampling. As part of the 2018 Congressional spending bill, the U.S. Department of Defense allocated $36.0 million to help fund resampling efforts at The San Francisco Shipyard. An additional $60.4 million to fund resampling efforts was approved as part of a 2019 military construction spending bill. These activities have delayed the remaining land transfers from the U.S. Navy and could lead to additional legal claims or government investigations, all of which could further delay or impede our future development of such parcels. Our development plans were designed with the flexibility to adjust for potential land transfer delays, and we have the ability to shift the phasing of our development activities to account for delays caused by U.S. Navy retesting, but there can be no assurance that these matters and other related matters that may arise in the future will not materially impact our development plans. Accordingly, our immediate development focus is on our Candlestick Point community that is not subject to land transfers from the U.S. Navy. For additional information about the finding of suitability to transfer process, see “—Regulation—FOST Process.”
The San Francisco Venture previously entered into a project with a joint venture (the “Mall Venture”) between an affiliate of The Macerich Company (“Macerich”) and a venture between Lennar and Castlelake to construct an urban retail outlet shopping district at Candlestick Point (the “Retail Project”). Construction of the Retail Project commenced in 2015 with the demolition of the Candlestick Park stadium and other infrastructure work. In early 2019, however, we and the members of the Mall Venture decided not to proceed with the Retail Project. Accordingly, on February 13, 2019, transactions related to the termination of the Retail Project were consummated, which resulted in the termination of the obligation of the San Francisco Venture to convey parcels of property on which the Retail Project was intended to be developed by the Mall Venture. The San Francisco Venture was also released from certain development obligations. In return, the San Francisco Venture repaid Macerich a $65.1 million obligation related to a promissory note in the same principal amount, plus approximately $5.5 million of accrued interest associated with the promissory note. The San Francisco Venture also issued an aggregate of 436,498 of its Class A units (while we concurrently issued 436,498 Class B common shares) to affiliates of Lennar and Castlelake. The San Francisco Venture can now redevelop these parcels for alternative uses.
Great Park Neighborhoods 

Great Park Neighborhoods, located in Irvine, California, is an approximately 2,100 acre mixed-use, master-planned community that is being developed on the former site of the U.S. Marine Corp’s El Toro Air base (“El Toro Base”) in Orange County. Great Park Neighborhoods is designed to include approximately 9,500 homesites (including up to 1,056 affordable homesites), approximately 4.9 million square feet of commercial space, approximately 61 acres of parks and approximately 138 acres of trails and open space. The actual commercial square footage and number of homesites are subject to change based on ultimate use and land planning. The land at Great Park Neighborhoods is not subject to any material liens or encumbrances.
Great Park Neighborhoods is approximately seven miles from the Pacific Ocean, approximately nine miles from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and approximately 17 miles from Disneyland. It is adjacent to the Orange County Great Park, a metropolitan public park that will be nearly twice the size of New York’s Central Park upon completion. Great Park Neighborhoods is close to Interstate 5, Interstate 405, State Route 133 and John Wayne Airport (SNA) in Orange County.

The City of Irvine has approved the general plan and zoning for Great Park Neighborhoods. We have vesting tentative tract maps for almost all development areas within Great Park Neighborhoods and final maps for many of the development areas. The first homesites were sold in April 2013 and, as of December 31, 2018, the Great Park Venture had sold 5,409 homesites (including 544 affordable homesites) and commercial land allowing for 
development of up to 2 million square feet of commercial (research and development) space. For additional information about the commercial land sale, see “—Commercial” below. 
Commercial
In August 2017, the Gateway Commercial Venture, in which we own a 75% interest, acquired the Five Point Gateway Campus, consisting of approximately 73 acres of commercial land in the Great Park Neighborhoods containing four newly constructed buildings, two of which were leased back to the seller, Broadcom Limited (together with its subsidiaries, “Broadcom”). The Five Point Gateway Campus includes approximately one million square feet consisting of research and development and office space across the four buildings designed to accommodate thousands of employees. Broadcom is the largest tenant, leasing approximately 660,000 square feet of research and development space pursuant to a 20-year triple net lease. We and Lennar have entered into separate 130-month full service gross leases to occupy approximately 135,000 aggregate square feet. 
We currently expect to develop and operate certain commercial properties within our existing master-planned communities. We may develop and operate these properties on our own, or we may choose from time to time to develop and/or operate a particular property or properties in a strategic joint venture or other financing or entity structure with a third-party
Factors we consider in determining whether or not to proceed with a particular commercial investment include (1) our existing knowledge of the master-planned communities we are currently developing and understanding their respective needs, (2) whether, in our judgment, a particular commercial property or investment will create additional value for our remaining land within the community, in addition to achieving desired investment returns on such property or investment on a stand-alone basis, (3) existing entitlements and our ability to change them, (4) compatibility of the physical site with our proposed uses, and (5) environmental considerations, traffic patterns and access to the site.
Other Properties 

We own approximately 16,000 acres in Ventura County that are primarily used for agriculture and energy operations. We also own approximately 500 acres of remnant commercial, residential and open space land in Los Angeles County that is planned to be sold or deeded to third parties over the next five years. 
Development Management Services 

Through the management company, we receive fees for providing development management services for Great Park Neighborhoods and for providing property management services to the Gateway Commercial Venture. 
Additionally, we provide certain (but not all) development management services to other ventures in which Lennar is an investor and to the Lennar-CL Venture in connection with their involvement in real estate activities at The San Francisco Shipyard. We also provided certain development management services to the Lennar-CL Venture related to the Retail Project at the Candlestick Point community until early 2019. 
Competition 

We compete with other residential, retail and commercial property developers in the development of properties in the Northern and Southern California markets. Significant factors that we believe allow us to compete effectively in this business include: 

• | the size and scope of our mixed-use, master-planned communities;


• | the recreational and cultural amenities available within our communities;


• | the commercial centers in our communities;


• | our relationships with homebuilders; and


• | the proximity of our communities to major metropolitan areas.

Seasonality 
Our business and results of operations are not materially impacted by seasonality. 
Regulation 

Entitlement Process 

Land use and zoning authority is exercised by local municipalities through the adoption of ordinances, regulations or zoning codes to direct the use and development of private property by controlling the use, size, density and location of and access to developments on private land. Such ordinances, regulations or codes typically divide uses of land into two categories—permitted uses and discretionary uses. Permitted uses are presumptively permitted, while discretionary uses are subject to a discretionary approval process, usually involving an application, an environmental review and a public hearing with input from other locally affected property owners and stake holders. In order to grant a discretionary use entitlement, the municipality must find that the use does not negatively impact surrounding properties and may condition such an entitlement with special requirements or limitations unique to each individual case. We typically obtain all discretionary entitlements and approvals necessary to develop the infrastructure within our communities and prepare our residential and commercial lots for construction. We also typically obtain all discretionary entitlements and approvals that the homebuilder or commercial builder will need to build homes or commercial buildings on our lots, although we may from time to time allocate responsibility for obtaining certain discretionary entitlements to a homebuilder or commercial builder. 
We have incurred significant costs and expenses over the last 10 to 15 years in order to obtain the primary entitlements (general plan and zoning approvals) for our communities. Once these primary entitlements are obtained, we continue to refine the master plan for each community by planning specific development areas and obtaining the necessary governmental approvals for a development area. Among other things, we typically need to obtain the following approvals for each development area: (1) approval of the subdivision maps (such as vesting tentative tract maps and parcel maps) that allow the land to be divided into separate legal lots for residential, commercial and other improvements; (2) approval of the improvement plans that set forth certain design, engineering and other elements of infrastructure, parks, homes, commercial buildings and other improvements; (3) approval of the final map that allows for the conveyance of individual homesites and commercial lots; and (4) any other discretionary approvals needed to construct, finance, sell, lease or maintain the homes or commercial buildings within a development area. 

We may also need to obtain state and federal permits for land development activities in certain development areas, including, for example, permits and approvals issued by state and federal resource agencies authorizing impacts to species covered by endangered species acts or impacts to state and federal waters or wetlands. 

Development areas within our communities are at various stages of planning and development and, therefore, have received different levels of discretionary entitlements and approvals. In some cases, development areas have obtained entitlements and approvals allowing homes and commercial buildings to be built and sold, and in other cases development areas require further discretionary entitlements or approvals prior to the commencement of construction. In still other cases, our approvals have been challenged by third parties. For additional information on current legal challenges, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.” 

Environmental Matters 

Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge 
of hazardous or toxic substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, in, under or migrating from such property, including costs to investigate and clean up such contamination and liability for damage to natural resources. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. These liabilities could be substantial and the cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or other costs could exceed the value of the property or our aggregate assets. In addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability for costs of remediation or personal or property damage or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop our properties or to borrow using the properties as collateral. In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. Such remaining contamination encountered during our construction and development activities also may require investigation or remediation, and we could incur costs or experience construction delays as a result of such discoveries. 

Some of our properties were used in the past for commercial or industrial purposes, or are currently used for commercial purposes, that involve or involved the use of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or are adjacent to or near properties that have been or are used for similar commercial or industrial purposes. As a result, some of our properties have been or may be impacted by contamination arising from the releases of such substances. For example, oil and gas wells have formerly operated or are currently operating at Newhall Ranch. In certain cases, prior owners or operators have in the past investigated or remediated, or are currently investigating or remediating, such conditions, but contamination may continue to be present at these sites, and future remedial activities could delay or otherwise impede property development on sites where contamination is present. 
In addition, The San Francisco Shipyard and Great Park Neighborhoods properties were formerly operated by the U.S. Navy as defense plants. As a result of these historic operations, portions of these properties have been or currently are listed on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (“USEPA”) National Priorities List as sites requiring cleanup under federal environmental laws. While investigation and cleanup activities have been substantially completed for Great Park Neighborhoods, significant work is contemplated over the next few years for certain parcels within The San Francisco Shipyard, which will delay the transfer of such parcels to us for development. 

The National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) requires federal agencies to integrate environmental values into their decision making processes by considering the environmental impacts of their proposed actions and reasonable alternatives to those actions. To meet NEPA requirements federal agencies prepare a detailed statement known as an Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”). Additionally, all Department of Defense installations (such as The San Francisco Shipyard and the El Toro Base) selected for closure or realignment pursuant to the Base Closure and Realignment Acts of 1988 or 1990 and being considered for transfer by deed, and where a release or disposal of hazardous substances or petroleum products has occurred, are subject to an environmental review process and may not be transferred until a finding of suitability for transfer (“FOST”) is documented. In addition, our development projects are subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”), which is similar in scope to NEPA, and requires potential environmental impacts of projects subject to discretionary governmental approval to be studied by the California governmental entity approving the proposed projects. Projects with significant expected impacts require an Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) while more limited projects may be approved based on a Mitigated Negative Declaration. All of our development sites and projects have either been or continue to be investigated, remediated or reviewed (with documented EISs, FOSTs and EIRs, as applicable) in accordance with the above-described and other applicable environmental laws to determine the suitability of their proposed uses and to protect human health and the environment. 

New or additional permitting requirements, new interpretations of requirements, changes in our operations or litigation or community objections over the adequacy of conducted reviews and other response and mitigation actions could also trigger the need for either amended or new reviews or actions, which could result in increased costs or delays of, modification of, or denial of rights to conduct, our development programs. For additional information on legal challenges to our projects under environmental laws see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.” 

When we identify conditions that require a response under environmental laws, we endeavor to address identified contamination or mitigate risks associated with such contamination as required (or ensure that such actions are taken by other parties, such as prior owners and operators); however, we cannot assure you that we will not need to take additional action, incur additional costs, or delay or modify our development plans to address these conditions or other environmental conditions that may be discovered in the future. As a result of the foregoing, we could potentially incur material liabilities. 

We are also subject to a variety of other local, state, federal and other laws and regulations concerning the environment, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges and use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given property vary according to multiple factors, including the property’s location, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the property, as well as adjoining properties. These issues may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. For example, in those cases where wetlands or an endangered or threatened species are impacted by proposed development, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in such identified environmentally sensitive areas. 

Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos-containing materials (“ACM”), and may impose fines and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements or expose us to third-party liability (such as liability for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos). Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing ACM (and employers in such buildings) properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately notify or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. In addition, soils at Candlestick Point and The San Francisco Shipyard are known to contain naturally occurring asbestos, which must be managed, including through dust management plans. In the past, we have been subject to penalties for failure to monitor asbestos dust during development activities at The San Francisco Shipyard, and, although we endeavor to maintain (and to cause our contractors to maintain) compliance, we could incur such fines or penalties in the future. 

FOST Process 

The U.S. Navy is implementing its cleanup program at The San Francisco Shipyard pursuant to various federal laws and authorities. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) requires the U.S. Navy to remediate The San Francisco Shipyard in accordance with a federal facilities agreement entered into with the USEPA and the State of California, which sets forth procedures and timeframes for remedial decisions and deliverables. In accordance with the federal facilities agreement, the National Contingency Plan, 40 C.F.R. Part 300 and Department of Defense procedures, the U.S. Navy’s cleanup process involves (1) preparation of a series of reports documenting various investigative and remedial activities and (2) securing approval of those reports from the USEPA and the State of California. The remedial steps and related reports, each of which is subject to review, comment and approval, are as follows: 

Preliminary assessment/site inspection.    This is an initial review of the site, including review of historical records and visual inspections. Limited sampling and analysis of soil, surface water and groundwater may also occur. 

Remedial investigation.    The remedial investigation involves a closer look into each of the areas of concern identified in the preliminary assessment/site inspection, and involves collecting and analyzing samples of multiple media (soil, soil gas, sediment, groundwater, etc.). The remedial investigation addresses the nature and extent of contamination at each area of concern identified in the parcel. The remedial investigation also includes preparation of a Human Health Risk Assessment and an Ecological Risk Assessment, as appropriate. The Human Health Risk Assessment identifies the contaminants that could pose a health risk under different exposure scenarios and identifies potential numeric remediation goals. 

Feasibility study.    The feasibility study evaluates the effectiveness, implementability and cost of various alternative remedial technologies that could be used to reduce site risk to acceptable levels, based on the results of the risk assessment and other data collected during the remedial investigation. 

Proposed plan.    The proposed plan summarizes the findings of the remedial investigation and proposes a preferred remedial approach for each area of concern in the parcel based on the options evaluated in the feasibility study. This step includes a public meeting to provide the public with relevant information and an opportunity to comment on the preferred cleanup alternative. 

Record of decision.    Once the U.S. Navy, the USEPA and the State of California select and approve the remedy for the parcel, the U.S. Navy documents and publishes the decision in the record of decision, which responds to all comments on the proposed plan. 

Remedial design.    The remedial design sets forth details of how the remedies identified in the record of decision will be carried out. The remedial design includes a detailed engineering design for implementing, operating and maintaining the selected cleanup alternative. The U.S. Navy also distributes a fact sheet to the public before beginning work on the cleanup. 

Remedial action work plan/remedial action implementation.    The U.S. Navy conducts remedial action in accordance with an approved remedial action work plan, which is based on the remedial design. 

Remedial action completion report.    Once complete, the cleanup is documented in a remedial action completion report. 

FOST.    Prior to conveyance of real property, CERCLA requires the U.S. Navy to remediate hazardous substances to a level consistent with the protection of human health and the environment. Following the completion and approval of the remedial action completion report, the U.S. Navy documents its findings that such remediation has occurred, and that the property is suitable for transfer, consistent with all applicable laws and authorities, in a FOST. 

Investment Policies 
Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate 
We are a real estate development and operating company that specializes in the development and operation of mixed-use, master-planned communities. Our goal is to create sustainable, long-term growth and value for our shareholders. We do not currently have an investment policy; however, our board of directors may adopt one in the future.
We expect to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership, development, operation and disposition of our communities: (1) Newhall Ranch; (2) Candlestick Point and The San Francisco Shipyard; and (3) Great Park Neighborhoods. Although we currently have no definitive agreements to acquire other properties, we may do so in the future. Our future investment or development activities will not necessarily be limited to any geographic area, product type or to a specified percentage of our assets. 
We may also participate with third parties in property ownership, development and operation, through joint ventures, private equity real estate funds or other types of co-ownership. We also may acquire real estate or interests in real estate in exchange for the issuance of our Class A common shares, our preferred shares, options to purchase shares or Class A units of the operating company. These types of investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting our diversification and, therefore, provide us with flexibility in structuring our portfolio. 
We will limit our investment in any securities so that we do not fall within the definition of an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
Investments in Real Estate Mortgages 
We may, at the discretion of our board of directors, invest in mortgages and other types of real estate interests, but we do not currently, nor do we currently intend to, engage in these activities. If we choose to invest in mortgages, we would expect to invest in mortgages secured by real property interests. The Company does not have a policy that restricts the proportion of our assets that may be invested in a type of mortgage or any single mortgage or type of mortgage loan. 
Securities of, or Interests in, Persons Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities and Other Issuers 
We do not currently intend to invest in securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. However, we may do so in the future. 
Investments in Other Securities 
Other than as described above and for short-term securities pending long-term commitment, we do not currently intend to invest in any additional securities such as bonds, preferred shares or common shares. 
Employees 
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 180 employees.
