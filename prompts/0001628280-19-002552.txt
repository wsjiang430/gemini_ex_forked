Item 1.    Business
Overview
Great Ajax Corp. is a Maryland corporation that is organized and operated in a manner intended to allow us to qualify as a REIT. We primarily target acquisitions of re-performing loans ("RPLs"), including residential mortgage loans and small balance commercial (“SBC”) loans. RPLs are mortgage loans on which at least five of the seven most recent payments have been made, or the most recent payment has been made and accepted pursuant to an agreement, or the full dollar amount to 
1

cover at least five payments has been paid in the last seven months. We opportunistically originate SBC loans that have a principal balance of up to $5.0 million and are secured by multi-family residential and commercial mixed use retail/residential properties. Purchased SBC loans are generally RPLs. Additionally, we may invest in single-family and smaller commercial properties directly either through a foreclosure event of a loan in our mortgage portfolio or through a direct acquisition. We may also target investments in non-performing loans (“NPL”). NPLs are loans on which the most recent three payments have not been made. We may acquire NPLs either directly or with joint venture partners. We own a 19.8% equity interest in our Manager and an 8.0% equity interest in the parent company of our Servicer. GA-TRS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership that owns the equity interest in the Manager and the Servicer. We have elected to treat GA-TRS as a taxable REIT subsidiary under the Code. Our mortgage loans and real properties are serviced by the Servicer, also an affiliated company.
In 2014, we formed Great Ajax Funding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, to act as the depositor of mortgage loans into securitization trusts and to hold the subordinated securities issued by such trusts and any additional trusts we may form for additional secured borrowings. AJX Mortgage Trust I and AJX Mortgage Trust II are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership formed to hold mortgage loans used as collateral for financings under the our repurchase agreements. On February 1, 2015, we formed GAJX Real Estate LLC, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, to own, maintain, improve and sell certain REO purchased by us. We have elected to treat GAJX Real Estate LLC as a TRS under the Code.
In 2018, we formed GAEA Real Estate Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating partnership. We have elected to treat GAEA Real Estate Corp. as a TRS under the Code. Also during 2018, we formed GAEA Real Estate Operating Partnership, a wholly owned subsidiary of GAEA Real Estate Corp., to hold investments in commercial real estate assets. We also formed BLFD Holdings LLC, GAEA Commercial Properties LLC, GAEA Commercial Finance LLC and GAEA RE LLC. All entities are wholly owned subsidiaries with the exception of BLFD Holdings, of which 10% is owned by a third party investors.
We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our capital stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, and that our current intended manner of operation enables us to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Strategy
We are continuing the opportunistic strategy developed by our Manager’s management team in a REIT structure that we believe provides us access to capital and allows us to compete for more significant investment opportunities in the evolving mortgage markets. This strategy enables us to generate attractive current yields and risk-adjusted total returns for our stockholders. We intend to continue to distribute substantially all of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders in accordance with applicable REIT qualification requirements. Our strategy consists of:

• | constructing and owning a portfolio of residential RPLs and SBC loans at discounts to UPB and significant discounts to underlying property values;​


• | expanding our acquisitions of RPLs, SBC loans, and limited acquisitions of NPLs through joint ventures;


• | constructing a portfolio of smaller multi-family and mixed use retail/residential/office properties;​


• | constructing concentrations of investments in geographic areas, cities and neighborhoods with certain demographic and economic trends and attributes;​


• | working, through our Servicer, to (1) support the continued performance of RPLs; (2) convert a portion of our NPLs to performing status; (3) determine the optimal loss mitigation strategy on an asset-by-asset basis; and (4) manage the process and timelines for converting NPLs to sale or rental REO;​


• | when economically efficient, securitizing our RPL portfolio to create long-term, fixed rate, non-recourse financing, while retaining one or more tranches of any subordinated securities we may create; ​


• | opportunistically mitigating our interest rate and prepayment risk, including, potentially, through the use of a variety of hedging instruments; and

2


• | working through joint ventures with third party investors to acquire pools of mortgage loans and other mortgage related assets, which may create value additive opportunities for us, our Manager (an affiliated entity), and our Servicer (an affiliated entity). Depending upon the needs, liquidity and risk profiles of our third party investors, the criteria for asset acquisitions by our joint ventures may differ somewhat from​ the criteria we would use for asset acquisitions intended exclusively for our own portfolio.​

We believe that purchasing RPLs at a discount to UPB and a significant discount to underlying property values, as well as working, through our Servicer, to support continuing or new payments by borrowers, allows us to achieve our targeted returns. However, if actual results differ from our assumptions, particularly if the value of the underlying properties were to decrease significantly, we may not achieve our targeted returns.
We price each loan pool we acquire on a loan-by-loan basis and focus on acquiring loans with the underlying property located in or in close proximity to urban centers where we believe that HPA will outpace the national market. We use proprietary models to predict probabilistic future cash flows for each loan and generate cash flow projections. Factors affecting our cash flow projections include resolution method, resolution timeline, foreclosure costs, rehabilitation costs and eviction costs. Some of the variables used are the specific location of the underlying property, loan-to-value ratio, property age and condition, change and rate of change of borrower credit rating, servicing notes, interest rate, monthly payment amount and neighborhood rents. For loan pool acquisitions, we target a 6.5–10% return on RPLs, including SBC loans, and a 8-17% return on NPLs, without taking into account or giving effect to any borrowings, which we refer to as an unlevered return. We analyze each RPL for re-default probability, loan-to-value ratio, interest rate and structure of the loan and the likely resolution method in the event the loan stops performing. Each RPL is analyzed through both a performing and non-performing path.
While we expect to purchase loans and real properties nationwide, we target urban centers (including densely populated suburbs) because we believe that an increasing number of families and young professionals prefer to live in areas that are in close proximity to employment centers, public transportation and retail and other amenities that are typically more common in such areas, creating liquidity and predictability, which we believe, provides greater potential for HPA. By focusing on urban centers and targeted densely populated suburbs we are able to more efficiently manage our portfolio and scale our Servicer's high-touch loan servicing platform. Our Manager has compiled data that suggests that HPA can vary significantly from neighborhood to neighborhood even within the same city. Our Manager’s proprietary analytics include inputs for economic and demographic data that includes unemployment rates, housing starts, crime rates, education, electoral participation and other variables that we believe closely correlate to property values. These analytics help us determine cities, neighborhoods and properties that we believe will experience HPA.
We seek to build concentrations of loans and real properties in certain markets. These markets include, but are not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles and San Diego, California; Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Orlando and Tampa, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; New York and New Jersey metropolitan area; Houston and Dallas, Texas; Portland, OR; and Maryland and Virginia near Washington, DC. In addition to its experienced servicing staff, our Servicer has contracted with local experts in areas where it services a significant number of loans that provide local area market intelligence, monitor properties and can manage rehabilitation projects for REO or repairs for rental properties. We believe having affiliated local experts and a centralized management team provides us a competitive advantage and leads to more informed decision-making and better execution.
The following provides further detail as to our RPL and SBC loan acquisition strategy:

• | We believe that buying RPLs is more efficient and lower risk than acquiring single-family REO. We purchase RPLs at a discount from UPB and a significant discount to underlying property value, but the borrower is required to pay interest on the full UPB, leading to a higher current yield. The borrower is also responsible for property taxes, insurance and maintenance, which are all costs that the owner of a REO would otherwise have to pay. In addition, to the extent that the UPB exceeds the home’s or commercial property’s value, the lender will benefit from all price appreciation, net of carrying and liquidation costs, until such time as the price exceeds the UPB plus any arrearages and expenses. While the return to the mortgage loan owner is thus capped, there is also risk mitigation if the REO value decreases, until the value is less than the price the lender paid for the loan.​


• | The histories of distressed mortgage loans often provide more insight into the likelihood of default than acquiring newly originated mortgage loans, which should allow our Manager to model default risk and price acquisitions more accurately.​


• | If an RPL becomes an NPL, we, through the Servicer, have a number of ways to mitigate our loss. These loss mitigation techniques include working with the borrower to achieve performance, including through modification of the mortgage loan terms as well as short sale, assisted deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, assisted deed-for-lease, foreclosure and other loss mitigation activities. With each REO acquired, we assess the best potential return, typically either

3

through rental, sale with carryback financing, which we believe will increase the potential pool of purchasers, or sale without our financing the purchase.​

• | We believe that we are able to purchase mortgage loans at lower prices than single-family REO properties because sellers of such loans are able to avoid paying the costs typically associated with sales of real estate, whether single-family residences or smaller commercial properties, such as broker commissions and closing costs of up to 10% of gross proceeds of the sale. We believe this motivates sellers to accept lower prices for the RPLs than they would if selling REO directly.​​


• | We believe concentrated acquisitions of mixed use retail/residential/office properties in our target markets is more efficient than acquisitions of single-family homes to hold as rentals.

Our comprehensive loan and property history database and data tracking lead to a deep understanding of our markets. This understanding, coupled with our long-term relationships with loan sellers, we believe allows us to purchase loans at a discount to UPB and a significant discount to current property values. Our database contains foreclosure timelines on an individual county basis and in some instances, also on an individual judge basis. In addition to resolution timeline data, we track data by state, MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area) and zip code regarding crime rates, education, electoral participation and other variables that we believe closely correlate with property values.
Our strategy is adaptable to changing market environments, subject to compliance with the income and other tests, which allows us to continue to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and to maintain our exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. As a result, our acquisition and management decisions depend on prevailing market conditions, and our targeted investments may vary over time in response to market conditions. We may change our strategy and policies without a vote of our stockholders. Moreover, although our independent directors will periodically review our investment guidelines and our portfolio, they generally will not review particular proposed asset acquisitions or asset management decisions. See “— Investment Guidelines.”
Our Portfolio
The following table outlines the carrying value of our portfolio of mortgage loan assets and single-family and smaller commercial properties as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 ($ in millions):

 | As of December 31,
Our portfolio at year-end: | 2018 | | 2017
RPL Residential Mortgage Loans | $ | 1,242.2 | | | $ | 1,190.0
RPL SBC Loans | 21.2 | | | 8.6 | 
Originated SBC Loans | 11.1 | | | 11.6 | 
NPLs | 36.3 | | | 43.3 | 
REO | 37.0 | | | 26.2 | 
Investment in debt securities | 146.8 | | | 6.3 | 
Investment in beneficial interests | 22.1 | | | — | 
Total Real Estate Assets | $ | 1,516.7 | | | $ | 1,286.0

We closely monitor the status of our mortgage loans and, through our Servicer, work with our borrowers to improve their payment records.
Investment Process
We value our portfolio on a loan-by-loan and property-by-property basis. Purchase prices generally are at a discount to UPB and a significant discount to current property value, based in part on up to two unaffiliated broker price opinions (“BPOs”) for every property. Employees and agents of our Manager periodically view the exteriors of properties prior to completion of due diligence and the information from such visits is incorporated into final loan pricing negotiations with the sellers.
We estimate our resolution timelines using a combination of proprietary data, modeling and historical trends. Our analysis of the resolution or foreclosure timeline for a mortgage loan is based on its history to date with added time cushion. We have developed a robust database of foreclosure timelines on an individual county basis and, in some instances, on an individual judge basis. We also use statistical models to determine the expected modification success probability and the expected short sale success probabilities. We have an extensive due diligence process to validate data consistency, accuracy and compliance and to perform document and third-party lien reviews on all loan files.

The most important factors in analyzing RPLs are the level and duration of continued re-performance, the potential for HPA, prevailing interest rates, the potential for economic growth and the availability of financing for the borrower. The analysis of all mortgage loan and REO acquisitions is also affected by the supply of existing housing and rate of housing starts as higher construction costs, particularly if replacement cost is greater than market price, can slow the rate of starts and new housing inventory and lead to rising rental rates relative to mortgage payments. We evaluate geographic location priorities based on many different factors and data, including, but not limited to, employment rates and the local mismatch between employment rates and housing supply, demographic shifts, cost of new construction, social services, education, crime and voting participation rates.
The following graphic outlines the process the Manager generally uses for assessing RPL and NPL portfolio purchase opportunities:
Investment Guidelines
All of our investment activities are conducted by our Manager on our behalf pursuant to the Management Agreement. Our principal objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long-term through dividends and capital appreciation.
Our board of directors ("Board of Directors") has adopted an investment policy designed to facilitate the management of our capital and assets and the maintenance of an investment portfolio profile that meets our objectives. The investment policy will help the Board of Directors oversee our efforts to achieve a return on assets consistent with our business objectives and to maintain adequate liquidity to meet any financial covenants and regular cash requirements.
Any purchase of RPLs, SBC loans or real property is analyzed by the portfolio acquisition group. Our Manager may, without a vote of our stockholders, consider any investment consistent with our investment policy. We may also acquire single-family homes, smaller multi-family residential properties, smaller mixed use retail/residential/office properties and smaller commercial properties either upon foreclosure or other settlement of our owned NPLs or in the market and opportunistically either sell such property, including offering mortgage loans to the purchasers, or holding it as a rental for the short or long term.
Our Manager is authorized to finance our investment positions through repurchase agreements, secured debt and other financing arrangements, provided such agreements are negotiated with counterparties approved by the investment committee. Our Manager believes it is critical to structure any financing facilities to significantly limit the risk to our business from falling collateral values and margin calls. We fund many of our asset acquisitions with non-recourse securitizations in which the underlying collateral is not marked-to-market and employ repurchase agreements without the obligation to mark-to-market the underlying collateral to the extent available. We may also hedge our interest rate exposure on our financing activities through 
5

the use of interest rate swaps, forwards, futures and options, subject to prior approval from the investment committee, though no such hedges are currently in use. We also acquire loans and other real estate assets through joint ventures. 
Our Board of Directors has adopted the following additional investment guidelines:

• | investments and acquisitions that exceed 15% of our equity from time to time must be approved by the Investment Supervisory Committee of our Board of Directors;​


• | no investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes;​


• | no investment shall be made that would cause us to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act;​


• | our assets will be invested within our target assets, as described above; and​


• | until appropriate investments can be identified, we may pay off short-term debt or invest the proceeds of any offering in interest-bearing, short-term investments, including funds that are consistent with qualifying and maintaining our qualification as a REIT.​

Our investment policy and guidelines may be changed from time to time by our Board of Directors without the approval of our stockholders.
Broad Investment Policy Risks
Our investment policy is very broad and, therefore, our Manager has great latitude in determining the types of assets that are appropriate investments for us, as well as the individual investment decisions. In the future, our Manager may make investments on our behalf with lower rates of return than those anticipated under current market conditions and/or may make investments with greater risks to achieve those anticipated returns. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews our investment policy and guidelines and our investment portfolio but does not review or approve each proposed investment by our Manager unless it falls outside our previously approved investment policy or constitutes a related party transaction. In conducting periodic reviews, our Board of Directors relies primarily on information provided to it by our Manager. Transactions entered into by our Manager may be costly, difficult or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed by our Board of Directors.
In addition, we may change our business strategy and investment policy and targeted asset classes at any time without the consent of our stockholders, and this could result in our making investments that are different in type from, and possibly riskier, than our current investments or the investments currently contemplated. Changes in our investment strategy and investment policy and targeted asset classes may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, counterparty risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations, which could materially and adversely affect us.
Policies with Respect to Certain Transactions
Other than (i) transactions in which our Servicer is the holder of record because we or our subsidiaries may not hold the necessary license to hold those assets directly, but where we are the beneficial owner of at least 95% of the participation rights in those assets, or (ii) as approved by a majority of the independent members of our Board of Directors, we generally will not purchase portfolio assets from, or sell them to, our directors or officers or to our Manager, Aspen or any of their affiliates or engage in any transaction in which they have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest, including in connection with the securitization of any of our mortgage loan assets (other than our agreements with our Manager, the Servicer and Aspen described in more detail herein) without the consent of the Investment Supervisory Committee of the Board of Directors.
Policies with Respect to Certain Other Activities
We intend to raise additional funds through future offerings of equity or debt securities or the retention of cash flow (subject to REIT distribution requirements) or a combination of these methods. In the event that our Board of Directors determines to raise additional equity capital, it has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate, at any time, subject to compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
In addition, we expect to borrow money to finance or refinance the acquisition of RPLs, SBC loans and REO and for general corporate purposes, and we may borrow to finance the payment of dividends. Our investment policy, the assets in our portfolio, the decision to use leverage and the appropriate level of leverage will be based on our Manager’s assessment of a variety of factors, including our historical and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, financing covenants, the cash flow generation capability of assets, the availability of credit on favorable terms, our outlook for borrowing costs relative to the unlevered yields on our assets, our intention to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT and exemption from the Investment Company Act, applicable law, and other factors, as our Board of Directors may deem relevant 
6

from time to time. Our decision to use leverage is at our Manager’s discretion and is not subject to the approval of our stockholders. We are not restricted by our governing documents in the amount of leverage that we may use.
We may also invest in the securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control over such entities or with the intention of realizing short-term or long-term gains. We do not intend that our investments in securities will require us to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, and we would intend to divest such securities before any such registration would be required. We do not intend to underwrite securities of other issuers. We finance our assets with what we believe to be a prudent amount of leverage, which will vary from time to time based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio, availability of financing and market conditions. We have funded and intend to continue to fund our asset acquisitions with non-recourse securitizations in which the underlying collateral is not marked-to-market and employ repurchase agreements without the obligation to mark to market the underlying collateral to the extent available. Our repurchase agreements include terms ranging from a maximum borrowing base of 85% of market value to 70% of purchase price, not to exceed 65% of property value. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a description of our securitizations, our repurchase financing facility and any other outstanding indebtedness.
In a repurchase agreement, we sell an asset to a counterparty at a discounted value, or the loan amount, and simultaneously agree to repurchase the same asset from such counterparty at a price equal to the loan amount plus interests. Despite being legally structured as sales and subsequent repurchases, repurchase agreements are generally accounted for as debt secured by the underlying assets. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we generally receive the income and other payments distributed with respect to the underlying assets, and pay interest to the counterparty. While the proceeds of our repurchase agreement financings are often used to purchase additional assets subject to the same repurchase agreement, our financing arrangements are not expected to restrict our ability to use proceeds from these arrangements to support our other liquidity needs. Our repurchase agreement arrangements are typically documented under the standard form master repurchase agreement of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, with the ability for both parties to request margin. Given daily market volatility, we and our repurchase agreement counterparties are required to post additional margin collateral to each other from time to time as part of the normal course of our business. Our repurchase agreement financing counterparties generally have the right to determine the value of the underlying collateral for purposes of determining the amount of margin, subject to the terms and conditions of our agreement with the counterparty, including, in certain cases, our right to dispute the counterparty’s valuation determination.
We may utilize other types of borrowings in the future, including, but not limited to, debt financing through bank credit facilities, warehouse lines of credit and structured financing arrangements, among others. We may also seek to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of debt or equity securities, depending upon market conditions. However, there can be no assurance as to how much additional financing capacity such efforts will produce, what form the financing will take or that such efforts will be successful. If we are unable to expand our sources of financing, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
Our use of leverage, especially in order to increase the amount of assets supported by our capital base, may have the effect of increasing losses when these assets underperform. Our charter, bylaws and investment policies require no minimum or maximum leverage and our investment and risk management committees have the discretion, subject to the oversight of our Board of Directors, to change both our overall leverage and the leverage used for individual asset classes. Because our strategy is flexible, dynamic and opportunistic, our overall leverage will vary over time and our Board of Directors believes it is appropriate to apply higher leverage to higher quality assets. 
We currently do not hedge the risk associated with the mortgage loans and real estate underlying our portfolios. However, we may undertake risk mitigation activities with respect to our debt financing interest rate obligations. We expect that our debt financing may at times be based on a floating rate of interest calculated on a fixed spread over the relevant index, as determined by the particular financing arrangement. A significantly rising interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on the cost of our financing. To mitigate this risk, we may use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and interest rate options in an effort to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in the interest rates we pay on our debt, subject to our maintaining compliance with the terms of the no-action letter so that we are not treated as a commodity pool operator for purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act. See “— Operating and Regulatory Structure — Commodity Pool Operator Exemption.”
These derivative transactions will be entered into solely for risk management purposes, not for investment purposes. When undertaken, these derivative instruments likely will expose us to certain risks such as price and interest rate fluctuations, timing risk, volatility risk, credit risk, counterparty risk and changes in the liquidity of markets. Therefore, although we expect to transact in these derivative instruments purely for risk management, they may not adequately protect us from fluctuations in our financing interest rate obligations.
The Management Agreement
7

We are a party to the Management Agreement with the Manager, which expires on July 8, 2029 and which we have 19.8% ownership in. Under the Management Agreement, the Manager implements our business strategy and manages our business and investment activities and day-to-day operations, subject to oversight by our Board of Directors. Among other services, the Manager, directly or through affiliates, provides us with a management team and necessary administrative and support personnel. Additionally, we pay directly for services related to internal audit, a function that reports to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We do not currently have any employees paid directly by us and do not expect to have any other employees that are paid directly by us in the foreseeable future. Each of our executive officers is an employee or officer, or both, of the Manager or the Servicer.
Under the Management Agreement, we pay both a base management fee and an incentive fee to the Manager.
The base management fee equals 1.5% of our stockholders’ equity per annum, including equity equivalents such as our recent issuance of convertible senior notes, and is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears. For purposes of calculating the management fee, our stockholders’ equity means: the sum of (i) the net proceeds from any issuances of common stock or other equity securities we or the Operating Partnership have issued (without double counting) since inception (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), and (ii) our and our Operating Partnership’s (without double counting) retained earnings calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, ("U.S. GAAP,") at the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter (without taking into account any non-cash equity compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods), less (A) any amount that we or our Operating Partnership pays to repurchase shares of common stock or outstanding limited partnership units of our Operating Partnership ("OP Units") since inception, (B) any unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash items that have affected consolidated stockholders’ equity as reported in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and (C) one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP, and certain non-cash items not otherwise described above, in each case after discussions between the Manager and our independent directors and approval by a majority of our independent directors. As a result, our stockholders’ equity, for purposes of calculating the management fee, could be greater or less than the amount of stockholders’ equity shown on our consolidated financial statements.
The initial $1.0 million of the quarterly base management fee is payable 75% in cash and 25% in shares of our common stock. Any amount of the base management fee in excess of $1.0 million is payable in shares of our common stock until payment is 50% in cash and 50% in shares (the “50/50 split”). Any remaining amount of the quarterly base management fee after the 50/50 split threshold is reached is payable in equal amounts of cash and shares. The quantity of common stock is determined using the higher of the most recently reported book value or the average of the closing prices of our common stock on the NYSE on the five business days after the date on which the most recent regular quarterly dividend to holders of our common stock is paid. The Manager has agreed to hold any shares of common stock it receives as payment of the base management fee for at least three years from the date such shares of common stock are received.
The Manager is also entitled to an incentive fee, payable quarterly and calculated in arrears, of 20% of the amount by which total dividends on our common stock and distributions on OP units exceeds 8% of book value. However, no incentive fee may be paid to the Manager with respect to any calendar quarter unless our cumulative core earnings, defined as U.S. GAAP net income or loss less non-cash equity compensation, unrealized gains or losses from mark-to-market adjustments, one-time adjustments to earnings resulting from changes to U.S. GAAP, and certain other non-cash items, is greater than zero for the most recently completed eight calendar quarters. In the event that the payment of the quarterly base management fee has not reached the 50/50 split, all of the incentive fee is payable in shares of our common stock until the 50/50 split occurs. In the event that the total payment of the quarterly base management fee and the incentive fee has reached the 50/50 split, 20% of the remaining incentive fee is payable in shares of our common stock and 80% of the remaining incentive fee is payable in cash. In the fourth quarter of 2018 we recorded an expense of $0.1 million for an incentive fee payable to our Manager. Our dividend payments are driven by our taxable income. If our taxable income continues at the levels we have recently experienced, we could continue to exceed the threshold for paying an incentive fee to our Manager, and thereby trigger such payment. 
We also reimburse the Manager for all third-party, out-of-pocket costs it incurs for managing our business, including third-party diligence and valuation consultants, legal expenses, auditors and other financial services. The reimbursement obligation is not subject to any dollar limitation. Expenses are generally reimbursed in cash on a monthly basis.
We will be required to pay the Manager a termination fee in the event that the Management Agreement is terminated as a result of (i) a termination by us without cause, (ii) our decision not to renew the Management Agreement upon the determination of at least two thirds of our independent directors for reasons including the failure to agree on revised compensation, (iii) a termination by the Manager as a result of us becoming regulated as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act (other than as a result of the acts or omissions of the Manager in violation of investment guidelines approved by our Board of Directors), or (iv) a termination by the Manager if we default in the performance of any material term of the Management Agreement (subject to a notice and cure period). The termination fee will be equal to twice the combined base fee and incentive fees payable to the Manager during the 12-month period ended as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to the date of termination.

On January 25, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the Second Amended and Restated Management Agreement with the Manager which expires on March 5, 2034 and restructures the Management fee into both a quarterly and annual component, changes the calculation of the stock-based portion of the quarterly base management fee, and establishes a procedure by which the Manager may recover costs from the Company incurred in connection with providing services relating to the Company’s entry into any arrangement with third-party unaffiliated entities including joint ventures or other unconsolidated arrangements. See Item 7 — Subsequent events.
The Servicer
Our Servicer, Gregory, was formed by the members of our Manager’s management team to service “high-touch” assets, which are loans that require substantial and active interaction with the borrower for modification or other resolution. These loans are to less creditworthy borrowers or for properties the value of which has decreased and are more expensive to service because they require more frequent interaction with customers and greater monitoring and oversight. Our Servicer, or its wholly-owned subsidiary, is licensed to service loans in all states in which it does business and has unsupervised Title II Mortgagee authorization from the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”). Our Servicer, or its wholly owned subsidiary, is also a licensed mortgage lender in 24 states, and currently has mortgage loan origination staff who are licensed in 10 of those states. We own an 8.0% equity interest in the parent company of our Servicer through a TRS. 
Our Servicer must comply with a wide array of U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that regulate, among other things, the manner in which it services our mortgage loans and manages our real property in accordance with the Servicing Agreement, including recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), mortgage servicing regulations promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). These laws and regulations cover a wide range of topics. The laws and regulations are complex and vary greatly among the states and localities. In addition, these laws and regulations often contain vague standards or requirements, which make compliance efforts challenging. From time to time, the Servicer may become party to certain regulatory inquiries or proceedings, which, even if unrelated to the residential mortgage servicing operation, may result in adverse findings, fines, penalties or other assessments and may affect adversely the Servicer’s reputation.
Servicing fees are 0.65% annually of UPB for loans that are re-performing at acquisition, and 1.25% annually of UPB for loans that are non-performing at acquisition, and are paid monthly. The fees do not change if an RPL becomes non-performing or vice versa. For certain of our joint ventures, the Servicing fee rate for RPLs is reduced to an annual servicing fee rate of 0.42% annually on a loan-by-loan basis for any loan that makes seven consecutive payments. The total fees we incur for these services depend upon the UPB and type of mortgage loans that the Servicer services pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreement. Servicing fees for our real property assets are the greater of (i) the servicing fee applicable to the underlying mortgage loan prior to foreclosure, or (ii) 1.00% annually of the fair market value of the REO as reasonably determined by the Manager or 1.00% annually of the purchase price of any REO we otherwise purchase.
We also reimburse the Servicer for all customary, reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in the performance of its obligations, including the actual cost of any repairs and renovations to REO properties. The total fees we incur for these services will be dependent upon the property value, previous UPB of the relevant loan, and the number of REO properties.
If the Servicing Agreement has been terminated other than for cause and/or the Servicer terminates the Servicing Agreement, we will be required to pay a termination fee equal to the aggregate servicing fees payable under the Servicing Agreement for the immediate preceding 12-month period.
Our Servicer services our mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), REO and other real estate assets. Our Servicer is licensed to service loans or is exempt from licensing in all states in which it does business. Our Servicer is also an approved servicer for the FHA and the Veterans Administration (“VA”). As of the date of this annual report, our Servicer and its subsidiary is licensed in every state in which licensing is required for such activities.
Our Servicer employs various loan resolution methodologies with respect to our residential mortgage loans, including loan modification, collateral resolution and collateral disposition. To help us achieve our business objective, the Servicer focuses on (1) supporting the continuing performance of our RPLs; (2) converting a portion of our RPLs and NPLs to performing status; and (3) managing the foreclosure process and timelines with respect to the remainder of those loans.
Our preferred resolution methodology is typically to cause the RPLs and NPLs to perform. Following a period of continued performance, we expect many borrowers will refinance these loans with other lenders at or near the estimated value of the underlying property, potentially generating attractive returns for us. We believe loan re-performance followed by refinancing generates near-term cash flows, provides the highest possible stable economic outcome for us and is a socially responsible business strategy because it keeps more families in their homes. In certain circumstances, we may also consider selling these new RPLs. However, based on historical experience, we expect that many of our residential NPLs will enter into foreclosure, ultimately becoming REO that we can, partially based on our analysis of risk-adjusted returns, sell, or convert into 
9

rental properties. If a REO property does not meet our investment criteria, we expect the Servicer to engage in REO liquidation and short sale processes to dispose of the property and generate cash for reinvestment in other acquisitions. We believe that our multifaceted resolution approach generally creates optimal stable returns, as all loans and REO may not be amenable to a single resolution strategy. To avoid the 100% prohibited transaction tax on the sale of dealer property by a REIT, we may dispose of assets that may be treated as held “primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business” by contributing or selling the assets to a TRS, prior to marketing the asset for sale. For more information regarding our resolution methodologies, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Factors That May Affect Our Operating Results — Resolution Methodologies.”
The Servicer collects and remits mortgage loan payments, responds to borrower inquiries, accounts for principal and interest, holds custodial and escrow funds for payment of property taxes and insurance premiums, counsels or otherwise works with delinquent borrowers, supervises foreclosures and property dispositions and generally administers the loans. In return for these servicing functions, we pay servicing fees to the Servicer equal to specified percentages of the outstanding unpaid principal balance of the loans being serviced. We are entitled to other forms of servicing compensation, rather than the Servicer, such as late payment or modification fees and any prepayment penalties payable by borrowers. Servicing compensation also includes interest income, or the “float,” earned on collections that are deposited in various custodial accounts between their receipt and the scheduled or contractual distribution of the funds to investors. Generally, the Servicer does not advance delinquent monthly payments of interest or principal in respect of mortgage loans but will be obligated to make certain servicing advances.
The Servicer also services the mortgage loans underlying the MBS we create and sell to investors pursuant to customary agreements.
Under the Servicing Agreement, the Servicer also provides property management, lease management and renovation management services associated with the real properties we acquire upon conversion of mortgage loans that we own or that we acquire directly and assists in finding third party financing for such properties.
When we determine to sell a particular REO asset through our Servicer, we have the capability in certain states to underwrite and offer mortgage financing to the purchaser. We rely on our Servicer’s in-depth knowledge of the properties when we facilitate financing in connection with a sale of a property through an unaffiliated lender. Unlike more traditional lenders, which base their underwriting primarily on the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO®) credit risk score, our Servicer focuses on the borrower’s cash flow and residual income after satisfaction of monthly requirements, including the expenses for any dependents, employment stability and the ability to make a cash down payment. As a result, when selling REO property, we may choose to purchase the loan. We believe that our ability to offer financing tailored to the particular borrower provides another tool to maximize our return by converting REO to long-term significant net yield generating assets. Our Servicer receives no additional compensation from us for originating REO sale financing or other loans that we acquire.
Competition
In acquiring our assets, we compete with other mortgage and hybrid REITs, hedge funds, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, investment banking firms, financial institutions, governmental bodies and other entities. Most of our competitors are significantly larger than us, have greater access to capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us. In addition to existing companies, other companies may be organized for similar purposes, including companies focused on purchasing mortgage assets. A proliferation of such companies may increase the competition for equity capital and thereby adversely affect the price of our shares of common stock. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of assets and establish more relationships than us.
In the face of this competition, we rely on our Manager’s professionals and their industry expertise, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage and helps us assess risks and determine appropriate pricing for certain potential assets. In addition, we believe that these relationships enable us to compete more effectively for attractive asset acquisition opportunities. However, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives due to the competitive risks that we face.
Operating and Regulatory Structure
Tax Requirements
We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. Provided that we continue to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that they currently distribute at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income excluding net capital gains. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to comply with 
10

such requirements in the future. Failure to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year would cause us to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates (and any applicable state and local taxes). Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. taxes on our income. For example, for any business that we conduct through a TRS, the income generated by that subsidiary will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. GAJX Real Estate LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership formed to own, maintain, improve and sell certain REO purchased by us. GA-TRS LLC (“GA-TRS”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Operating Partnership that owns our 19.8% equity interest in our Manager and our 8.0% interest in the parent of our Servicer. We have elected to treat both GAJX Real Estate LLC and GA-TRS as taxable REIT subsidiaries under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
Investment Company Act Exclusion
We conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test. Excluded from the term ‘‘investment securities,’’ among other things, are securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.
We are organized as a holding company and conduct our businesses primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership. Our Operating Partnership holds certain real estate and real estate-related assets, directly and through subsidiaries. Neither we nor our Operating Partnership nor Great Ajax Funding is an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C). In addition, we conduct our operations so that neither we nor our Operating Partnership nor Great Ajax Funding come within the definition of an investment company by ensuring that less than 40% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis consists of “investment securities.”
We monitor our compliance with the 40% test and the holdings of our subsidiaries to ensure that each of our subsidiaries is in compliance with an applicable exemption or exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
Our 19.8% equity interest in our Manager and our 8.0% equity interest in the parent company of our Servicer are owned by GA-TRS, which is a special purpose subsidiary of our Operating Partnership. GA-TRS may rely on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) for its Investment Company Act exclusion and, therefore, our interest in such subsidiary would constitute an ‘‘investment security’’ for purposes of determining whether we pass the 40% test. We also may form certain other wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that will invest, subject to our investment guidelines, in other real estate-related assets. These subsidiaries may rely upon the exclusion from the definition of investment company under the Investment Company Act pursuant to Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. The securities issued by any wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiary that we may form and that are excluded from the definition of “investment company” based on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis.
In addition, we believe that neither we nor certain of our subsidiaries will be considered investment companies under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because we and they will not engage primarily or hold themselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, we and such subsidiaries will be primarily engaged in non-investment company businesses related to real estate. Consequently, we and our subsidiaries expect to be able to conduct our operations such that none will be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
Certain of our subsidiaries may also rely upon certain exclusions from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, requires an entity to invest at least 55% of its assets in “mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate,” which we refer to as “qualifying real estate interests,” and at least 80% of its assets in qualifying real estate interests plus “real estate-related assets.”
On August 31, 2011, the SEC published a concept release entitled “Companies Engaged in the Business of Acquiring Mortgages and Mortgage Related Instruments” (Investment Company Act Rel. No. 29778). This release notes that the SEC is reviewing the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion relied upon by companies similar to us that invest in mortgage loans. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of companies similar to ours, or the guidance from the SEC or its staff regarding the treatment of assets as qualifying real estate assets or real estate-related assets, 
11

will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations as a result of this review. To the extent that the SEC or its staff provides more specific guidance regarding any of the matters bearing upon our exclusion from the need to register under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue the strategies that we have chosen.
The loss of our exemption from regulation pursuant to the Investment Company Act could require us to restructure our operations, sell certain of our assets or abstain from the purchase of certain assets, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure — Maintenance of our exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act imposes significant limitations on our operations.”
Commodity Pool Operator Exemption
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, any investment fund that trades in swaps may be considered a “commodity pool,” which would cause its operators to be regulated as a “commodity pool operator,” or ("CPO"). We have relied on no-action relief from registration from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and filed our claim with the CFTC to perfect the use of the no-action relief from registration. In order to be exempt from registration as a CPO under the no-action relief, we must, among other non-operation requirements: (1) limit our initial margin and premiums required to establish our swap or futures positions to no more than 5% of the fair market value of our total assets; and (2) limit our net income derived annually from our swaps and futures positions that are not “qualifying hedging transactions” to less than 5% of our gross income. The need to operate within these parameters could limit the use of swaps by us below the level that we would otherwise consider optimal or may lead to the registration of our company or our directors as CPOs. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Regulatory and Legislative Actions — We may be unable to operate within the parameters that allow us to be excluded from regulation as a commodity pool operator, which would subject us to additional regulation and compliance requirements, and could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.”
​Environmental Matters
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance with environmental laws at our properties. Environmental laws can impose liability on an owner or operator of real property for the investigation and remediation of contamination at or migrating from such real property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of the contaminants. The costs of any required investigation or cleanup of these substances could be substantial. The liability is generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the property’s value and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties also may expose us to third-party liability for personal injury or property damage or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or renovate the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Employees
Exclusive of certain incentive stock grants, we do not currently have any employees who are paid directly by us, and, excluding incentive stock grants do not expect to have any employees paid directly by us in the foreseeable future. Each of our executive officers is an employee or officer or both, of our Manager or of the Servicer, and they are paid by our Manager or the Servicer, as applicable. Our Manager and the Servicer share employees with other affiliates of Aspen as necessary to implement our business strategy.
