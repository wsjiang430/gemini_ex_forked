Background
 
Namliong SkyCosmos, Inc. (“we” or the “Company”) was incorporated on February 7, 2005, under the name Gemwood Productions, for the purpose of marketing and selling day spa services to tourists at resort destinations throughout Mexico. On November 2, 2006, we changed our name to Kreido Biofuels, Inc. in connection with the acquisition of Kreido Laboratories, Inc., a California corporation (“Kreido Labs”), and the disposition of the Gemwood Leasco, Inc. subsidiary, through which entity the tourist business had been carried out. Kreido Labs was founded to develop proprietary technology for building micro-composite materials for electronic applications, and developed technology to improve the speed, completeness and efficiency of certain chemical reactions, including esterifications and transesterifications, in the pharmaceutical and special chemical industries. In the first quarter of 2006, Kreido Labs elected to focus exclusively on the biodiesel industry. This business was not successful, and we sold the technology and related assets to an unrelated party on March 5, 2009. After that disposition, we sought unsuccessfully for another acquisition until the present time. In November of 2019, the Company discontinued operations of its subsidiary, Kreido Labs. On April 19, 2022, the Company changed its name to Namliong SkyCosmos, Inc.

The sale of the Control Shares consummated on June 29, 2018. In connection with the sale of the Control Shares, G. Reed Petersen resigned from his positions as the sole executive officer and director of the Company, effective June 29, 2018. Mr. Petersen’s departure was not due to any dispute or disagreement with the Company on any matter related to the Company’s operations, policies or practices.

Business Focus
 
Our current business is to seek to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Our acquisition strategy is to assess a broad range of potential business combination targets and complete a business combination. In doing so, we will evaluate the historical financial statements of the target, its management, and projected future results. In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.
 
We are in active discussions with affiliates of our directors, officers and or significant shareholders to effect a business combination but have not yet executed any definitive agreements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully effect a business combination with such affiliates. 
 
We intend to effectuate our business combination using only our capital stock, debt or a combination of stock and debt. The issuance of additional shares of our stock in a business combination:
 

· | may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock; 
· | could cause a change of control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;
· | may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and 
· | may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.

Similarly, if we issue debt securities, it could result in:
 

· | default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;
· | our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 
· | our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; 
· | our inability to pay dividends on our common stock; 
· | using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 
· | limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 
· | increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and 
· | limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

 
As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, as at December 31, 2022, we had $0 in cash. Further, we expect to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans, which could be funded by advances from management. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our business combination will be successful.
