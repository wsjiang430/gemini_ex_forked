Item 1. Business
Overview of the Company
Priority is a leading payments technology company that leverages a purpose-built platform to enable clients to collect, store and send money, operating at scale. We help our customers take and make payments while managing business and consumer operating accounts to monetize payment networks. Our tailored, agile technology powers high-value payments products bolstered by our industry leading personalized support.
Priority was established in 2005 and has grown from a founder-financed startup to become the 5th largest non-bank merchant acquirer in the U.S. by volume. Since inception, we have built a native technology platform that provides all forms of payments (card acquiring and issuing, ACH, check and wire) and embedded finance services that serve SMB, ISV and enterprise customers. Collectively, our single platform to collect, store and send money currently processes approximately $113 billion in payment volume on behalf of its approximately 260,000 SMB and ISV customers and has established approximately 75,000 supplier relationships. Priority maintains a global business platform with 870 employees operating from its headquarters in Alpharetta, GA and offices in other locations, including New York, NY; Hicksville, NY; Chattanooga, TN; Raleigh, NC; Houston, TX; and Chandigarh, India.
Priority delivers value to its partners by leveraging its payments and embedded finance technology to deliver solutions that power modern commerce for SMBs and enterprise software and business partners. Our approach is simple, we handle the complexities of payments and embedded finance to free our partners to focus on their core business objectives. Priority's solutions are offered via API or proprietary applications with nationwide money transmission licenses, providing end-to-end operational support including automated risk management and underwriting, full compliance and industry leading customer service.
Our growth has been underpinned by three key strengths: 1) market leading proprietary product platforms in SMB, B2B and Enterprise Payments verticals; 2) focused distribution engines dedicated to helping our partners monetize their merchant payment networks; and 3) a cost-efficient, agile payment and business processing infrastructure, purpose-built to support our partners in operating in these distinct market verticals.
Priority's solutions are delivered via internally developed payment applications and services to customers in the following business segments:
•SMB Payments: Provides full-service acquiring and payment-enabled solutions for B2C transactions, leveraging Priority's proprietary software platform, distributed through ISO, direct sales and vertically focused ISV channels.
•B2B Payments: Provides market-leading AP automation solutions to corporations, software partners and industry leading FIs (including Citibank and Mastercard).
•Enterprise Payments: Provides embedded payment and treasury solutions to enterprise customers to modernize legacy platforms and accelerate software partners' strategies to monetize payments.

The MX product line provides technology-enabled payment acceptance and business management capabilities to merchants, enterprises and our distribution partners. The MX product line includes MX Connect and MX Merchant products, which together provide resellers and merchant clients a flexible and customizable set of business applications that help better manage critical business work functions and revenue performance using core payment processing as our leverage point. MX Connect provides our SMB payments reselling partners with automated tools that support low friction merchant on-boarding, underwriting and risk management, client service, and commission processing through a single mobile-enabled, web-based interface. The result is a smooth merchant activation onto our flagship consumer payments offering, MX Merchant, which provides core processing and business solutions to SMB clients. In addition to payment processing, the MX Merchant product line encompasses a variety of proprietary and third-party product applications that merchants can adopt such as MX Insights, MX Storefront, MX Retail, MX Invoice, MX B2B and ACH.com, among others. This comprehensive suite of solutions enables merchants to 1) identify key consumer trends in their businesses; 2) quickly implement e-commerce or retail POS solutions; and 3) handle ACH payments. By empowering resellers to adopt a consultative selling approach and embedding our technology into the critical day-to-day workflows and operations of both merchants and resellers, we believe that we have established and maintained "sticky" relationships. We believe that our strong retention, coupled with consistent merchant onboarding, have resulted in strong processing volume and revenue growth. 
In addition to our SMB offering, we have diversified our source of revenues through our growing presence in the B2B market. We provide automated AP offerings to our enterprise clients and financial institutions through our CPX platform. Our CPX platform offers clients a seamless bridge for buyer-to-supplier (payor-to-provider) payments by integrating directly to a buyer's payment instruction file and parsing it for payment to suppliers via virtual card, purchase card, ACH +, dynamic discounting or check. Successful implementation of our AP automation solutions provides: 1) suppliers with the benefits of cash acceleration; 2) buyers with valuable rebate/discount revenue: and 3) the Company with stable sources of payment processing and other revenue. Additionally, we provide curated managed services and a robust suite of integrated AP automation solutions to industry leading FIs and card networks such as Citibank, Mastercard and Visa, among others. Considering that the commercial payments volume in the U.S. is over twice the size of consumer payments and substantially less penetrated for Electronic Payments, we believe that this market represents a high growth opportunity for us. 
Our Enterprise Payments segment provides embedded payment and treasury solutions to enterprise customers that modernize legacy platforms and accelerate modern software partners looking to monetize payment components. We provide solutions for 
 6 


ISVs, third-party integrators, and merchants that allow for the leveraging of our core payments engine, our automated payables platform or our account ledgering capabilities all via API resources.
We generate revenue primarily from payment processing transactions, and to a lesser extent, from monthly subscription services and other solutions provided to customers. Payment processing fees are generated from the ongoing sales of our merchants and are governed by multi-year merchant contracts. As a result, payment processing fees are highly recurring in nature. Due to the nature of our strong reseller-centric distribution model and differentiated technology offering, we can drive efficient scale and operating leverage, generating robust margins and profitability. 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenue of $663.6 million, net loss attributable to common stockholders of $39.0 million and operating income of $56.2 million, compared to revenue of $514.9 million, net loss attributable to common stockholders of $24.6 million and operating income of $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Industry Overview
The payment processing industry provides merchants with credit, debit, gift, loyalty card and other payment processing services, along with related value-added solutions and information services. The industry continues to grow, driven by wider merchant acceptance, increased use of Electronic Payments and advances in payment technology. The proliferation of bankcards and the use of other payment technologies has made the acceptance of Electronic Payments through multiple channels a virtual necessity for many businesses to remain competitive. The increased use and acceptance of bankcards and the availability of more sophisticated products and services has resulted in a highly competitive, specialized industry. 
Services to the SMB merchant market have been historically characterized by basic payment processing without ready access to more sophisticated technology, value-added solutions, or customer service that are typically offered to large merchants. To keep up with the changing demands of how consumers wish to pay for goods and services, we believe that SMB merchants increasingly recognize the need for value-added services wrapped around omni-channel payment solutions that are tailored to their specific business needs. 
Key Industry Trends
The following are key trends we believe are impacting the merchant acquiring/payment processing industry: 
•Trend Toward Electronic Transactions – We believe the continued shift from cash/paper payments toward electronic/card payments will drive growth for merchant acquirers and processors as volume continues to grow correspondingly. We believe this migration and overall market growth will continue to provide tailwinds to the Electronic Payments industry.
•Convergence of Payments and Embedded Finance Solutions – As consumer behavior shifted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the scale of disruption grew dramatically and we believe the speed of change will continue to rise. The appetite of both merchants and consumers for new alternatives to traditional payment options remains top of mind and big tech companies, fintechs, challenger banks and other non-bank entrants are driving market disruption by offering customers better user experiences at lower prices. The continued displacement of cash and checks over the next several years, helped along by customers' adoption of digital shopping and fueled by their desire to avoid contact with physical infrastructure and objects, continues to create even more opportunities for disruption in payments.
•Mobile Payments – Historically, e-commerce was conducted on a computer via a web browser; however, as mobile technologies continue to proliferate, consumers are making more purchases through mobile browsers and native mobile applications. We believe this shift represents a significant opportunity given the high growth rates of mobile payments volume, higher fees for card-not-present and cross-border processing and potential for the in-app economy to stimulate and/or alter consumer spending behavior.
B2B payments is the largest payment market in the U.S. by volume and presents a significant opportunity for payment providers to capitalize on the conversion of check and paper-based payments to Electronic Payments, including card-based 
 7 


acceptance. As businesses have increasingly looked to improve efficiency and reduce costs, the electronification of B2B payments has gained momentum.
Competitive Strengths
We possess certain attributes that we believe differentiate us as a leading provider of merchant acquiring, commercial payment and embedded finance solutions in the U.S. Our key competitive strengths include: 
•Diverse Reseller Community – We maintain strong reseller relationships with approximately 1,300 partners, including ISOs, FIs, ISVs, VARs and other referral partners. MX Connect enables resellers to efficiently market merchant acquiring solutions to a broad base of merchants through a one-to-many distribution model. We believe that our ability to service our reseller partners through a comprehensive offering provides a competitive advantage that has allowed the Company to build a large, diverse merchant base characterized by high retention. The strengths of our technology offering are manifested in the fact that we maintain ownership of merchant contracts, with most reseller contracts including strong non-solicit and portability restrictions. 
•Comprehensive Suite of Payment Solutions – We offer a comprehensive and differentiated suite of traditional and emerging payment products and services that enables SMBs to address their payment needs through one provider. Our purpose-built proprietary technology provides technology-enabled payment acceptance and business management solutions to merchants, enterprises and ISVs. We provide a payment processing platform that allows merchants to accept Electronic Payments (e.g., credit cards, debit cards, and ACH) at the POS, online, and via mobile payment technologies. We deliver innovative business management products and add-on features that meet the needs of SMBs across different vertical markets. Additionally, with our embedded finance offerings, we are uniquely positioned to collect, store and send money on behalf of our customers. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the trend towards integrated payments solutions, new technology adoption and value-add service utilization that is underway in the SMB market. We believe our solutions facilitate a superior merchant experience that results in increased customer lifetime value. 
•Highly Scalable Business Model with Operating Leverage – As a result of thoughtful investments in our technology, we have developed robust and differentiated infrastructure that has enabled us to scale in a cost-efficient manner. Our operating efficiency supports a low capital expenditure environment to develop product enhancements that drive organic growth across our SMB, B2B and Enterprise payment ecosystems, as well as, attract both reselling partners and enterprise clients looking for best-in-class solutions. By creating a cost-efficient environment that facilitates the combination of ongoing product innovation to drive organic growth and stable cash flow to fund acquisitions, we anticipate ongoing economies of scale and increased margins over time. 
•Experienced Management Team Led by Industry Veterans – Our executive management team has a record of execution in the merchant acquiring and technology-enabled payments industry. Our team has continued to develop and enhance our proprietary and innovative technology platforms that differentiate us in the payments industry. We invest to attract and retain executive leadership that align with the opportunities in the market and our strategic focus. 
Growth Strategies
We intend to continue to execute a multi-pronged growth strategy, with diverse organic initiatives supplemented by acquisitions. Growth strategies include: 
Organic Growth in our Reseller and Merchant Base
We expect to grow through our existing reseller network and merchant base by capitalizing on the organic growth of existing merchant volume and reseller merchant portfolios. By providing resellers with agile tools to manage their sales businesses and grow their merchant portfolio, we have established a solid base from which to generate new merchant adoption and retain existing merchants. By engaging in a consultative partnership approach, we maintain strong relationships with our reseller partners and continue to exhibit strong merchant adoption and volume growth trends. Through our resellers, we provide 
 8 


merchants with full-service acquiring solutions, as well as value-added services and tools to streamline their business processes and enable them to focus on driving same store sales growth. 
Deploy our Embedded Finance Solution to Enterprise Customers
Our Enterprise Payments segment, and its flagship product Priority Passport enables software partners and business platform customers to embed our payments and treasury solutions into their core operating and business systems that deliver a fully automated and digital experience to collect, store and send money for their customers. Through Passport, Priority delivers a fully embedded finance solution to customers that manages the inflows and outflows, and reconciliation, of all forms of payments (ACH, wire, check, credit and debit) for an infinite number of clients from a single account. The platform today manages over 460,000 active accounts and, through its money transmission licenses in 46 U.S. states and two U.S. territories, handles over $500 million in deposits across a growing number of banking partners. This segment is quickly growing as marketplaces, gig economy platforms, software partners, and legacy business platforms are incorporating features of payment processing and embedded finance services into their customer experience and enhance their offering.
Expand our Network of Distribution Partners
We have established and maintained a strong position within the reseller community with approximately 1,300 partners. We intend to continue to expand our distribution network to reach new partners, particularly with ISVs and VARs to expand technology and integrated partnerships. We believe that our technology offering enables us to attract and retain, high-quality resellers focused on growth. 
Deploy Industry Specific Payment Technology
We intend to continue to enhance and deploy our technology-enabled payment solutions and our capabilities to collect, store and send money into industry-specific verticals. We continue to identify and evaluate new, attractive industries where we can deliver differentiated technology-enabled payment solutions that meet merchants' industry-specific needs. 
Expand Electronic Payments Share of B2B Transactions with CPX
We have a growing presence in the commercial payments market where we provide curated managed services and AP automation solutions to industry leading FIs and card networks such as Citibank, Mastercard and Visa. The commercial payments market is the largest and one of the fastest growing payments markets in the U.S. by volume. We are well positioned to capitalize on the shift from check to Electronic Payments, which currently lags the consumer payments market, by eliminating the friction between buyers and suppliers through our industry leading offerings. We believe this will drive strong growth and profitability. 
Accretive Acquisitions
With a consistent, long-term goal of maximizing stockholder value, we intend to selectively pursue strategic and tactical acquisitions that meet our established criteria. We actively seek potential acquisition candidates that exhibit certain attractive attributes including predictable and recurring revenue, a scalable operating model, low capital intensity complementary technology offerings and a strong cultural fit. Our operating infrastructure is purpose-built to rapidly and seamlessly consolidate complementary businesses into our ecosystem all while optimizing revenue and cost synergies. 
Sales and Distribution
We reach our SMB segment through three primary sales channels: 1) ISOs (Retail and Wholesale) and Agents; 2) FIs; and 3) ISVs and VARs. Our cloud-based solution, MX Connect, allows our partners and resellers to engage merchants for processing services and a host of value-added features designed to enhance their customer relationships. Our merchants utilize our cloud-based MX Merchant product suite to manage their businesses and process transactions. This separate solution increases our ability to retain the merchant if the ISO were to leave the Company. 
 9 


Our B2B segment obtains its partner clients through: 1) direct sales initiatives; 2) ISVs and business partnerships; 3) the card networks (Mastercard and Visa); and 4) large U.S. banking institutions. We support a direct vendor sales model that provides turn-key merchant development, product sales and supplier enablement programs. By establishing a seamless bridge for buyer-to-supplier (payor-to-provider) payments that is integrated directly to a buyer's payment instruction file to facilitate payments to vendors via all payment types (virtual card, purchase card, ACH +, dynamic discounting), we have established ourselves as one of the top solutions in commercial payments.
Our Enterprise segment goes to market through integrations with software partners and business platform customers by enabling them to embed our payments and treasury solutions into their core operating and business systems. Priority’s Passport offering provides those partners with a fully automated, scalable and integrated financial tool to collect, store and send money for their customers.
Our market strategy has resulted in a merchant base that we believe is diversified across both industries and geographies resulting in, what we believe, is more stable average profitability per merchant. Only one single reseller relationship contributes more than 10% of total bankcard processing volume, and that one relationship represents approximately 18% of our total bankcard processing volume.
Security, Disaster Recovery and Back-up Systems
As a result of routine business operations, we store information relating to our merchants and their transactions. Because this information is considered sensitive in nature, we maintain a high level of security to protect it. Our computational systems are continually updated and audited to the latest security standards as defined by 1) payment card industry and data security standards; and 2) the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. As such, we have a dedicated team responsible for responding to security incidents. This team develops, maintains, tests and verifies our incident response plan. The primary function of this team is to react and respond to intrusions, denial of service, data leakage, malware, vandalism and other events that could potentially jeopardize data availability, integrity and confidentiality. In addition to handling security incidents, the incident response team continually educates themselves and us on information security matters. 
High-availability and disaster recovery are provided through a combination of redundant hardware and software running at two geographically distinct data centers. Each data center deployment is an exact mirror of the other and each can handle all technical, payment and business operations for all product lines independently. If one data center becomes impaired, the traffic is automatically redirected to the other. Business continuity planning drills are run each quarter to test fail-over and recovery as well as staff operations and readiness.
Third-party Processors and Sponsor Banks
We partner with various vendors in the payments value chain, most notably processors and sponsor banks which sit between us (the merchant acquirer) and the card networks, to assist us in providing payment processing services to merchant clients. Processing is a scale-driven business in which many acquirers outsource the processing function to a small number of large processors. In these partnerships, we serve as a merchant acquirer and enter into processing agreements with payment processors, such as First Data or Global Payments, to assist us in providing front-end and back-end transaction processing services for our merchants. These third parties are compensated for their services. These processors in turn have agreements with card networks such as Visa and Mastercard, through which the transaction information is routed in exchange for network fees. 
To provide processing services, merchant acquirers like Priority must be registered with the card networks (e.g., Visa and Mastercard). To register with a card network in the U.S., acquirers must maintain relationships with banks willing to sponsor the merchant acquirer's adherence to the rules and standards of the card networks, or a sponsor bank. We maintain sponsor bank relationships with Wells Fargo, Synovus Bank, Pueblo Bank, Sutton Bank, Fifth Third Bank and Axiom Bank. For ACH payments, the Company's ACH network (ACH.com) is sponsored by South State Bank and Fifth Third Bank. Sponsor bank relationships enable us to route transactions under the sponsor bank's control and identification number (referred to as a BIN for Visa and ICA for Mastercard) across the card networks (or ACH network) to authorize and clear transactions.

Risk Management
Our thoughtful merchant and reseller underwriting policies combined with our forward-looking transaction monitoring capabilities have enabled us to maintain low credit loss performance. Our risk management strategies are informed by a team with decades of experience managing merchant acquiring risk operations that are augmented by our rules-based modern systems designed to manage risk at the transaction level. 
Initial Underwriting – Central to our risk management process are our front-line underwriting policies that vet all resellers and merchants prior to their contractual arrangements with us. Our automated risk systems pull: 1) credit bureau reports; 2) corporate ownership details; 3) anti-money laundering information; and, 4) OFAC and FinCEN information from a variety of integrated databases. The collected information is delivered to a tenured team of underwriters who conduct any necessary industry checks, financial performance analysis or owner background checks, consistent with our policies. Based upon these results, the underwriting department rejects or approves the merchant or reseller and sets appropriate merchant and reseller reserve requirements which are held by our bank sponsors on our behalf. Resellers are subject to quarterly and/or annual assessments for financial strength in compliance with our policies and adjustments to reserve levels. The results of our initial merchant underwriting process inform the transaction-level risk limits for volume, average ticket, transaction types and authorization codes that are captured by our CYRIS risk module - a proprietary risk system that monitors and reports transaction risk activity to our risk team. This transaction-level risk module, housed within MX Connect, forms the foundational risk management framework that enables the Company to optimize transaction activity and processing scale while preserving a modest aggregate risk profile that has resulted in historically low losses.
Real-Time Risk Monitoring – Merchant transactions are monitored on a transactional basis to proactively enforce risk controls. Our risk systems provide automated evaluation of merchant transaction activity against initial underwriting settings. Transactions that are outside underwriting parameters are queued for further investigation. Also, resellers whose merchant portfolio represents a concentration of investigated merchants are evaluated for risk action (i.e., increased reserves or contract termination). 
Risk Audit – Transactions flagged by our risk monitoring systems or that demonstrate suspicious activity traits that have been flagged for review can result in funds being held in addition to other risk mitigation actions. The risk mitigation actions can include: 1) non-authorization of the transaction; 2) debit of reserves; or 3) termination of the processing agreement. Merchants are periodically reviewed to assess any risk adjustments based upon their overall financial health and compliance with network standards. Merchant transaction activity is investigated for instances of business activity changes or credit impairment (and improvement). 
Loss Mitigation – In instances where transactions and/or individual merchants are flagged for fraud, or in instances where the transaction activity is resulting in excessive charge-backs, several loss mitigation actions may be taken. These include: 1) charge-back dispute resolution; 2) merchant and reseller funds (reserves or processed batches) withheld; 3) inclusion on Network Match List to notify the industry of a "bad actor"; and/or 4) legal action. 
Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses
On November 18, 2022, the Company completed our acquisition of certain assets of Ovvi, LLC. Ovvi, LLC operated as a SaaS proprietary platform for the restaurant, hospitality and retail industries. The acquisition will allow the Company to offer point of sale software and hardware systems, comprehensive ancillary services and processing services. 
On September 17, 2021, The Company completed our acquisition of Finxera. Finxera is a provider of deposit account management and licensed money transmission services in the U.S. The acquisition of Finxera allows the Company to offer clients turn-key merchant services, payment facilitation, card issuing, automated payables, virtual banking, e-wallet tools, risk management, underwriting and compliance on a single platform. 
See Note 2. Acquisitions for additional information related to the Company's acquisitions. For information regarding our business disposal, see Note 3. Disposal of Business.

Competition
The U.S. acquiring industry is highly competitive, with several large processors accounting for the majority of processing volume. When excluding banks, we ranked 5th among U.S. non-bank merchant acquirers, according to the Nilson Report issued in March 2022. 
The concentration at the top of the industry is partly a result of consolidation. We believe that consolidation has also resulted in many large processors maintaining multiple, inflexible legacy IT systems that are not well-equipped to adjust to changing market requirements. We believe that the large merchant acquirers whose innovation has been hindered by these redundant, legacy systems risk losing market share to acquirers with more agile and dynamic IT systems, such as Priority.
Pricing has historically been the key factor influencing the selection of a merchant acquirer. Providers with more advanced tech-enabled services (primarily online and integrated offerings), have an advantage over providers who are operating legacy technology and offering undifferentiated services that have come under pricing pressure from higher levels of competition. High quality customer service further differentiates providers as this helps to reduce attrition. Other competitive factors that set acquirers apart include: 1) price; 2) breadth of product offerings; 3) partnerships with FIs; 4) servicing capability; 5) data security; and 6) functionality. Leading acquirers are expected to continue to add additional services to expand cross-selling opportunities, primarily in omni-channel payment solutions, POS software, payments security, customer loyalty and other payments-related offerings. 
The largest opportunity for acquirers to expand is within the SMB merchant market. According to the SMB Group, a markets insight firm for SMBs, the majority of SMBs recognize the upside that tech-enabled solutions provide to daily operations and long-term growth potential. As small businesses increasingly demand integrated solutions tailored to specific business functions or industries, merchant processors are adopting payment-enabled software offerings that combine embedded finance products with core business operating software. By subsisting within SMB's critical business software, processors are able to improve economic results through better merchant retention and higher processing margins. Through our MX Merchant platform, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the trend towards integrated solutions, new technology adoption and value added-service utilization in the SMB market.
Government Regulation and Payment Network Rules
We operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations and the rules and standards of the payment networks that are utilized to provide our electronic payment services, as more fully described below. 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
The Dodd-Frank Act resulted in significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate the debit interchange transaction fees that a card issuer or payment card network receives or charges for an electronic debit transaction. Pursuant to the so-called "Durbin Amendment" to the Dodd-Frank Act, these fees must be "reasonable and proportional" to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, debit interchange rates for card issuers with assets of $10.0 billion or more are capped at $0.21 per transaction and an ad valorem component of five basis points to reflect a portion of the issuer's fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuers, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs. The cap on interchange fees has not had a material direct effect on our results of operations. 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act limits the ability of payment card networks to impose certain restrictions because it allows merchants to: 1) set minimum dollar amounts (not to exceed $10.00) for the acceptance of a credit card (and allows federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education to set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards); and 2) provide discounts or incentives to encourage consumers to pay with cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards. 
The rules also contain prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions. These rules require a card issuer to: 1) enable at least two unaffiliated networks on each debit card; 2) prohibit card networks from entering into exclusivity 
 12 


arrangements; and 3) restrict the ability of issuers or networks to mandate transaction routing requirements. The prohibition on network exclusivity has not significantly affected our ability to pass on network fees and other costs to our customers, nor do we expect it to in the future. 
The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which has assumed responsibility for enforcing federal consumer protection laws, and the FSOC, which was established to, among other things, identify risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system. The FSOC has the authority to require supervision and regulation of nonbank financial companies that the FSOC determines pose a systemic risk to the U.S. financial system. Accordingly, we may be subject to additional systemic risk-related oversight.
Payment Network Rules and Standards
As a merchant acquirer, we are subject to the rules of Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover and other payment networks. In order to provide services, several of our subsidiaries are either registered as service providers for member institutions with Mastercard, Visa and other networks or are direct members of Mastercard, Visa and other networks. Accordingly, we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card networks for certain acts or omissions. 
Banking Laws and Regulations
The FFIEC is an interagency body comprised of federal bank and credit union regulators such as the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. The FFIEC examines large data processors to identify and mitigate risks associated with systemically significant service providers, including specifically the risks they may pose to the banking industry.
We are considered by the FFIEC to be a TSP based on the services we provide to FIs. As a TSP, we are subject to audits by an interagency group consisting of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
We also hold money transmission licenses in 46 U.S. states and two U.S. territories. Accordingly, we are subject to the applicable laws and regulations and are subject to examinations by state banking regulators.
Privacy and Information Security Laws
We provide services that may be subject to various state, federal and foreign privacy laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include: 1) the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which applies to a broad range of FIs and to companies that provide services to FIs in the U.S.; 2) certain health care technology laws, including HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Act; and 3) the CCPA, which establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by: i) creating an expanded definition of personal information; ii) establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California; iii) imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors; and iv) creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. We are also subject to a variety of foreign data protection and privacy laws, including, without limitation, Directive 95/46/EC, as implemented in each member state of the European Union and its successor, the General Data Protection Regulation. Among other things, these foreign and domestic laws, and their implementing regulations, in certain cases: 1) restrict the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information; 2) require notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use; and 3) disclosure of protected information. These laws also impose requirements for safeguarding and removal or elimination of personal information. 
AML and Counter-terrorism Regulation
The U.S. federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the BSA, and the BSA implementing regulations administered by FinCEN, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, require, among other things, each financial institution to: 1) develop and implement a risk-based anti-money laundering program; 2) file reports on large currency transactions; 3) file suspicious activity reports if the financial institution believes a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations; and 4) maintain transaction records. Given that a number of our clients are FIs that are directly subject to U.S. 
 13 


federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, we have developed an anti-money laundering compliance program to best assist our clients in meeting such legal and regulatory requirements. 
We are subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by OFAC of the U.S. Department of Treasury, which place prohibitions and restrictions on all U.S. citizens and entities with respect to transactions by U.S. persons with specified countries and individuals and entities identified on OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals list (for example, individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, countries subject to certain economic and trade sanctions, as well as terrorists, terrorist organizations and narcotics traffickers identified by OFAC under programs that are not country specific). Similar anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified on lists maintained by organizations similar to OFAC in several other countries and which may impose specific data retention obligations or prohibitions on intermediaries in the payment process. We have developed and continue to enhance compliance programs and policies to monitor and address such legal and regulatory requirements and developments. We continue to enhance such programs and policies to ensure that our customers do not engage in prohibited transactions with designated countries, individuals or entities. 
Telephone Consumer Protection Act
We are subject to the Federal TCPA and various state laws to the extent we place telephone calls and SMS messages to clients and consumers. The TCPA regulates certain telephone calls and SMS messages placed using automatic telephone dialing systems or artificial or prerecorded voices and can alter the way we do business. 
Escheat Laws
We are subject to U.S. federal and state unclaimed or abandoned property laws that require us to transfer to certain government authorities the unclaimed property of other that we hold when that property has been unclaimed for a certain period of time. Moreover, we are subject to audit by state and foreign regulatory authorities with regard to our escheatment practices.
Other Regulation
The Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 requires certain merchant acquiring entities and third-party settlement organizations to provide information returns for each calendar year with respect to payments made in settlement of electronic payment transactions and third-party payment network transactions occurring in that calendar year. Reportable transactions are also subject to backup withholding requirements. 
The foregoing is not an exhaustive list of the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject to and the regulatory framework governing our business is changing continuously.
Intellectual Property
We have developed a payments platform that includes many instances of proprietary software, code sets, workflows and algorithms. It is our practice to enter confidentiality, non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with other third parties to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology. In addition to these contractual measures, we also rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, registered domain names, and patent rights to help protect the Priority brand and our other intellectual property.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 870 employees, of which 863 were employed full-time. We have employees residing throughout the United States and India. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 14 


Growth and Development
Our strategy to develop and retain the best talent includes an emphasis on employee training and development. We promote our core values of ownership, innovation, camaraderie, service, authenticity and trust as an organization and offer awards to colleagues who exemplify these qualities. We require a mandatory online training curriculum for our employees that includes annual anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training.
Well-being and Safety during COVID-19 Pandemic
The success of our business is connected to the well-being of our employees. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate. This included enabling all of our employees to seamlessly shift to work from home. Over the past few years, we have made investments in our operating environments and technology that support day-to-day execution by employees working from home which allowed for the smooth transition. Additional health and safety measures have been implemented for employees who have elected to work within office locations.
Inclusion and Diversity
Our inclusion and diversity program focuses on our employees, workplace and community. We believe that our business is strengthened by a diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which we operate. We believe all of our employees should be treated with respect and equality, regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious beliefs or other characteristics. Inclusion and diversity remain a common thread in all of our human resource practices so that we can attract, develop and retain the best talent for our workforce.
