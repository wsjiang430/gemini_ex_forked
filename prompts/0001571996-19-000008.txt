ITEM 1 — BUSINESS
Business
Dell Technologies is a leading global end-to-end technology provider, with a comprehensive portfolio of IT hardware, software and service solutions spanning both traditional infrastructure and emerging, multi-cloud technologies that enable our customers to build their digital future and transform how they work and live. We operate eight complementary businesses: our Infrastructure Solutions Group and our Client Solutions Group, as well as VMware, Inc., Pivotal Software, Inc. (“Pivotal”), SecureWorks Corp. (“Secureworks”), RSA Security LLC (“RSA Security”), Virtustream Group Holdings, Inc. (“Virtustream”), and Boomi, Inc. (“Boomi”). Together our strategically aligned family of businesses collaborate across key functional areas such as technology and product development, marketing, go-to-market and global services, and are supported by Dell Financial Services. We believe this operational philosophy enables our platform to seamlessly deliver differentiated and holistic IT solutions to our customers, which has driven significant revenue growth and share gains.
Dell Technologies operates with significant scale and an unmatched breadth of unique and complementary offerings. Digital transformation has become essential to all businesses, and we have expanded our portfolio to include holistic solutions that enable our customers to drive their ongoing digital transformation initiatives. Dell Technologies’ integrated solutions help customers modernize their IT infrastructure, address workforce transformation, and provide critical security solutions to protect against the ever increasing and evolving security threats. With our extensive portfolio and our commitment to innovation, we have the ability to offer secure, integrated solutions that extend from edge to core to cloud, and we are at the forefront of the software-defined and cloud native infrastructure era. Our end-to-end portfolio is supported by a differentiated go-to-market engine, which includes a 40,000-person sales force, a global network of channel partners, and a world-class supply chain that together drive revenue growth and operating efficiencies. 
Products and Services
We design, develop, manufacture, market, sell, and support a wide range of products and services. We are organized into the following business units, which are our reportable segments: Infrastructure Solutions Group; Client Solutions Group; and VMware.

• | Infrastructure Solutions Group (“ISG”) — ISG enables the digital transformation of our customers through our trusted multi-cloud and big data solutions, which are built upon a modern data center infrastructure. Our comprehensive portfolio of advanced storage solutions includes traditional storage solutions as well as next-generation storage solutions (such as all-flash arrays, scale-out file, object platforms and software-defined solutions), while our server portfolio includes high-performance rack, blade, tower and hyperscale servers. Our networking portfolio helps our business customers transform and modernize their infrastructure, mobilize and enrich end-user experiences, and accelerate business applications and processes. Our strengths in server, storage, and virtualization software solutions enable us to offer leading converged and hyper-converged solutions, allowing our customers to accelerate their IT transformation by acquiring scalable integrated IT solutions instead of building and assembling their own IT platforms. ISG also offers attached software, peripherals and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services. 

We are continuing our journey to simplify our storage portfolio, with the goal of ensuring that we deliver the technology needed for our customers’ digital transformation. As our storage portfolio evolves, we will continue to support our current portfolio of storage solutions. 
Approximately half of ISG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region (“EMEA”) and the Asia-Pacific and Japan region (“APJ”).

• | Client Solutions Group (“CSG”) — CSG includes branded hardware (such as desktops, workstations, and notebooks) and branded peripherals (such as displays and projectors), as well as third-party software and peripherals. Our computing devices are designed with our commercial and consumer customers’ needs in mind, and we seek to optimize performance, reliability, manageability, design, and security. In addition to our traditional hardware business, we have a portfolio of thin client offerings that we believe will allow us to benefit from the growth trends in cloud computing. CSG hardware and services also provide the architecture to enable the Internet of Things and connected ecosystems to securely and efficiently capture massive amounts of data for analytics and actionable insights for commercial customers. CSG also offers attached software, peripherals, and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services. 

Approximately half of CSG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in EMEA and APJ.

• | VMware — The VMware reportable segment (“VMware”) reflects the operations of VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW) within Dell Technologies. See Exhibit 99.1 filed with this report for further details on the differences between VMware reportable segment results and VMware, Inc. results. 

VMware works with customers in the areas of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, modern applications, networking and security, and digital workspaces, helping customers manage their IT resources across private clouds and complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments. VMware’s portfolio supports and addresses the key IT priorities of customers: accelerating their cloud journey, empowering digital workspaces, and transforming networking and security. VMware solutions provide a flexible digital foundation to enable the digital transformation of VMware’s customers as they ready their applications, infrastructure, and devices for their future business needs.
Approximately half of VMware revenue is generated by sales to customers in the United States. 
Our other businesses, described below, consist of product and service offerings of Pivotal, Secureworks, RSA Security, Virtustream, and Boomi, each of which is majority-owned by Dell Technologies. These businesses are not classified as reportable segments, either individually or collectively, as the results of the businesses are not material to our overall results and the businesses do not meet the criteria for reportable segments.

• | Pivotal (NYSE: PVTL) provides a leading cloud-native platform that makes software development and IT operations a strategic advantage for customers. Pivotal’s cloud-native platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, accelerates and streamlines software development by reducing the complexity of building, deploying and operating new cloud-native applications, and modernizing legacy applications. In April 2018, Pivotal completed a registered underwritten initial public offering of its Class A common stock. 


• | Secureworks (NASDAQ: SCWX) is a leading global provider of intelligence-driven information security solutions singularly focused on protecting its clients from cyber attacks. The solutions offered by Secureworks enable organizations of varying size and complexity to fortify their cyber defenses to prevent security breaches, detect malicious activity in near real time, prioritize and respond rapidly to security incidents and predict emerging threats. 


• | RSA Security provides essential cybersecurity solutions engineered to enable organizations to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks, confirm and manage identities, and, ultimately, help reduce IP theft, fraud, and cybercrime.


• | Virtustream offers cloud software and infrastructure-as-a-service solutions that enable customers to migrate, run, and manage mission-critical applications in cloud-based IT environments. Beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, Virtustream results are reported within other businesses, rather than within ISG. This change in reporting structure did not impact our previously reported consolidated financial results, but our prior period segment results have been recast to reflect the change. 


• | Boomi specializes in cloud-based integration, connecting information between existing on-premise and cloud-based applications to ensure business processes are optimized, data is accurate and workflow is reliable.

As the integration of our family of businesses matures, we believe the increasing collaboration, innovation, and coordination of the operations and strategies of our businesses, as well as our differentiated go-to-market model, will continue to drive revenue synergies. Through our coordinated research and development activities, we are able to jointly engineer leading innovative solutions that incorporate the distinct set of hardware, software, and services across our businesses.
See Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information about our other businesses.
For further discussion regarding our current reportable segments, see “Part II — Item 7 —Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Business Unit Results.”
Dell Financial Services
Dell Financial Services and its affiliates (“DFS”) support our businesses by offering and arranging various financing options and services for our customers in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. DFS originates, collects, and services customer receivables primarily related to the purchase of our product, software, and service solutions. We also arrange financing for some of our customers in various countries where DFS does not currently operate as a captive. DFS further strengthens our customer relationships through its flexible consumption models, which enable us to offer our customers the option to pay over time and, in certain cases, based on utilization, providing them with financial flexibility to meet their changing technological requirements. The results of these operations are allocated to our segments based on the underlying product or service financed. For additional information about our financing arrangements, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Research and Development
We focus on developing scalable technology solutions that incorporate highly desirable features and capabilities at competitive prices. We employ a collaborative approach to product design and development in which our engineers, with direct customer input, design innovative solutions and work with a global network of technology companies to architect new system designs, influence the direction of future development, and integrate new technologies into our products. We manage our research and development (“R&D”) spending by targeting those innovations and products that we believe are most valuable to our customers and by relying on the capabilities of our strategic relationships. Through this collaborative, customer-focused approach, we strive to deliver new and relevant products to the market quickly and efficiently. Additionally, from time to time, we make strategic investments in publicly-traded and privately-held companies that develop software, hardware, and other technologies or provide services supporting our technologies.
VMware represents a significant portion of our R&D activities and has assembled an experienced group of developers with compute, storage, management, hybrid and public cloud, networking and security, traditional, cloud native and SaaS applications, digital workspace and mobility, container and open source software expertise. VMware also has strong ties to leading academic institutions around the world and invests in joint research with many such institutions. Product development efforts are prioritized through a combination of engineering-driven innovation and customer- and market-driven feedback. 
Dell Technologies has a global R&D presence, with total R&D expenses of $4.6 billion, $4.4 billion, and $2.6 billion for Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018, and Fiscal 2017, respectively. These investments reflect our commitment to R&D activities that ultimately support our mission: to help our customers build their digital future and to transform IT.
Manufacturing and Materials
We own manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Malaysia, China, Brazil, India, Poland, and Ireland. See “Item 2 — Properties” for information about our manufacturing and distribution facilities. 
We also utilize contract manufacturers throughout the world to manufacture or assemble our products under the Dell Technologies brand as part of our strategy to enhance our variable cost structure and to achieve our goals of generating cost efficiencies, delivering products faster, better serving our customers, and enhancing our world-class supply chain.
Our manufacturing process consists of assembly, software installation, functional testing, and quality control. We conduct operations utilizing a formal, documented quality management system to ensure that our products and services satisfy customer needs and expectations. Testing and quality control are also applied to components, parts, sub-assemblies, and systems obtained from third-party suppliers.
Our quality management system is maintained through the testing of components, sub-assemblies, software, and systems at various stages in the manufacturing process. Quality control procedures also include a burn-in period for completed units after assembly, ongoing production reliability audits, failure tracking for early identification of production and component problems, and information from customers obtained through services and support programs. This system is certified to the ISO 9001 International Standard that includes most of our global sites that design, manufacture, and service our products. 
Our order fulfillment, manufacturing, and test facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Ireland are certified to the ISO 14001 International Standard for environmental management systems and also have achieved OHSAS 18001 certification, an international standard for facilities with world-class safety and health management systems. These internationally-recognized endorsements of ongoing quality and environmental management are among the highest levels of certifications available. We also have implemented Lean Six Sigma and 7S (Customer, Safety, Quality, Delivery, Cost, Team, and Green) methodologies to ensure that the quality of our designs, manufacturing, test processes, and supplier relationships are continually improved. 
We maintain a robust Supplier Code of Conduct, actively manage recycling processes for our returned products, and are certified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a Smartway Transport Partner.
We purchase materials, supplies, product components, and products from a large number of qualified suppliers. In some cases, where multiple sources of supply are not available, we rely on single-source or a limited number of sources of supply if we believe it is advantageous to do so because of performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. We believe that any disruption that may occur because of our dependence on single- or limited-source vendors would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risk Factors Relating to Our Business and Our Industry — Reliance on vendors for products and components, many of which are single-source or limited-source suppliers, could harm Dell Technologies’ business by adversely affecting product availability, delivery, reliability, and cost” for information about the risks associated with Dell Technologies’ use of single- or limited-source suppliers.
Geographic Operations
Our global corporate headquarters is located in Round Rock, Texas. We have operations and conduct business in many countries located in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and other geographic regions. To increase our global presence, we continue to focus on emerging markets outside of the United States, Western Europe, Canada, and Japan. We continue to view these geographical markets, which include the vast majority of the world’s population, as a long-term growth opportunity. Accordingly, we pursue the development of technology solutions that meet the needs of these markets. Our expansion in emerging markets creates additional complexity in coordinating the design, development, procurement, manufacturing, distribution, and support of our product and services offerings. For information about the amount of net revenue we generated from our operations outside of the United States during the last three fiscal years, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Competition 
We operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware, software, and services offerings. We face ongoing product and price competition in all areas of our business, including from both branded and generic competitors. We compete based on our ability to offer customers competitive, scalable, and integrated solutions that provide the most current and desired product and services features at a competitive price. We closely monitor market pricing and solutions trends, including the effect of foreign exchange rate movements, in an effort to provide the best value for our customers. We believe that our strong relationships with our customers and channel partners allow us to respond quickly to changing customer needs and other macroeconomic factors.
The markets in which we compete are comprised of large and small companies across all areas of our business. We believe that new businesses will continue to enter these markets and develop technologies that, if commercialized, may compete with our products and services. Moreover, current competitors may enter into new strategic relationships with new or existing competitors, which may further increase the competitive pressures. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risk Factors Relating to Our Business and Our Industry” for information about our competitive risks. 
Sales and Marketing
We operate a diversified business model, with the majority of our revenue and operating income derived from commercial clients that consist of large enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses, and public sector customers. We sell products and services directly to customers and through other sales channels, such as value-added resellers, system integrators, distributors, and retailers. During Fiscal 2019, our other sales channels contributed over 50% of our net revenue. 
Our customers include large global and national corporate businesses, public institutions that include government, educational institutions, healthcare organizations, and law enforcement agencies, small and medium-sized businesses, and consumers. Our sales efforts are organized around the evolving needs of our customers, and our marketing initiatives reflect this focus. We believe that our unified global sales and marketing team creates a sales organization that is more customer-focused, collaborative, and innovative. Our go-to-market strategy includes a direct business model, as well as channel distribution. Our direct business model emphasizes direct communication with customers, thereby allowing us to refine our products and marketing programs for specific customers groups, and we continue to pursue this strategy. In addition to our direct business model, we rely on a network of channel partners to sell our products and services, enabling us to efficiently serve a greater number of customers.
We market our products and services to small and medium-sized businesses and consumers through various advertising media. To react quickly to our customers’ needs, we track our Net Promoter Score, a customer loyalty metric that is widely used across various industries. Increasingly, we also engage with customers through our social media communities on www.delltechnologies.com and in external social media channels.
For large business and institutional customers, we maintain a field sales force throughout the world. Dedicated account teams, which include technical sales specialists, form long-term relationships to provide our largest customers with a single source of assistance, develop tailored solutions for these customers, position the capabilities of Dell Technologies, and provide us with customer feedback. For these customers, we offer several programs designed to provide single points of contact and accountability with dedicated account managers, special pricing, and consistent service and support programs. We also maintain specific sales and marketing programs targeting federal, state, and local governmental agencies, as well as healthcare and educational customers.
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
As of February 1, 2019, we held a worldwide portfolio of 16,541 patents and had an additional 9,310 patent applications pending. Of those intellectual property rights, VMware, Inc. owned 2,928 patents and had an additional 2,879 patent applications pending. We also hold licenses to use numerous third-party patents. To replace expiring patents, we obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development activities. The inventions claimed in our patents and patent applications cover aspects of our current and possible future computer system products, manufacturing processes, and related technologies. Our product, business method, and manufacturing process patents may establish barriers to entry in many product lines. Although we use our patented inventions and also license them to others, we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. We have entered into a variety of intellectual property licensing and cross-licensing agreements and software licensing agreements with other companies. We anticipate that our worldwide patent portfolio will continue to be of value in negotiating intellectual property rights with others in the industry.
We have obtained U.S. federal trademark registration for the Dell word mark and logo mark and the VMware word and logo mark.  We have pending applications to register Dell EMC word marks. As of February 1, 2019, we owned registrations for approximately 305 of our other trademarks in the United States and had pending applications for registration of approximately 100 other trademarks. We believe that Dell Technologies, DELL, Dell EMC, VMware, Alienware, RSA Security, Secureworks, Pivotal, and Virtustream word marks and logo marks in the United States are material to our operations. As of February 1, 2019, we also had applied for, or obtained registration of, the DELL word mark and several other marks in approximately 186 other countries.
From time to time, other companies and individuals assert exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights to technologies or marks that are alleged to be relevant to the technology industry or our business. We evaluate each claim relating to our products and, if appropriate, seek a license to use the protected technology. The licensing agreements generally do not require the licensor to assist us in duplicating the licensor’s patented technology, nor do the agreements protect us from trade secret, copyright, or other violations by us or our suppliers in developing or selling the licensed products.
Unless otherwise noted, trademarks appearing in this report are owned by us. We disclaim proprietary interest in the marks and names of others. Net Promoter Score is a trademark of Satmetrix Systems, Inc., Bain & Company, Inc., and Fred Reichheld. 
Government Regulation and Sustainability
Government Regulation — Our business is subject to regulation by various U.S. federal and state governmental agencies and other governmental agencies. Such regulation includes the activities of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission; the anti-trust regulatory activities of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the European Union; the consumer protection laws and financial services regulation of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and various state governmental agencies; the export regulatory activities of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of the Treasury; the import regulatory activities of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the product safety regulatory activities of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the U.S. Department of Transportation; the health information privacy and security requirements of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; and the environmental, employment and labor, and other regulatory activities of a variety of governmental authorities in each of the countries in which we conduct business. We were not assessed any material environmental fines, nor did we have any material environmental remediation or other environmental costs, during Fiscal 2019.
Our Philosophy on Sustainability — One of the core tenets of Dell Technologies is the belief that technology drives human progress. We remain committed to putting our technology and expertise to work where it can do the most good for people and our planet. This commitment is intimately tied to our business goals of driving growth, helping mitigate risk, and ensuring business opportunities by building our brand. Based on the idea that we all win when we create shared value, we created goals in 2013 that build on the strengths throughout our value chain to create social, environmental, and economic value by uniting our purpose with our business objectives. These goals spanned the material areas of our business and set out our ambitions for 2020.
The following are key areas of focus from our 2020 plan:
Creating Net Positive Outcomes — Creating net positive outcomes means putting back more into society, the environment, and the global economy than we take out. In particular, we focus on helping customers harness the power of technology to deliver better social and environmental outcomes. 
Product Energy Efficiency — We have set a goal to reduce the energy intensity of our entire product portfolio by 80% by 2020. 
Technology Take-back, Reuse, and Recycling — We begin thinking about recycling at the design phase, asking our product engineers to work with recyclers to understand how to make products easy to repair or disassemble for recycling. When our products reach the end of their life cycles, we make it easy for customers to recycle their obsolete electronic equipment. 
Circular Economy and Design for the Environment — Recycling, reuse, and closed-loop manufacturing form the bedrock of the circular economy, ensuring that materials already in circulation stay in the economy instead of exiting as waste. Within our own operations, we look at how materials can be used, or reused, in ways that extend their value. 
Reducing Our Footprint, Caring for Our Planet — We are focused on reducing the impact of our operations on the environment. Our teams examine practices and processes throughout our facilities to identify other opportunities for greater efficiency. Many of our locations purchase some or all of their electricity from renewable sources and many of our manufacturing facilities are approaching zero waste to landfill. 
Further, Dell Technologies is committed to maintaining the vitality of our oceans with our work concerning ocean-bound plastics, where we are processing plastics collected from beaches, waterways, and coastal areas and incorporating them into our packaging. We have made a pledge to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to increase our annual use of ocean plastics by 10 times by 2025 and to help build further demand by convening a working group with other manufacturers to create an open-source ocean plastics supply chain. To that end, we are working to bring together a cross-industry consortium of global companies that also are committed to scaling the use of ocean-bound plastics. 
Social and Environmental Responsibility in the Supply Chain — We are committed to responsible business practices and hold ourselves and our suppliers to a high standard of excellence. We work in partnership with our suppliers to reduce risks that could lead to harm of workers, production suspensions, factory shut-downs, or environmental damage. All of our suppliers must agree to our global supplier principles and accept the Responsible Business Alliance (formerly known as the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition) Code of Conduct. Additionally, we are committed to a conflict-free mineral supply chain. 
Youth Learning — Technology skills are critical to continued innovation and can have a profound effect on our businesses, communities, and sustainability. We have a strong commitment to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math and other youth learning activities, providing funding, volunteer time, and technology to underserved populations. 
Partnering with TGen — Together with the Translational Genomics Research Institute (“TGen”), we are changing the paradigm in the treatment of childhood cancers. We developed the Genomic Data Analysis Platform — a complete high-performance computing infrastructure solution uniquely designed to meet the needs of genomic data collection and analysis. Over the past six years, we have increased computational capacity over three times, and increased storage speeds and capacity to over four times that of the original systems, thereby reducing the time it takes to sequence a genome from multiple weeks to just six hours.
Our Fiscal 2018 Corporate Social Responsibility Report is available at www.dell.com/crreport, and our Fiscal 2019 report is expected to be available in June 2019. The VMware Fiscal 2018 Global Impact Report is available at www.vmware.com/company/sustainability, and the Fiscal 2019 report is expected to be available in September 2019.
Product Backlog
Product backlog represents the value of unfulfilled manufacturing orders. Our business model generally gives us the ability to optimize product backlog at any point in time, for example, expediting shipping or prioritizing customer orders toward products that have shorter lead times. Because product backlog at any point in time may not result in the generation of any predictable amount of net revenue in any subsequent period, we do not believe product backlog to be a meaningful indicator of future net revenue. Product backlog is included as a component of remaining performance obligation to the extent we determine that the manufacturing orders are non-cancelable.
Employees
As of February 1, 2019, we had approximately 157,000 total full-time employees, approximately 24,000 of whom were employees of VMware, Inc. In comparison, as of February 2, 2018, we had approximately 145,000 total full-time employees, approximately 22,000 of whom were employees of VMware, Inc. As of February 1, 2019, approximately 37% of our full-time employees were located in the United States and approximately 63% were located in other countries.
Corporate Information 
We are a holding company that conducts our operations through subsidiaries.
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on January 31, 2013 under the name Denali Holding Inc. in connection with Dell’s going-private transaction, which was completed in October 2013. We changed our name to Dell Technologies Inc. on August 25, 2016. The mailing address of our principal executive offices is One Dell Way, Round Rock, Texas 78682. Our telephone number is 1-800-289-3355.
Our website address is www.delltechnologies.com.  We make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The contents of our website are not a part of this annual report on Form 10-K.
Class V Transaction
On December 28, 2018, we completed a transaction, referred to as the “Class V transaction,” pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of July 1, 2018 and amended as of November 14, 2018, between Dell Technologies and Teton Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Dell Technologies. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub was merged with and into Dell Technologies (the “Merger”), with Dell Technologies continuing as the surviving corporation.
Dell Technologies completed the Class V transaction following approval of the transaction by its stockholders at a special meeting held on December 11, 2018. Dell Technologies paid $14 billion in cash and issued 149,387,617 shares of its Class C Common Stock in connection with the Class V transaction. The Class C Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) on a when-issued basis as of the opening of trading on December 26, 2018 and on a regular-way basis as of the opening of trading on December 28, 2018. The Class V Common Stock ceased trading on the NYSE prior to the opening of trading on December 28, 2018.
The Class V Common Stock was a type of common stock intended to track the economic performance of a portion of Dell Technologies interest in the Class V Group, which consisted solely of VMware, Inc. common stock held by the Company. As a result of the Class V transaction, pursuant to which all outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock ceased to be outstanding, the tracking stock feature of Dell Technologies’ capital structure was terminated. The Class C Common Stock issued to former holders of the Class V Common Stock represents an interest in the Company’s entire business and, unlike the Class V Common Stock, is not intended to track the performance of any distinct assets or business. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that went into effect as of the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) prohibits Dell Technologies from issuing shares of Class V Common Stock.
At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Class V Common Stock was exchanged for either (1) $120.00 in cash, without interest, subject to a cap of $14 billion on the aggregate cash consideration, or (2) 1.8066 shares of Class C Common Stock. The exchange ratio was calculated based on the aggregate amount of cash elections described below, as well as the aggregate volume-weighted average price per share of Class V Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported on Bloomberg) of $104.8700 for the period of 17 consecutive trading days that began on November 28, 2018 and ended on December 21, 2018.
Of the 199,356,591 shares of Class V Common Stock outstanding as of the record date for the Class V transaction:

• | cash elections were made with respect to 181,897,352 shares, or 91.2% of the total outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock; and


• | share elections (including deemed share elections with respect to shares for which no elections were made) were made with respect to 17,459,239 shares, or 8.8% of the total outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock.

Class V stockholders elected in the aggregate to receive approximately $21.8 billion in cash, which exceeded the $14 billion cap on the aggregate cash consideration. As a result, the cash consideration was subject to a proration factor of approximately 0.6414, which was calculated by dividing the $14 billion cap on the aggregate cash consideration by approximately $21.8 billion of total cash elections. Each Class V stockholder that elected to receive cash for its shares of Class V Common Stock became entitled to receive cash consideration for such number of shares, prorated by the proration factor, and to receive shares of Class C Common Stock for its remaining Class V Common Stock, together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Class C Common Stock.
At the Effective Time and unless otherwise agreed by Dell Technologies and a holder of a Class V Common Stock-based equity award granted by us (a “Class V Award”), each Class V Award was converted into a new equity award on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements and deferral provisions) with respect to the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that was equal to the number of shares of Class V Common Stock that were subject to the Class V Award multiplied by 1.8066 (rounded down to the nearest whole share). The exercise price for any Class V Award options so converted was equal the exercise price of such Class V Award options immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by 1.8066 (rounded up to the nearest whole penny).
Immediately following the completion of the Class V transaction, Dell Technologies had approximately 171,909,324 outstanding shares of Class C Common Stock (or approximately 206,478,102 shares on a fully diluted basis, before applying the treasury stock method) and approximately 718,434,605 shares of common stock in total (or approximately 763,912,474 shares on a fully diluted basis, before applying the treasury stock method).
The aggregate cash consideration and the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Class V transaction were funded with proceeds of $3.67 billion from new term loans under our senior secured credit facilities, proceeds of a margin loan financing in an aggregate principal amount of $1.35 billion, proceeds of Dell Technologies’ pro-rata portion, in the amount of $8.87 billion, of a special $11 billion cash dividend paid by VMware, Inc. in connection with the Class V transaction, and cash on hand at Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for information about the debt incurred by Dell Technologies to finance the Class V transaction.
The Merger Agreement and Dell Technologies’ amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for certain corporate governance changes that will be implemented following the closing of the Merger. Among such changes, Dell Technologies has agreed that, no later than June 30, 2019, (1) Dell Technologies’ board of directors will appoint a fourth director who meets the independence requirements of the NYSE (an “independent director”) to the board of directors after consultation with holders of Class C Common Stock and (2) Dell Technologies will establish a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the board of directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is expected to be initially composed of Michael Dell, as chair, and Egon Durban, who currently serve as directors, and one independent director. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for the ability of holders of Class C Common Stock, voting separately as a series, to elect one director beginning with the second annual meeting of stockholders of Dell Technologies following the closing of the Merger and annually thereafter.
