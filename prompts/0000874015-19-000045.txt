Item 1. Business
 
We are a leader in discovering and developing RNA-targeted therapeutics with sustained and growing revenues. We have created an efficient and broadly applicable drug discovery platform leveraging our expertise in antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics that we believe has fundamentally changed medicine and transformed the lives of people with devastating and often deadly diseases. Our large, diverse and advanced pipeline of over 40 first-in-class and/or best-in-class medicines addresses diseases across a broad range of therapeutic areas, targeting small, medium and large patient populations.
 
We have two commercial medicines approved in major markets around the world, SPINRAZA and TEGSEDI. We have at least four medicines that have entered pivotal studies or have the potential to begin pivotal studies this year, and another six medicines that could start pivotal studies in 2020. These medicines, along with the more than 30 additional medicines in our pipeline, represent multiple potential drivers of value for years to come. We believe our efficient drug discovery platform, coupled with our innovation-centric business model, provides us with the flexibility to determine the optimal development and commercialization strategy to maximize the commercial opportunity for each of our medicines and ensure that we continue to produce transformative medicines for patients who need them. We believe we are positioned to drive substantial value for patients and shareholders.
 
As of January 2019, SPINRAZA was approved in over 40 countries around the world, and our partner Biogen, who is responsible for global SPINRAZA commercial activities, reported that more than 6,600 patients are now on SPINRAZA therapy. In addition, Biogen plans to continue to pursue regulatory filings in additional countries. Biogen reported 2018 annual sales of SPINRAZA of more than $1.7 billion, and we earned $238 million in commercial revenues from royalties on sales of SPINRAZA. SPINRAZA is the first and only approved medicine for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA. SPINRAZA is the established standard-of-care for all people with this progressive, debilitating and often fatal genetic disease. In November 2018, SPINRAZA was recognized with the 2018 International Prix Galien award as Best Biotechnology Product. This prestigious honor marks the seventh Prix Galien award for SPINRAZA.
 
TEGSEDI, a once weekly, self-administered subcutaneous medicine, was approved in 2018 in the U.S., EU and Canada for the treatment of polyneuropathy caused by hereditary TTR amyloidosis, or hATTR, in adult patients. hATTR is a debilitating, progressive, and fatal disease. Akcea, our majority-owned affiliate focused on developing and commercializing medicines to treat patients with rare and serious diseases, launched TEGSEDI globally in late 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we earned more than $2 million in TEGSEDI product sales. Akcea has an exclusive license agreement with PTC Therapeutics, or PTC, to commercialize TEGSEDI in Latin America. In January 2019, PTC filed an application for regulatory approval in Brazil with ANVISA, the Brazilian regulatory authority. ANVISA granted priority review for TEGSEDI.
 
We and Akcea are preparing to commercialize WAYLIVRA in the EU. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization for WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the European Commission, or EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the EU, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. With this positive opinion, and, pending adoption of the positive opinion by the EC, Akcea plans to leverage its existing commercial infrastructure in Europe to market WAYLIVRA. Akcea is continuing to conduct open-label extension and early access programs. We are also focused on regulatory discussions in the U.S. We are developing WAYLIVRA to treat familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL, a second severe and rare, genetically defined disease. FCS and FPL are orphan diseases characterized by severely high triglyceride levels that result in severe, daily symptoms and a high risk of life-threatening pancreatitis.
 
In addition to commercializing TEGSEDI and preparing to commercialize WAYLIVRA, Akcea is developing four other clinical-stage medicines: AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx (TQJ230), AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-TTR-LRx, each of which could potentially treat multiple patient populations. Moving these drugs into Akcea allows us to retain substantial value from these medicines and ensures our core focus remains on innovation. As of February 2019, we owned approximately 75 percent of Akcea.
 
We are continuously advancing our technology and pipeline to provide the most value to patients. We have a pipeline of over 40 medicines that, like SPINRAZA and TEGSEDI, have the potential to transform the treatment of diseases with no adequate treatment today. These medicines range from treatments for rare diseases with small patient populations to more common diseases afflicting millions of patients. Our pipeline covers a broad spectrum of therapeutic areas, such as cardiometabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, severe and rare diseases and others. We believe our large and diverse pipeline contains many near-, mid- and longer-term growth drivers for the company.
 
Our pipeline includes at least 10 potentially transformative medicines anticipated to enter pivotal clinical studies in the next two years. We anticipate at least four of these medicines will enter pivotal studies this year including: AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-TTR-LRx, IONIS-HTTRx (RG6042) and IONIS-SOD1Rx. Roche recently initiated a Phase 3 study of IONIS-HTTRx for Huntington’s disease, or HD. We believe each of these medicines is a first-in-class and/or best-in-class medicine with the potential to deliver significant value to patients and shareholders. We anticipate that the data from these pivotal studies, if positive, will support global regulatory filings for each medicine.
 
AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx (TQJ230) – In February 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and we earned a $150 million license fee. Novartis is responsible for conducting and funding all future development and commercialization activities for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, including a global pivotal cardiovascular outcomes study, for which planning and initiation activities are underway. AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx targets a cardiovascular risk factor, lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a). Lp(a) is well-recognized by the medical community as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Lp(a) is genetically determined at birth and there are currently no treatments available to substantially and specifically lower Lp(a). In September 2018, we reported dose-dependent and substantial reductions in Lp(a) levels in the Phase 2 clinical study in patients with established cardiovascular disease, or CVD, due to elevated levels of Lp(a), which was also the longest and largest study, regardless of phase, conducted with a LICA antisense medicine to date. Approximately 98 percent of patients who received the highest dose in the study demonstrated a reduction in Lp(a) levels to below 50 mg/dL, the recognized threshold for risk of CVD. In addition, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the study.

AKCEA-TTR-LRx – We are developing AKCEA-TTR-LRx for the treatment of people with all forms of TTR amyloidosis as a once a month or even less frequent subcutaneous self-administered injection. In April 2018, we licensed to Akcea the worldwide rights to commercialize TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx. We plan to report data from the Phase 1/2 study this year, followed by the initiation of a pivotal program. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in patients with hereditary TTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy first, followed closely by a Phase 3 study in patients with wild type and hereditary TTR cardiomyopathy, also planned for this year.
 
IONIS-HTTRx (RG6042) – Roche initiated the Phase 3 study of IONIS-HTTRx for HD in December 2018 and we earned a $35 million milestone payment when the first patient was dosed in the Phase 3 study in January 2019. HD is a genetic, devastating and fatal neurodegenerative disease that negatively affects psychological, cognitive and motor functions. In March 2018, we reported data from a Phase 1/2 study that demonstrated up to a 60 percent reduction in the mutant huntingtin protein, or mHTT, as observed in the cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF. It was the first study to demonstrate disease-modifying potential in HD patients. Based on preclinical data, the mHTT reductions of 40-60 percent in the CSF are predicted to result in 55-85 percent reduction in the cortex of the brain, where mHTT is highly expressed. IONIS-HTTRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the study.
 
IONIS-SOD1Rx (BIIB067) – IONIS-SOD1Rx, for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is the fourth medicine we anticipate we will move into pivotal studies this year. ALS is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons  in the brain and spinal cord resulting in an inability to control muscle movement.  Scientists have identified mutations within multiple genes as causative of ALS, including mutations in the SOD1 gene. IONIS-SOD1Rx directly targets the SOD1 gene and is delivered intrathecally into the CSF. The average life expectancy for an ALS patient with the SOD1 mutation is less than five years from the time of diagnosis. Based on the positive interim analysis from the Phase 1/2 study that demonstrated proof-of-biology and proof-of-concept, in December 2018, Biogen exercised its licensing option with us to develop and commercialize IONIS-SOD1Rx. IONIS-SOD1Rx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the study. Biogen plans to add an additional cohort to this study to potentially support registration. We earned $40 million in payments from Biogen in the fourth quarter of 2018 when Biogen advanced and licensed IONIS-SOD1Rx.
 
 The depth of our knowledge and expertise with antisense technology together with our strong financial position provides us the flexibility to partner our medicines at what we believe is the optimal time to maximize the near-term, mid-term and long-term value of our medicines. We have a distinct partnering strategy based on each specific medicine and the expertise and resources we and our potential partners may bring to a collaboration. We may develop and commercialize some medicines through affiliates. In general, these are medicines, like TEGSEDI, that can benefit from our internal expertise and infrastructure, have manageable development costs and have the potential for initial rare disease indications. For other medicines, we may establish collaborations to advance the medicine. We have alliances with a cadre of leading global pharmaceutical companies that are working alongside us in developing our medicines, advancing our technology, preparing to commercialize our medicines and selling our medicines. Our partners include the following companies, among others: AstraZeneca, Bayer, Biogen, GSK, Janssen, Novartis and Roche. Our partners bring resources and expertise that augment and build upon our internal capabilities. For example, we partnered AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx with Novartis because we believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise that should accelerate our ability to deliver AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx to the large population of patients with  elevated levels of Lp(a) and established CVD. As a result of Novartis exercising its option for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in February 2019, Novartis is responsible for conducting and funding all future development and commercialization activities, including a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study Novartis is planning to conduct. We are eligible to earn additional payments from Novartis as AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx progresses.


We are now a multi-product commercial company. 2018 marks our seventh consecutive year of revenue growth. Through our partnerships, we have earned significant commercial revenue and a broad and sustaining base of research and development, or R&D, revenue in the form of license fees, upfront payments and milestone payments, while investing in advancing our pipeline and technology. Moreover, we have the potential to earn over $20 billion in future milestone payments and licensing fees from our current partnerships. We also have the potential to share in the future commercial success of our inventions and drugs resulting from our partnerships through royalty arrangements. Looking forward, we believe we have the potential to increase our commercial revenue from SPINRAZA royalties and TEGSEDI product sales from the continued growth we anticipate in the U.S., EU and other markets globally. We also have the potential to further increase our commercial revenue with the potential approval of WAYLIVRA.
 
We ended 2018 with a strong balance sheet with more than $2 billion in cash and short-term investments, making this the sixth year out of seven that we have been cash accretive. Our strong balance sheet provides us with the financial wherewithal to invest in expanding and advancing our pipeline, in commercializing our medicines through commercial affiliates, and advancing our technology.

Our Marketed Medicines – Transformational Medicines Bringing Value to Patients Today
 
SPINRAZA – SPINRAZA (nusinersen) injection for intrathecal use is a survival motor neuron-2, or SMN2, directed antisense oligonucleotide indicated for the treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult patients. SPINRAZA is the first and only approved medicine for the treatment of SMA and is the established standard-of-care for all people around the globe with this progressive, debilitating genetic disease. SPINRAZA is approved in over 40 countries around the world. In February 2019, SPINRAZA was approved by the China National Medical Products Association. Our partner, Biogen, who is responsible for global SPINRAZA commercial activities, reported in January 2019 that approximately 6,600 patients were on SPINRAZA therapy. Biogen reported 2018 annual sales of more than $1.7 billion, and we earned $238 million in commercial revenues from royalties on sales of SPINRAZA.
 
SMA is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. Ultimately, individuals with the most severe type of SMA, infantile-onset, or Type 1, SMA, can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing. Due to a loss of, or defect in, the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron, or SMN, protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein a patient can produce on his/her own. Patients with Type 1 SMA produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support or live beyond two years without respiratory support. Patients with later-onset, or Type 2 or Type 3 SMA, produce greater amounts of SMN protein and have less severe, but still life-altering, forms of SMA.
 
SPINRAZA was recognized with the 2018 International Prix Galien Best Biotechnology Product award. The prestigious honor marks the seventh Prix Galien award for SPINRAZA, following country recognitions in the U.S., Germany, Italy, Belgium-Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the U.K. The International Prix Galien award is given every two years by Prix Galien International Committee members in recognition of excellence in scientific innovation to improve human health.
 
Biogen is conducting NURTURE, a Phase 2 open-label study of SPINRAZA in pre-symptomatic infants. Biogen presented an interim analysis of the NURTURE data at the Annual Congress of the World Muscle Society in October 2018. The interim analysis showed that SPINRAZA-treated infants achieved motor milestones in timelines more consistent with normal development than what is observed in the natural history of patients with Type 1 SMA. At the time of the interim analysis, all patients were alive and did not require respiratory intervention. All of the infants in the study were able to sit without support and 88 percent of the infants were able to walk either with assistance or independently. No new safety concerns were identified.
 
The safety and efficacy of SPINRAZA has been evaluated in multiple clinical studies in more than 270 patients, including two Phase 3 studies: ENDEAR, a randomized controlled study evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with infantile-onset SMA, and CHERISH, a randomized controlled study evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with later-onset SMA.
 
In the ENDEAR end of study analysis, or EOS, a statistically significant greater percentage of children with infant-onset SMA achieved improvement in motor milestones compared to untreated patients, with some infants in the SPINRAZA group achieving full head control, the ability to roll, sit, and stand. Additionally, infants treated with SPINRAZA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in event-free survival compared to untreated patients.
 
In the CHERISH EOS there was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in motor function in children with later-onset SMA treated with SPINRAZA compared to untreated children. The majority of children treated with SPINRAZA demonstrated benefits in upper limb and general motor function, including crawling and standing with support. The overall findings from the CHERISH EOS analysis continue to support the robust efficacy and favorable safety profile of SPINRAZA across a broad patient population.
 
In all clinical studies, SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The most common side effects of SPINRAZA included lower and upper respiratory infections, constipation, headache, back pain, and post-lumbar puncture syndrome. For additional safety information, please see www.spinraza.com (Any information that is included on or linked to this website is not part of this report or any registration statement or report that incorporates this report by reference).
 
TEGSEDI – TEGSEDI (inotersen) injection is a Generation 2+ antisense medicine and the world’s first and only approved subcutaneous RNA-targeting medicine designed to treat people with polyneuropathy caused by hATTR. In October 2018, the FDA approved TEGSEDI for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults. TEGSEDI is also approved in the EU and Canada for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. It is administered as a once weekly, self-administered, at-home, subcutaneous injection. In March 2018, Akcea licensed TEGSEDI from us.
 
TTR amyloidosis that is the result of inherited mutations in the TTR gene is referred to as hATTR. There are an estimated 50,000 people worldwide with hATTR. There are two primary manifestations of hATTR: polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Many people with hATTR often experience both manifestations, but often one manifestation or the other is diagnosed first and is more pronounced.
 
In people with hATTR, both the mutant and wild type, or wt, TTR protein builds up as fibrils in the tissues, such as peripheral nerves, heart, gastrointestinal system, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow. The presence of TTR fibrils interferes with the normal function of these tissues. As the TTR protein fibrils enlarge, more tissue damage occurs and the disease worsens, resulting in poor quality of life and eventually death. We designed TEGSEDI to reduce the production of the TTR protein, the underlying cause of transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR.
 
 6
 
Polyneuropathy due to hATTR is caused by the accumulation of misfolded mutated TTR protein in the peripheral nerves. People with polyneuropathy due to hATTR experience ongoing debilitating nerve damage throughout their body resulting in the progressive loss of sensation in the extremities that advances centrally, and loss of motor functions, such as walking. These people also accumulate TTR in other major organs, which progressively compromises their function and eventually leads to death within five to 15 years of disease onset. Cardiomyopathy caused by ATTR is the accumulation of misfolded TTR protein in the cardiac muscle.
 
ATTR can also result from normal, non-mutant, TTR protein forming fibrils, primarily in the heart. This form of the disease is wt-ATTR. It is estimated that more than 200,000 people worldwide have wt-ATTR. People with hATTR cardiomyopathy and wt-ATTR experience ongoing debilitating heart damage resulting in progressive heart failure, which results in death within three to five years from disease onset.
 
The TEGSEDI approval relied on results from the Phase 3 NEURO-TTR study in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with stage 1 and stage 2 polyneuropathy. Results from that study demonstrated that patients treated with TEGSEDI experienced significant benefit compared to patients treated with placebo across both co-primary endpoints: the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy, or Norfolk QoL-DN, and modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7, or mNIS+7, a measure of neuropathic disease progression. In July 2018, the final results from the NEURO-TTR pivotal study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
 
Thrombocytopenia and safety signals related to renal function were identified during the study. Enhanced monitoring was implemented during the study to support early detection and management of these issues. Serious platelet and renal events were infrequent and manageable with routine monitoring, which has proven effective since implementation.
 
Additionally, at the 60th American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting and Exposition held in December 2018, we presented data from the open-label extension study, or OLE, in patients with hATTR treated with TEGSEDI. The OLE is an ongoing study and is intended to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety profile of TEGSEDI. The benefits observed from TEGSEDI in the NEURO-TTR study continued in the OLE. In addition, the OLE results demonstrated that patients who initiated TEGSEDI treatment at the start of the NEURO-TTR study, 15 months earlier, experienced greater benefit than those who received placebo treatment in the NEURO-TTR study and then initiated treatment in the OLE. Patients who began the NEURO-TTR study on placebo experienced a rapid onset of effect following TEGSEDI treatment that has been sustained for up to 2 years in the OLE. These patients further experienced improvements in quality of life and activities of daily living as measured by Norfolk QoL-DN and showed improved mNIS+7 progression compared to their rate of progression in the NEURO-TTR study. Specifically, these patients experienced a mean increase in Norfolk QoL-DN of 16.8, a 10 point improvement over projected placebo values and a mean increase in mNIS+7 of 34 points from baseline, a 24 point improvement over projected placebo values. No new safety concerns were identified in the OLE.
 
The product label for TEGSEDI in the U.S. has a boxed warning for thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis and requires periodic blood and urine monitoring. TEGSEDI has a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program. For TEGSEDI’s full prescribing information, including boxed warnings, please see www.tegsedi.com (Any information that is included on or linked to this website is not part of this report or any registration statement or report that incorporates this report by reference).
 
We developed TEGSEDI under a collaboration agreement we had with GSK. Under the agreement, we are required to pay GSK a nominal royalty on net sales of TEGSEDI.
 
See our separate section below where we further discuss Akcea, our affiliate focused on developing and commercializing medicines to treat people with serious and rare diseases.
 
 Drug Discovery and Development
 
Introduction to Drug Discovery
    Proteins are essential working molecules in a cell. Almost all human diseases result from inappropriate protein production, improper protein activity or loss of a protein. Antisense medicines can modify the production of proteins by targeting RNAs. In this way, antisense medicines can reduce the production of a disease-causing protein, modify the protein produced or increase the production of a protein that, when absent, causes diseases. Antisense medicines also can treat diseases by targeting and reducing RNAs that may be causing diseases (so called “toxic RNAs”). RNAs are naturally occurring molecules in the body that primarily act as messengers that carry the information the cell needs to produce proteins from the DNA/genes to the protein making complex in the cell. When our antisense medicines bind to the specific RNAs of a particular gene, they will ultimately alter the production of the protein encoded in the target gene or, in the case of disease-causing RNAs, degrade the toxic RNA.
Our Development Projects
    We are a leader in the discovery and development of an exciting class of RNA-targeted medicines called antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, medicines, or just antisense medicines. With our proprietary drug discovery platform, we can rapidly identify medicines from a wealth of potential targets to treat a broad range of diseases. We focus our efforts in therapeutic areas in which our medicines will work best, efficiently screening many targets in parallel and carefully selecting the best candidates. By combining this efficiency with our rational approach to selecting disease targets, we have built a large and diverse portfolio of medicines we designed to treat a variety of health conditions, such as cardiometabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, severe and rare diseases and others. We are developing antisense medicines for systemic and local delivery (e.g., intrathecal, intraocular, oral and aerosol).

We plan to continue to add new medicines to our pipeline, building a broad proprietary portfolio of medicines to treat many diseases and creating opportunities to generate substantial revenue. We also continue to improve our scientific understanding of our medicines, including how our medicines impact the biological processes of the diseases we target.
 
With our expertise in discovering and characterizing novel antisense medicines, our scientists can optimize the properties of our antisense medicines against each particular target. Our scientists have made significant advances in chemical modifications we use in our antisense medicines, such as with our Generation 2+ antisense medicines, which have increased potency and an improved side effect profile over our earlier generation medicines. Our scientists have further improved upon our second-generation chemistry with our Generation 2.5 chemistry, an advancement that further increases the potency of our medicines, which broadens the organs and tissues in which our medicines can work. We currently have 13 Generation 2.5 medicines in development, and we anticipate that more of our future medicines will incorporate our Generation 2.5 chemistry.
 
In addition to improving the chemical foundation of our medicines, we have also created LIgand-Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology, which we design to enhance the effective uptake and activity of our medicines in particular tissues. With our LICA technology we attach specific chemical structures or molecules to our antisense medicines. With our first LICA conjugate, a complex sugar-like molecule called N-acetylgalactosamine, or GalNac, we have shown an increase in medicinal potency of over 30-fold for liver targets, compared to non-conjugated antisense medicines. We currently have 13 LICA medicines in development, including two medicines that combine our Generation 2.5 chemistry and LICA technology.
    We have utilized our chemistry advancements, such as Generation 2.5 and LICA, to expand the therapeutic and commercial opportunities of our pipeline. These advancements, along with the manufacturing and analytical processes that are the same for all of our medicines, shorten our timeline from initial concept to the first human dose, when compared to early development timelines for other drug modalities like small molecule and antibody drugs.
 


The above table lists the medicines in our pipeline that are in registration for marketing authorization or in clinical trials. The table includes the disease indication, a partner (if the medicine is partnered), and the development status of each medicine. Typically, the names of our medicines incorporate the target of the medicine. For example, with IONIS-HTTRx, the RNA produced from the huntingtin gene, represented by the acronym HTT, is the target of the medicine. Unless indicated otherwise, the majority of medicines in our pipeline are Generation 2+ antisense medicines. We differentiate medicines discovered at Ionis but being developed by Akcea by using “AKCEA”, instead of “IONIS” at the beginning of the medicine name, such as AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. We differentiate our Generation 2.5 medicines by adding a “2.5” notation at the end of the medicine name, such as IONIS-JBI1-2.5Rx. We differentiate our LICA medicines by adding an “L” at the end of the medicine name, such as IONIS-PKK-LRx. As the medicines in our pipeline advance in clinical development, we will adopt nonproprietary names given to each medicine from the U.S. Adopted Names Council. For example, inotersen is a nonproprietary name that we obtained for IONIS-TTRRx. Once we or our partners establish a brand name, we will adopt the brand name. For example, TEGSEDI is the brand name for inotersen.

With a pipeline as large and advanced as ours, we have a number of clinical events each year as we initiate new clinical studies, complete and report data from clinical studies, and add numerous new medicines to our pipeline.
 
WAYLIVRA – Potential Approval in Europe Following Positive CHMP Opinion
 
WAYLIVRA (volanesorsen) – WAYLIVRA is a Generation 2+ antisense medicine we and Akcea are developing to treat people with FCS and FPL, which are severe, rare, genetically defined diseases characterized by extremely elevated triglyceride levels and a high risk of life-threatening pancreatitis. We are preparing to commercialize WAYLIVRA in the EU.
 
In February 2019, the CHMP of the EMA adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization for WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed FCS who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the EU, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. With this positive opinion, and, pending adoption of the positive opinion by the EC, Akcea plans to leverage its existing commercial infrastructure in Europe to market WAYLIVRA.
 
In August 2018, we received a complete response letter, or CRL, from the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products of the FDA regarding the NDA for WAYLIVRA. We are continuing our discussions with the FDA regarding WAYLIVRA.
 
Due to the high levels of triglycerides in their blood, people with FCS may suffer from many chronic health issues including severe, recurrent abdominal pain, fatigue, high risk of life-threatening pancreatitis and abnormal enlargement of the liver or spleen. It is estimated to affect 3,000 to 5,000 people in treatable markets. In addition, people with FCS must adhere to a very strict, low-fat diet. FPL is a rare, orphan disease that is estimated to affect 3,000 to 5,000 patients worldwide. Patients with FPL typically have diabetes and other metabolic abnormalities, including elevated triglycerides, which increases their risk of pancreatitis. As a result of these factors, people with FCS and FPL are often unable to work, adding to the burden of these diseases. In severe cases, patients can have bleeding into the pancreas, serious tissue damage, infection and cyst formation, as well as damage to other vital organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys.
 
WAYLIVRA acts to reduce triglyceride levels by inhibiting the production of apolipoprotein C-III, or apoC-III, a protein that is a key regulator of triglyceride levels. People who have low levels of apoC-III or reduced apoC-III function have lower levels of triglycerides and a lower incidence of CVD. By inhibiting the production of apoC-III, WAYLIVRA is able to reduce their triglyceride levels.
 
The marketing authorization application for WAYLIVRA is based on results from the Phase 3 APPROACH study and the ongoing APPROACH Open Label Extension, or OLE, study and supported by results from the Phase 3 COMPASS study. The pivotal APPROACH study, a one-year, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 66 patients with FCS (average baseline triglycerides of 2,209 mg/dL, or 25.0 mmol/L), achieved its primary endpoint of reduction in triglycerides at three months, with a 77 percent mean reduction in triglycerides, which translated into a 1,712 mg/dL (19.3 mmol/L) mean absolute triglyceride reduction in WAYLIVRA-treated patients. We observed 50 percent of treated patients achieved triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL, a commonly accepted threshold for pancreatitis risk. In addition, in the APPROACH study, treatment with WAYLIVRA was associated with a statistically significant reduced rate of pancreatitis attacks in the group of patients who had the highest incidence of pre-study pancreatitis and reduced abdominal pain in patients reporting pain before treatment in the study.
 
The most common adverse event in the studies was injection site reactions, which were mostly mild. In addition, declines in platelet counts were observed in many patients and some patients discontinued the study because of platelet declines. These platelet declines were not clinically significant in most patients and were generally well managed with monitoring and dose adjustment. Some patients discontinued participation in the APPROACH study due to other non-serious adverse events, including sweating and chills, severe fatigue, rash and injection site reaction. In the APPROACH study and the open-label extension study, the potentially treatment- related serious adverse events, or SAEs, observed were serious platelet events (grade 4 thrombocytopenia), which resolved without complication after cessation of dosing. Enhanced monitoring was implemented during the study to support early detection and management of these issues. Since implementation of the enhanced monitoring, serious platelet events have been infrequent. The COMPASS study, a six-month randomized placebo-controlled study in 113 patients with very high triglycerides (>500 mg/dL), also achieved its primary endpoint of reduction in triglycerides at three months, with a 71 percent mean reduction in triglycerides. In the COMPASS study, treatment with WAYLIVRA was associated with a statistically significant reduction in on-study pancreatitis attacks. The most common adverse event in the WAYLIVRA-treated group of patients was injection site reactions, which were mostly mild. In addition, a potentially treatment-related SAE of serum sickness reaction, from which the patient fully recovered, was reported. There have been no deaths and no treatment-related bleeding or cardiovascular events in any WAYLIVRA clinical study.
 
We are conducting the BROADEN study, a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with FPL, with data anticipated this year.
 
An open-label extension study is ongoing for patients with FCS who have completed or meet the study criteria for the APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Additionally, we have expanded access programs, or EAPs, for WAYLIVRA. Patients in the BROADEN study are also eligible to roll over into an open-label extension study upon completing dosing in the pivotal study. We plan to commercialize WAYLIVRA through Akcea for patients with FCS and FPL, if approved in other markets.
 
Potential Next Wave of Pivotal Medicines
 
Focusing on our key fundamental strategies has created a deep and broad pipeline of over 40 first-in-class and/or best-in-class medicines that we believe have the potential to deliver significant value to patients affected by these devastating diseases, many of which have limited treatment options. We have at least four medicines that have begun pivotal studies or have the potential to begin pivotal studies this year.

AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx (TQJ230) – AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is a Generation 2+ LICA medicine we designed to reduce the production of apolipoprotein(a), or Apo(a), protein in the liver to offer a direct approach for reducing lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for CVD that is composed of an apolipoprotein(a) protein bound to an LDL-cholesterol particle. Akcea initiated a collaboration with Novartis in January 2017 to advance AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx.
 
Akcea is developing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx for people who are at significant risk of CVD because of their elevated levels of Lp(a). AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx inhibits the production of the Apo(a) protein, thereby reducing Lp(a). Lp(a) is a very atherogenic and thrombogenic form of LDL. Elevated Lp(a) is recognized as an independent, genetic cause of coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke and peripheral arterial disease. Inhibiting the production of Apo(a) in the liver reduces the level of Lp(a) in blood, potentially slowing down or reversing cardiovascular disease in people with hyperlipoproteinemia(a), a condition in which individuals have levels of Lp(a) greater than 50 mg/dL.
 
Lp(a) is difficult to inhibit using other technologies, such as small molecules and antibodies. There are multiple genetically-determined forms of the Apo(a) molecule and creating a small molecule or antibody that can interact with multiple targets is difficult. We believe antisense technology is well suited to address hyperlipoproteinemia(a) because antisense technology specifically targets the RNA that codes for all forms of the Apo(a) molecule. As a result, it can stop the production of all the forms of the protein. Furthermore, we believe addressing elevated Lp(a) is the next important horizon in lipid-focused treatment.
 
We reported results of the Phase 2 study with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a) at the American Heart Association, or AHA, annual meeting in November 2018. In this clinical study, we observed statistically significant and dose dependent reductions from baseline in Lp(a) levels. Approximately 98 percent of patients who received the highest dose in the study demonstrated a reduction in Lp(a) levels to below 50 mg/dL, the recognized threshold for risk of CVD. This study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx was the longest and largest clinical study in patients with established CVD and elevated levels of Lp(a). This study was also the longest and largest clinical study of any of our LICA medicines. AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the study. Compliance in the study was almost 90 percent, which was higher than what we observed in the placebo group.
 
In February 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and Novartis’ preparations to initiate Phase 3 a cardiovascular outcomes study are already underway
 
AKCEA-TTR-LRx – We are co-developing AKCEA-TTR-LRx with Akcea to inhibit the production of transthyretin, the same protein inhibited by TEGSEDI (inotersen). There are two types of ATTR amyloidosis: hATTR amyloidosis and wt-ATTR amyloidosis.
 
We are developing AKCEA-TTR-LRx for the treatment of people with all forms of TTR amyloidosis as a once a month or even less frequent subcutaneous self-administered injection. We plan to report data from the Phase 1/2 study this year, followed by the initiation of a pivotal program. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in patients with hereditary TTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy first, followed closely by a Phase 3 study in patients with wild type and hereditary TTR cardiomyopathy, also planned for this year.
 
IONIS-HTTRx – IONIS-HTTRx (RG6042) is a Generation 2+ antisense medicine we designed to target the underlying cause of HD by reducing the production of the toxic mHTT protein. Roche initiated the Phase 3 study of IONIS-HTTRx for Huntington’s disease, or HD, in December 2018 and the first patient was dosed in the Phase 3 study in January 2019. In addition to the Phase 3 study, all participants who took part in the Phase 1/2 study are eligible to continue to receive IONIS-HTTRx as part of an OLE study to assess the safety and tolerability of IONIS-HTTRx. In parallel with the Phase 3 study and the OLE, Roche initiated a natural history study in a similar patient population to the OLE. The natural history study is planned as a 15-month observational study aimed at further understanding the role of mHTT in disease progression and is anticipated to include up to 100 participants with Stage I and II HD. There is no drug treatment in the observational study, as the goal is to understand the natural progression of HD.
 
We completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation, Phase 1/2 clinical study of IONIS-HTTRx in patients with early stage HD. In this study, we observed dose-dependent reductions of mHTT among patients treated with IONIS-HTTRx and IONIS-HTTRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. In March 2018, we reported data from the study that demonstrated up to a 60 percent reduction in the mHTT as observed in the CSF. It was the first study to demonstrate disease-modifying potential. The mHTT reductions of 40-60 percent in the CSF correspond to an estimated 55-85 percent reduction in the cortex of the brain, where mHTT is highly expressed, based on preclinical data. There were no serious adverse events reported and no participants discontinued from the study. In August 2018, the EMA granted PRIME designation to IONIS-HTTRx. EMA PRIME status is granted to medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options. The FDA and EMA granted Orphan Medicine Designation for IONIS-HTTRx to treat people with HD.

HD is a rare, inherited, genetic brain disorder that results in the progressive deterioration of mental abilities and physical control. In the U.S., there are approximately 30,000 individuals with symptomatic HD and more than 200,000 people at risk of inheriting HD. HD is a triplet repeat disorder and is one of a large family of genetic diseases in which the body mistakenly repeats certain gene sequences. The resulting mHTT protein is toxic and gradually damages neurons in the brain. Symptoms of HD usually appear between the ages of 30 to 50 years and continually worsen over a 10 to 25-year period. Ultimately, the weakened individual succumbs to pneumonia, heart failure or other complications. Presently, there are no disease-modifying treatments available for HD patients, with current drugs only managing some disease symptoms.
 
We entered into a collaboration with Roche to develop and commercialize antisense medicines to treat HD in April 2013. In December 2017, Roche exercised its licensing option to develop and commercialize IONIS-HTTRx following the completion of a Phase 1/2 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study of IONIS-HTTRx in people with HD. Roche is responsible for all IONIS-HTTRx development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs.
 
IONIS-SOD1Rx (BIIB067) – IONIS-SOD1Rx is a Generation 2+ antisense medicine we designed to reduce the production of superoxide dismutase 1, or SOD1, which is a well understood genetic cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. We are collaborating with Biogen to develop IONIS-SOD1Rx to treat people with an inherited form of ALS, SOD1-ALS.
 
ALS is a rare, fatal, neurodegenerative disorder. People with ALS suffer progressive degeneration of the motor neurons, which results in a declining quality of life and ultimately death. The second most common familial form of ALS is SOD1-ALS, in which people have a mutation in the SOD1 gene that causes a progressive loss of motor neurons. As a result, people with SOD1-ALS experience muscle weakness, loss of movement, difficulty breathing and swallowing and eventually succumb to the disease. Currently, treatment options for people with ALS are extremely limited, with no medicines that significantly slow disease progression.
 
In December 2018, Biogen exercised its licensing option to develop and commercialize IONIS-SOD1Rx based on the positive interim analysis from the Phase 1/2 study that demonstrated proof-of-biology and proof-of-concept. Biogen is responsible for all IONIS-SOD1Rx development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs. At the highest dose tested, treatment with IONIS-SOD1Rx over a three month period resulted in a statistically significant lowering of SOD1 protein levels in the CSF and positive numerical trends across three efficacy endpoints: slowing of clinical decline as measured by the ALS functional rating scale-revised, slowing of decline in respiratory function as measured by vital capacity and slowing of decline in muscle strength as measured by a handheld device, all compared to placebo. The safety and tolerability profile in this study supports the continued development of IONIS-SOD1Rx in ALS.
 
Biogen plans to add an additional cohort to this study to potentially support registration of IONIS-SOD1Rx.
 
Neurological Disease Franchise
 
We are discovering and developing antisense medicines to treat people with inadequate treatment options for both common and rare neurological diseases. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, or NINDS, at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, a third of the 7,000 known rare diseases are neurological disorders or thought to include a neurological component.

IONIS-MAPTRx – IONIS-MAPTRx is a Generation 2+ antisense medicine we designed to selectively reduce production of the tau protein in the brain. We are collaborating with Biogen to develop IONIS-MAPTRx to treat people with Alzheimer’s disease, or AD, and frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, common forms of dementia.
 
 11
 
Microtubule-associated protein tau, or tau, is a contributor or cause of certain neurodegenerative diseases, known as tauopathies, characterized by the deposition of abnormal tau protein in neurons and non-neuronal cells in the brain. AD and FTD are characterized by predominant memory impairment and behavioral changes, resulting in a person’s inability to independently perform daily activities. AD generally occurs late in life and may progress to death in five to 20 years after the onset of the disease. FTD has a more rapid disease progression. There are approximately five million people living with AD in the U.S. and approximately 55,000 people affected by FTD in the U.S.
 
We and Biogen are evaluating IONIS-MAPTRx in a Phase 1/2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and activity of once-monthly intrathecal injections in patients with mild AD. We are planning to report data from this study in 2020.
 
IONIS-C9Rx – IONIS-C9Rx, also referred to as BIIB078, is a Generation 2+ antisense medicine we designed to selectively reduce the production of the mutated chromosome 9 open reading frame 72, or C9ORF72, gene. A mutation in this gene results in an inherited form of ALS, referred to as C9ORF72-ALS, the most prevalent genetic cause of ALS worldwide. There is substantial evidence that this mutation is responsible for a toxic gain of function repeat expansion that can lead to rapid progressive loss of motor neurons in people with C9ORF72-ALS. This is a fatal disease characterized by muscle weakness, loss of movement, and difficulty breathing and swallowing. We believe IONIS-C9Rx represents a novel approach to targeting ALS, for which there is no cure.
 
We and Biogen are collaborating to develop IONIS-C9Rx to treat patients with this form of ALS. In August 2018, we initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating IONIS-C9Rx in patients with C9ORF72-ALS. The current study is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple ascending doses of IONIS-C9Rx administered intrathecally to adults with C9ORF72-ALS. IONIS-C9Rx is the second medicine from our Biogen collaboration targeting a familial form of ALS. The first is IONIS-SOD1Rx, designed to treat SOD1 related ALS, caused by a mutation in the SOD1 gene.
 
Severe and Rare Disease Franchise
 
Our severe and rare disease franchise is one the largest franchises in our pipeline. We are discovering and developing antisense medicines to treat people with severe and rare diseases who need new treatment options. We believe our antisense technology could offer effective therapies for these people. According to the NIH there are approximately 7,000 rare diseases, many life-threatening or fatal. Unfortunately, people with many of these severe and rare diseases have few effective therapies available. Since most of these diseases are genetic or have a genetic component, parents often pass the disease to their children, creating a legacy of the disease resulting in profound effects on the family. Due to the severe nature of these diseases and the lack of available treatments, there is an opportunity for more flexible and efficient development paths to the market. For example, SPINRAZA was approved five years after we began the Phase 1 study for it.

AKCEA-TTR-LRx – See the medicine description “Next Wave of Pivotal Medicines” section above.
 
IONIS-GHR-LRx – IONIS-GHR-LRx is a Generation 2+ LICA medicine we designed to reduce the production of the growth hormone receptor, or GHr, to decrease the circulating level of insulin-like growth factor-1, or IGF-1. IGF-1 is a hormone primarily produced in the liver that plays an important role in childhood growth and has anabolic effects in adults. Several different diseases result from abnormally low or high levels of IGF-1, or an inappropriate response to this hormone. When produced in excess, IGF-1 results in acromegaly, a chronic, and life-threatening disease.
 
High levels of circulating GH and IGF-1 lead to this multisystem disease characterized by organ overgrowth and physical disfigurement, such as enlarged hands, feet, and facial features. Patients with acromegaly also experience multiple co-morbidities, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory complications, as well as premature mortality. Because IGF-1 mediates the majority of the growth-promoting action of GH, reducing GHr production could in turn decrease levels of IGF-1 and provide a potential treatment to patients with acromegaly. Acromegaly is a rare disease with an estimated 25,000 patients in the U.S. Current treatments to block IGF-1 include surgical removal of the pituitary gland, which is often unsuccessful. Drug treatments to normalize IGF-1 levels are also available but are associated with potentially serious side effects.

We have completed a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of IONIS-GHR-LRx in healthy volunteers. In this study, IONIS-GHR-LRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. There were no reports of deaths, serious adverse events or adverse events that led to study discontinuation. IONIS-GHR-LRx has the potential to bring substantial benefit to patients with acromegaly with at home, monthly subcutaneous administration.
 
In November 2018, we initiated the Phase 2 proof of concept clinical study of IONIS-GHR-LRx in acromegaly patients. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in acromegaly patients uncontrolled on select long-acting somatostatin receptor ligands. Patients in the study will receive monthly subcutaneous injections for four months. We anticipate we will complete this study by the end of this year.
 
IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx – IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx is a Generation 2+ LICA medicine we designed to reduce the production of transmembrane protease, serine 6, or TMPRSS6, to treat anemia and iron toxicity in people with β-thalassemia, a disease caused by mutations in the beta globin gene. TMPRSS6 is a protein produced in the liver that is important in the regulation of the body’s iron homeostasis through the control of the iron regulatory protein hepcidin. Inhibition of TMPRSS6 leads to increased production of hepcidin, which results in more effective red blood cell production in the bone marrow and reduced iron toxicity in the liver as a result of improved control of iron availability.
 
Patients with β-thalassemia can experience severe anemia, marrow expansion, bone deformities, as well as iron toxicity. While the severity of anemia varies between patients, iron toxicity is a common complication leading to high rates of mortality as a result of iron accumulation in major organs, such as the heart and liver. Currently there are no effective therapies for patients with β-thalassemia. The current standard of care is managing patients’ symptoms with blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, and iron chelation.
 
β-thalassemia can be further subdivided into patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, or TDT, and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia, or NTDT, including β-thalassemia intermedia. Although transfusions are not needed to support life in patients with NTDT, the associated complications of the disease are severe and often fatal. There are approximately 20,000 people in North America and Europe who suffer from β-thalassemia intermedia.
 
Results from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that reducing levels of TMPRSS6 may be an effective strategy to control iron availability, improve liver iron toxicity and increase red blood cell production under conditions of β-thalassemia. In December 2018, we presented positive Phase 1 data at the ASH Annual Meeting. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, we demonstrated dose-dependent reductions of serum iron and serum transferrin saturation. Additionally, we observed an increase in serum hepcidin and predicted changes in hemoglobin. IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile.
 
We are planning to begin the Phase 2 proof of concept study of IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx this year.
 
IONIS-PKKRx and IONIS-PKK-LRx – IONIS-PKKRx and IONIS-PKK-LRx are antisense medicines we designed to reduce the production of prekallikrein, or PKK, to treat people with hereditary angioedema, or HAE. It is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by rapid and painful attacks of inflammation in the hands, feet, limbs, face, abdomen, larynx and trachea and can be fatal if swelling occurs in the larynx. PKK plays an important role in the activation of inflammatory mediators associated with acute attacks of HAE. By inhibiting the production of PKK, IONIS-PKKRx and IONIS-PKK-LRx could be effective prophylactic approaches to preventing HAE attacks. In patients with frequent or severe attacks, doctors may use prophylactic treatment approaches to prevent or reduce the severity of HAE attacks.
 
We have completed a Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-PKKRx in healthy volunteers and we are exploring potential development options. In this study, IONIS-PKKRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. We are currently evaluating IONIS-PKK-LRx in a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers. The Phase 1 study is evaluating single and multiple doses of IONIS-PKK-LRx administered subcutaneously.
 
IONIS-ENAC-2.5Rx – IONIS-ENAC-2.5Rx is a Generation 2.5 antisense medicine we designed to selectively reduce epithelial sodium channel, or EnaC, to treat people with cystic fibrosis, or CF. CF is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR. CFTR is a chloride channel expressed in epithelial cells, including those in the lung. Targeting ENAC may enable treatment of all forms of CF due to various CFTR mutations, unlike existing therapeutics. CF is a multisystem disease that mostly affects the lungs, clogging airways due to mucus build-up and resulting in inflammation and infection. This disease is characterized by a progressive decline in lung function with acute periods of worsened symptoms, known as pulmonary exacerbations. CF is estimated to affect approximately 30,000 people in the U.S. and another 70,000 worldwide. Despite progress with other treatments, there remains a need for effective treatment options.
 
Antisense aerosol technology for lung delivery may provide a novel solution for targeting ENaC potentially enabling all patients with CF to be treated. In preclinical studies in transgenic rodents, treatment with ENaC-targeting antisense drugs specifically suppressed ENaC expression, resulting in the reduction of markers of CF mucus pathology and improved lung function. Treatment prevented manifestations of the disease from occurring and reversed existing CF.
 
In December 2018, we initiated a Phase 1 study of healthy volunteers in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IONIS-ENAC-2.5Rx. The study will consist of four randomized single-dose cohorts and four multiple-dose cohorts.

Cardiometabolic and Renal Disease Franchise
 
Cardiovascular disease is an important area of focus for us. According to the World Health Organization, or WHO, cardiovascular disease was the number one cause of death globally. An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVD in 2016, representing 31 percent of all deaths globally. The medicines in our cardiovascular franchise target the key components of cardiovascular disease, including various atherogenic lipids, inflammation and thrombosis. Metabolic disorders are chronic diseases that affect tens of millions of people. There is a significant need for new therapies for these people. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, diabetes affects more than 30 million people in the U.S., or nine percent of the population, with type 2 diabetes constituting 90 percent of those cases.
IONIS’ Cardiometabolic and Renal Disease Clinical Pipeline
 

AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx – AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is a Generation 2+ LICA medicine we designed to reduce the production of the angiopoietin-like 3, or ANGPTL3, protein. We and Akcea are developing AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx to treat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD.
 
People with elevated levels of the angiopoietin-like 3, or ANGPTL3, protein have high LDL-C and triglyceride levels. Studies show this elevation is associated with an increased risk of premature heart attacks, increased arterial wall thickness, increased liver fat and multiple metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance. In contrast, people with lower levels of ANGPTL3 have lower LDL-C and triglyceride levels, and thus lower risk of heart attacks, lower prevalence of fatty liver and lower incidence of metabolic disorders.
 
In preclinical studies, an analog of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx inhibited the production of the ANGPTL3 protein in the liver, resulting in lower liver fat accumulation and lower blood levels of LDL-C, triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or VLDL-C. In addition, our preclinical data and initial Phase 1 data suggest that inhibiting the production of ANGPTL3 could improve other lipid parameters, including triglyceride levels and total cholesterol, as well as metabolic parameters, such as insulin sensitivity.
 
We have completed a Phase 1/2 program for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in healthy volunteers with elevated triglycerides. Results for the initial cohort from this study were reported at the AHA meeting in November 2016 and the data were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. We observed that the people with elevated triglycerides achieved dose-dependent, statistically significant mean reductions in ANGPTL3 of up to 83 percent. Treatment with AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx was also associated with statistically significant mean reductions in triglycerides of up to 66 percent, in LDL-C of up to 35 percent and in total cholesterol of up to 36 percent. In this study, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with NAFLD with metabolic complications, which include hypertriglyceridemia, type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. We are planning to report data from this study in 2020.
 
Further, we have a small ongoing study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with rare hyperlipidemias.
 
IONIS-FXIRx and IONIS-FXI-LRx – IONIS-FXIRx and IONIS-FXI-LRx are antisense medicines we designed to reduce the production of Factor XI. Factor XI is a clotting factor produced in the liver that is important in the growth of blood clots. High levels of Factor XI increase the risk of thrombosis, which is the formation of a blood clot inside blood vessels. Thrombosis can cause heart attacks and strokes. People who are deficient in Factor XI have a lower incidence of thromboembolic events with minimal increase in bleeding risk. Although currently available anticoagulants reduce the risk of thrombosis, physicians associate these anticoagulants with increased bleeding, which can be fatal. Given the mechanism of Factor XI inhibition, we believe that our medicine can be used broadly as an anti-thrombotic in many different therapeutic settings for which additional safe and well tolerated anti-thrombotic medicines are needed.
 
We completed a Phase 2 open-label, comparator-controlled global study evaluating IONIS-FXIRx in people undergoing total knee replacement surgery. The study compared the safety and activity of IONIS-FXIRx to enoxaparin. In this study patients treated with 300 mg of IONIS-FXIRx experienced a seven-fold lower rate of venous thromboembolic events, such as blood clots in a deep vein or in a lung, compared to those patients treated with enoxaparin. In this study, IONIS-FXIRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The data from this study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in December 2014.
 
In May 2015, we exclusively licensed IONIS-FXIRx to Bayer.
 
 14
 
In November 2016, we completed a Phase 2 double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study of IONIS-FXIRx in people with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. In this Phase 2 study, patients treated with IONIS-FXIRx achieved statistically significant, dose-dependent reductions in Factor XI activity. In this study, IONIS-FXIRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. There were no treatment-related major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events.
 
We are currently evaluating IONIS-FXIRx in a Phase 2b study in people with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis to finalize dose selection. We are planning to report data from this study this year.
 
In February 2017, we amended our agreement with Bayer to advance IONIS-FXIRx and to initiate development of IONIS-FXI-LRx. We plan to develop IONIS-FXI-LRx through Phase 1. The Phase 1 study is in progress in healthy volunteers. It is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study that will assess the safety and efficacy of IONIS-FXI-LRx.
 
AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx – See the medicine description under “Next Wave of Pivotal Medicines” section above.
 
AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx – AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx is a LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of apoC-III, the same protein inhibited by WAYLIVRA, for the broad population of people who are at risk for cardiometabolic disease due to their elevated triglyceride levels. We and Akcea are developing AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. ApoC-III impacts triglyceride levels and may also increase inflammatory processes. This combination of effects makes apoC-III a promising target for people with LDL-C already controlled on statin therapy, but for whom triglycerides remain poorly controlled. We believe that the enhancements offered by our LICA technology can provide greater patient convenience by allowing for significantly lower doses and less frequent administration, compared to WAYLIVRA.
 
In October 2017, we reported positive results of a Phase 1/2 clinical study in healthy volunteers with elevated triglyceride levels. Patients in the study were treated with multiple doses at either weekly or monthly dosing intervals. Patients treated with AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx demonstrated significant dose-dependent reductions in apoC-III protein and triglycerides. In this study, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. No serious adverse events, platelet count reductions, changes in liver function or adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were observed.
 
Novartis entered into a collaboration with us in January 2017 to advance AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. In the first quarter of 2018, we initiated a Phase 2b dose-ranging study of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and established CVD. We plan to report data from this study in 2020.
 
IONIS-DGAT2Rx – IONIS-DGAT2Rx is a Generation 2+ antisense medicine we designed to reduce the production of DGAT2, or diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, to treat people with NASH. NASH is a common liver disease characterized by excessive triglycerides in the liver with concurrent inflammation and cellular damage. As NASH progresses, scarring, or fibrosis, begins to accumulate in the liver. Ultimately, cirrhosis of the liver develops. Currently, it is estimated that two to three percent of the general population have NASH. With the growing obesity epidemic, the number of people with NASH should also continue to rise. About 20 percent of people with NASH are reported to have a liver that does not function properly due to long-term damage, known as cirrhosis. Of those with NASH-related cirrhosis, 30 - 40 percent experience liver-related death. Currently, liver transplantation is the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis and liver failure. Because of the high prevalence of NASH, it has recently become the third most common indication for liver transplantation in the U.S.
 
DGAT2 is an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in triglyceride synthesis in the liver. Reducing the production of DGAT2 should therefore decrease triglyceride synthesis in the liver. In animal models of obesity and fatty liver disease, antisense inhibition of DGAT2 significantly improved NAFLD, lowered blood lipid levels and reversed diet-induced insulin resistance. NASH is a more severe form of NAFLD.
 
IONIS-DGAT2Rx was evaluated in a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. In December 2018, we reported that IONIS-DGAT2Rx substantially reduced liver fat after only three months of treatment. 50 percent of IONIS-DGAT2Rx treated patients had relative liver fat reductions of greater than or equal to 30 percent. IONIS-DGAT2Rx demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no safety concerns related to the liver, kidney or platelets. Additionally, there were no increased levels of triglycerides or cholesterol. We plan to develop a liver LICA version of IONIS-DGAT2Rx.
 
IONIS-AGT-LRx – IONIS-AGT-LRx is a Generation 2+ LICA medicine we designed to reduce the production of angiotensinogen to decrease blood pressure in people with treatment resistant hypertension, or TRH. Despite the availability of generic antihypertensive agents, TRH is a major contributor to cardiovascular and renal disease.
 
Approximately 75 million adults in the U.S. have hypertension, half of whom have uncontrolled hypertension. About 12-15 percent of patients with uncontrolled hypertension have resistant hypertension, defined as failure to achieve a blood pressure goal of 140/90 (systolic/diastolic) despite the use of three or more antihypertensive medications. Current estimates approximate that there are up to three million people with TRH in the U.S. People with TRH have been found to have a three-fold higher chance of having fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events relative to those with controlled hypertension.
 
We are evaluating IONIS-AGT-LRx in a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study in people with mild hypertension.

Oncology Franchise and Other Medicines in Development
 
Cancer is an area of significant unmet medical need. Cancer is an extremely complex disease that involves a large number of targets. Using our antisense technology, we can validate multiple potential cancer targets from a variety of different cancers, and rapidly identify anti-cancer drugs, which in many cases are the same or similar sequences to those used to validate the target. We preferentially select anti-cancer targets that can potentially provide a multi-faceted approach to treating cancer.
 
Our oncology franchise consists of anti-cancer antisense medicines that act upon biological targets associated with cancer progression, treatment resistance, and/or the tumor immune environment. We have a strategic alliance with AstraZeneca, which includes an anti-cancer collaboration that expands our anti-cancer efforts and supports a robust clinical development plan for danvatirsen and IONIS-AZ7-2.5Rx. AstraZeneca brings significant experience that enables the identification of novel genetic and epigenetic targets for cancer. Combining AstraZeneca’s expertise with our drug discovery technology, we plan to expand our oncology franchise with a number of promising new anti-cancer targets. We also have a collaboration agreement with University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to identify cancer targets and create novel antisense medicines to treat cancer together.
 
Our Generation 2.5 chemistry enhances the potency and effectiveness of our antisense medicines, and potentially allows us to extend the applicability of our technology to cancers that are difficult to treat. For instance, STAT3 is a protein known to be important in carcinogenesis, however, it has been difficult to approach with traditional drug modalities. Data from a Phase 1b/2 clinical study of danvatirsen in combination with durvalumab, AstraZeneca’s programmed death ligand, or PD-L1, blocking antibody showed evidence of antitumor activity in people with advanced solid tumors and recurrent metastatic head and neck cancer.
 
IONIS’ Oncology/Other Clinical Pipeline
 

Danvatirsen (formerly IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx) – Danvatirsen is a Generation 2.5 antisense medicine we designed to reduce the production of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, or STAT3, to treat people with cancer. STAT3 is a protein involved in the translation of key factors critical for tumor cell growth and survival. STAT3 is over-active in a variety of cancers, including brain, lung, breast, bone, liver and multiple myeloma. Physicians believe that overactivity in STAT3 prevents cancer cell death and promotes tumor cell growth. Danvatirsen is a part of our collaboration with AstraZeneca to discover and develop anti-cancer medicines. We believe the significant potency we observed in our preclinical studies with danvatirsen broadens the therapeutic opportunities danvatirsen into many different types of cancer in which STAT3 is implicated.
 
In October 2018, we and AstraZeneca announced new data from a Phase 1b/2 study of danvatirsen in combination with durvalumab in recurrent metastatic head and neck cancer. The combination treatment resulted in seven percent of patients achieving a complete tumor response and 23 percent achieving either a partial or complete tumor response. This response rate is estimated to be double that with durvalumab alone, based on previous studies in this difficult to treat patient population. Results from this study demonstrated safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
AstraZeneca is evaluating danvatirsen in a range of cancer types as part of a broader oncology partnership evaluating Generation 2.5 antisense therapies against undruggable targets either alone or in combination with immuno-oncology agents, including in non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer and head and neck cancer.
 
IONIS-AR-2.5Rx – IONIS-AR-2.5Rx, also known as AZD5312, is a Generation 2.5 antisense medicine we designed to treat people with prostate cancer by reducing the production of all known forms of androgen receptor, or AR, including variants of the AR gene. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. Prostate cancer growth, proliferation and progression are all androgen-dependent and AR function is involved in disease progression at all stages of prostate cancer.
 
An open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 1/2 clinical study of IONIS-AR-2.5Rx was completed in people with advanced tumors for which the androgen receptor pathway is potentially a contributing factor. The study was primarily conducted in prostate cancer patients and it showed durable responses in a number of those patients. The medicine exhibited a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development. In March 2017, we licensed IONIS-AR-2.5Rx to Ribo to develop and commercialize the medicine in China.

IONIS-HBVRx and IONIS-HBV-LRx – IONIS-HBVRx and IONIS-HBV-LRx are antisense medicines we designed to reduce the production of viral proteins associated with hepatitis B virus, or HBV. These include proteins associated with infection and replication, including the hepatitis B surface antigen, which is present in both acute and chronic infections and is associated with a poor prognosis in people with chronic HBV infection. IONIS-HBV-LRx is our first anti-infective medicine in development that incorporates our LICA technology. Together with GSK, we are evaluating IONIS-HBVRx and IONIS-HBV-LRx to treat HBV infection.
 
HBV infection is a serious health problem that can lead to significant and potentially fatal health conditions, including cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection is one of the most common persistent viral infections in the world. Currently available therapies, although effective in reducing circulating HBV in the blood, do not effectively inhibit HBV antigen production and secretion, which are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of liver cancer.
 
We and GSK are evaluating both IONIS-HBVRx and IONIS-HBV-LRx in Phase 2 studies designed to reduce production of viral proteins associated with HBV infection.
 
IONIS-FB-LRx – IONIS-FB-LRx is a Generation 2+ LICA medicine we designed to reduce the production of complement factor B, or FB. FB is produced predominantly in the liver and circulates at high levels throughout the vascular system where it plays a pivotal role in an innate immunogenic cascade. Genetic association studies have shown that overactivity of this cascade has been associated with the development of several complement-mediated diseases, including dry age-related macular degeneration, or AMD.
 
In May 2017, we reported data from a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-FB-LRx in 54 healthy volunteers. Subjects treated with a single dose of IONIS-FB-LRx achieved dose-dependent reductions in plasma FB of up to 50 percent. Treatment with multiple doses of IONIS-FB-LRx during a six-week period resulted in greater reductions in circulating FB levels. In this study, IONIS-FB-LRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile.
 
In October 2018, we entered into a new collaboration with Roche to develop IONIS-FB-LRx for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. The first indication that we and Roche agreed to pursue is the treatment of patients with geographic atrophy, or GA, the advanced stage of dry AMD. We plan to start a Phase 2 study of IONIS-FB-LRx in people with dry AMD this year.
 
IONIS-JBI1-2.5Rx – IONIS-JBI1-2.5Rx is a Generation 2.5 antisense medicine we designed to treat people for an undisclosed target of gastrointestinal autoimmune disease. In December 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Janssen to discover and develop antisense drugs that can be locally administered, including oral delivery, to treat autoimmune disorders of the GI tract. In July 2016, Janssen licensed IONIS-JBI1-2.5Rx from us. Janssen is currently conducting a Phase 1 study of IONIS-JBI1-2.5Rx.
 
Preclinical Medicines in Development
 
The efficiency and broad applicability of our technology enables us to develop medicines for a broad range of diseases. On average, it takes 12 to 18 months to complete the preclinical studies necessary to support clinical development. Over the last year we added eight new medicines to our preclinical pipeline.

 Antisense Technology
 
Our antisense technology is an innovative platform for discovering first-in-class and/or best-in-class medicines for treating disease. We believe this technology represents an important advance in the way we treat disease. Unlike most other drug technologies that work by affecting existing proteins in the body, antisense medicines target RNA, the intermediary that conveys genetic information from a gene to the protein synthesis machinery in the cell. By targeting RNA instead of proteins, we can use antisense technology to increase, decrease or alter the production of specific proteins. The unique properties of antisense technology provide several advantages over traditional drug discovery technologies.
 
 18
 
These advantages include:
 
  
● | Direct intervention in the disease process at the genetic level by targeting RNA: antisense technology represents a direct route from gene to drug. The explosion in genomic information and RNA biology has led to the discovery of many new disease-causing proteins and RNAs and has created new opportunities that are only accessible to antisense technology. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Precise specificity: we design antisense medicines to target a single RNA, which minimizes or eliminates the possibility our medicines will bind to unintended targets which can cause unwanted side effects. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Good drug properties: antisense medicines distribute well throughout the body without the need for special formulations or vehicles. They also have a relatively long half-life of approximately two to four weeks in most tissues outside of the brain and spinal cord and three to four months in brain and spinal cord, which means patients and/or healthcare providers can dose our medicines weekly, monthly or even less frequently depending on the medicine and target tissue. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability to combine with other drugs: because antisense medicines do not interact with the enzymes that metabolize or break down other drugs, physicians can use our medicines in combination with other drugs. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broad applications to multiple disease targets, multiple tissues and multiple mechanisms: there are virtually no “undruggable” targets with antisense technology. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilize many different routes of administration including subcutaneous, intravenous, intrathecal, intravitreal, pulmonary and oral.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Efficient discovery and early development: because of the efficiency of our antisense technology, our drug discovery and early development costs and success rates compare favorably to small molecule or antibody drug discovery and development. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We develop antisense medicines to potentially treat a wide range of diseases in a number of different therapeutic areas from severe and rare diseases to diseases that affect large patient populations. We focus our efforts on diseases in which there is a large unmet medical need with limited or no current treatments or in diseases for which we believe our medicines have a competitive advantage over existing therapies.
 
Technology Overview
 
We use our core technology platform to discover and develop medicines that affect targets in the body at the genetic level. Genes contain the information necessary to produce proteins. A gene is made up of nucleotides containing the nucleoside bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, commonly known as A, T, G and C, which are linked together to form a two-stranded structure that resembles a twisted ladder, known as deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. The nucleotides on one side of the ladder bind weakly to complementary nucleotides on the other strand according to specific rules; for example, A pairs with T and G pairs with C, creating the ladder’s rungs (Figure 1). Scientists call this highly specific nucleotide pairing hybridization. The sequence or order of these nucleotides establishes the cell’s recipes for making proteins. Each protein’s instructions reside in a corresponding segment of DNA known as a gene.
 
 19
 
Figure 1: Illustration of DNA.
 
The instructions for making a protein are transcribed from a gene, or DNA into a different genetic molecule called messenger RNA. This process starts with the partial uncoiling of the two complementary strands of the DNA. One strand acts as a template and information stored in the DNA template strand is copied into a complementary RNA (Figure 2) by an enzyme called RNA polymerase, or RNAP. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, are mature, fully processed RNA that code for proteins.
 
   Figure 2: Transcription of information contained in a gene, or DNA, to RNA.
 
Ribosomes, the cell’s factories for manufacturing proteins, translate mRNA into proteins. The ribosome reads the encoded information, the mRNA’s nucleotide sequence, and in doing so, strings together amino acids to form a specific protein (Figure 3).
 
 20
 
Figure 3: Translation of the protein-coding information contained in mRNA to protein.
 
We primarily use our antisense technology to interrupt the cell’s protein production process by preventing the mRNA instructions from reaching the ribosome, thus inhibiting the production of the protein. We can also design antisense medicines to increase protein production for diseases caused by the lack of a particular protein or modify the processing (or splicing) of the mRNA, which can alter the composition of the protein. The mRNA sequence of nucleotides that carries the information for protein production is called the ‘sense’ strand. Scientists call the complementary nucleotide chain that binds specifically to the sense strand the “antisense” strand. We use the information contained in mRNA to design chemical structures, that we call antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs, or antisense medicines, which resemble DNA and RNA and are the complement of RNA. Our antisense medicines bind with high selectivity to the mRNA they were designed to target. Since each mRNA codes for a specific protein, this selectivity provides a level of specificity that is better than traditional drugs. As a result, we can design antisense medicines that selectively inhibit the disease-causing member of a protein family without interfering with other members of the protein family that might be necessary for normal cellular or bodily functions. This unique specificity means that antisense medicines may be less toxic than traditional drugs because we can design them to minimize the impact on unintended targets.
 
We have developed the majority of the medicines in our pipeline using our advanced screens to produce medicines with what we believe have the best possible safety and tolerability profiles. We refer to our medicines that have passed these advanced screens as Generation 2+ medicines. We continue to advance our antisense technology to create even more potent medicines that we can use in more tissues and against more targets. These advances allow us to expand the mechanisms through which we can use our medicines. These advancements provide us with greater opportunities to use our antisense medicines to treat a greater number of diseases and reach more patient populations. Today several of our early stage medicines and those entering our pipeline use our most advanced antisense technology, including our next generation chemistries, Generation 2.5, and our LICA technology.
 
Generation 2.5 chemistry is an advancement that we have demonstrated increases the potency of our medicines by up to 10-fold over our Generation 2+ medicines. This increase in potency enables our medicines to engage targets in a broader array of tissues. We have published data demonstrating that our Generation 2.5 medicines generally have enhanced potency over our Generation 2+ medicines and are broadly distributed throughout the body to multiple tissues including liver, kidney, lung, muscle, adipose, adrenal gland, peripheral nerves and tumor tissues. Our Generation 2.5 medicines constitute some of our recently added new medicines to our pipeline.
 
LICA is a chemical technology we developed that involves attaching a molecule called a ligand that binds with receptors on the surfaces of cells in a highly specific manner. Because these receptors are often found only on certain cell types, LICA allows us to increase effective delivery of our antisense medicines with higher specificity to certain cell types that express these receptors relative to non-conjugated antisense medicines. In November 2018, we published an integrated assessment of data from over 600 subjects, with more than 200 subjects on treatment for six months or longer, available from randomized placebo-controlled dose-ranging studies. The integrated assessment demonstrated with multiple Generation 2+ LICA medicines that our LICA technology for liver targets can increase potency by up to more than 30-fold over our non-LICA Generation 2+ medicines. In addition to the increase in potency, a favorable safety and tolerability profile was observed and was consistent across the entire LICA platform. There were no safety concerns related to platelets, liver or kidney function.
 
 21
 
AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx further exemplifies these improvements. We designed this medicine to reduce the production of apolipoprotein(a), or Apo(a), protein in the liver to offer a direct approach for reducing lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). The Phase 2 AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx study was the first and only medicine to selectively and robustly reduce Lp(a) levels below threshold levels associated with CVD in nearly all patients. This study included more than 280 patients, with 98 percent of patients in the high dose group achieving levels below 50 mg/dL, the recognized risk threshold for CVD. Like the integrated assessment, the safety and tolerability profile from this study was favorable and there were no safety concerns related to platelets, liver or kidney function.
 
We have also combined our LICA technology with our Generation 2.5 chemistry medicines to further increase potency. Although we designed our first LICA medicines to inhibit targets in the liver, we are also developing LICA conjugation technology that we can use to target other tissues, such as the pancreas, and the initial results are promising.
 
Antisense Targets and Mechanisms
 
There are more than a dozen different antisense mechanisms that we can exploit with our antisense technology. The majority of the medicines in our pipeline bind to mRNAs and inhibit the production of disease-causing proteins. However, our antisense technology is broadly applicable to many different antisense mechanisms, including modulation of RNA splicing, RNA interference, or RNAi, and enhancing protein translation to increase protein production. In May 2018, we published research showing that we can use our proprietary oligonucleotide technology with CRISPR/Cas9, a gene editing system that uses RNA to activate, target and edit specific sites on DNA. Our work in this area provides an important step toward developing potential therapeutic applications for CRISPR technology.
 
 When using antisense technology to inhibit the production of disease-causing proteins or reduce levels of harmful RNAs, our antisense medicines bind to the target RNA via highly specific nucleotide pairing, or hybridization, and recruit a cellular enzyme called ribonuclease H1, or RNase H1, to degrade the target RNA. The antisense medicine itself remains intact during this process, so it can remain active against additional target RNA molecules and repeatedly trigger their degradation (Figure 4). Examples of our antisense medicines that use the RNase H1 mechanism to reduce disease protein production include, WAYLIVRA, TEGSEDI, IONIS-FXIRx, IONIS-FXI-LRx, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, IONIS-HTTRx, and others.
 
Figure 4: Antisense medicine using the RNase H mechanism of action.
 
SPINRAZA is an example of an antisense medicine that modulates RNA splicing to increase protein production of the SMN protein (Figure 5), which is critical to the health and survival of nerve cells in the spinal cord that are responsible for neuro-muscular function. The SMN protein is deficient in people with SMA. There are a number of other diseases, including cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which may be treated by modulating splicing using antisense technology.
 
 22
 
Figure 5: Antisense medicine altering splicing of the SMN2 mRNA.
 
Another class of RNA targets for our antisense technology are microRNAs. To date, scientists have identified more than 700 microRNAs in the human genome, and have shown that the absence or presence of specific microRNAs in various cells is associated with specific human diseases, including cancer, viral infection, metabolic disorders and inflammatory disease. To fully exploit the therapeutic opportunities of targeting microRNAs, we co-founded Regulus Therapeutics as a company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of microRNA-based therapeutics.
    We are also making progress in designing antisense medicines to target long, non-coding RNAs, or lncRNAs and RNAs that possess a toxic function in human diseases. Many of these RNAs, such as lncRNAs, do not make proteins but often cause disease by regulating the function of other genes or proteins. In 2014, we published a paper in Nature in which we were the first to show that targeted reduction of a lncRNA with an antisense compound can ameliorate certain cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome, or AS. Moreover, these studies demonstrate the potential therapeutic benefits of antisense medicines for the treatment of AS.
 
Because the efficiency of our core technology platform can support multiple target-based antisense research programs without significantly increasing costs, we can develop antisense medicines to target a broad range of diseases, efficiently producing a large and broad proprietary portfolio of medicines. We are currently pursuing antisense drug discovery programs focused on various severe and rare diseases, cardiometabolic diseases, neurologic diseases, cancer and other diseases.
 
 Collaborative Arrangements and Licensing Agreements
  
Partnering Strategy

 
We have established alliances with a cadre of leading global pharmaceutical companies that are working alongside us in developing our medicines, advancing our technology, preparing to commercialize our medicines and selling our medicines. Our partners include the following companies, among others: AstraZeneca, Bayer, Biogen, GSK, Janssen, Novartis and Roche. Our partners bring resources and expertise that augment and build upon our internal capabilities. The depth of our knowledge and expertise with antisense technology together with our strong financial position provides us the flexibility to partner our medicines at what we believe is the optimal time to maximize the near-term, mid-term and long-term value of our medicines. We have distinct partnering strategies that we employ based on the specific program, therapeutic area and the expertise and resources our potential partners may bring to the collaboration.

● | We have a strategic partnership with Biogen, which we expanded in 2018. Biogen provides expertise, tools and resources to complement our drug discovery efforts. Our broad strategic alliance with Biogen pairs Biogen’s extensive resources and expertise in neurodegenerative diseases with our antisense technology. Together we are creating a franchise of novel medicines for neurodegenerative diseases that has the potential to expand both our pipeline and Biogen’s pipeline with promising new medicines. Our development of and Biogen’s commercialization of SPINRAZA, is just one example of the power of our strategic partnership. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have partnerships with companies that bring significant expertise and global resources to develop and potentially commercialize medicines for a particular therapeutic area. For example, in January 2017, we initiated a collaboration with Novartis to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. In February 2019, Novartis licensed AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and we earned a $150 million license fee. Novartis is responsible for conducting and funding all future development and commercialization activities for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, including a global pivotal cardiovascular outcomes study, for which planning and initiation activities are underway. We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that should accelerate our ability to deliver these medicines to large patient populations who have high cardiovascular risk due to inadequately treated lipid disorders.

 For additional details about our collaboration agreements with Roche, including other financial information and termination provisions, see Note 6, Collaborative Arrangements and Licensing Agreements, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 
Akcea Collaborations
 
The following collaboration agreements relate to Akcea, our majority-owned affiliate. Our consolidated results include all the revenue earned and cash received under these collaboration agreements. We reflect the noncontrolling interest attributable to other owners of Akcea’s common stock in a separate line on our statement of operations and in a separate line within stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet.
Novartis


In January 2017, we and Akcea initiated a collaboration with Novartis to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. Under the collaboration agreement, Novartis has an exclusive option to further develop and commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. Akcea is responsible for completing a Phase 2 program, conducting an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and providing initial quantities of API for each medicine. If Novartis exercises an option for either of these medicines, Novartis will be responsible for all further global development, regulatory and co-commercialization activities and costs for such medicine.
 
Akcea received a $75 million upfront payment in the first quarter of 2017. In February 2019, Novartis licensed AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and we earned a $150 million license fee. Novartis is responsible for conducting and funding all future development, regulatory and commercialization activities for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, including a global pivotal cardiovascular outcomes study, for which planning and initiation activities are underway. If Novartis exercises its option for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, Novartis will pay Akcea a license fee equal to $150 million. In addition, Akcea is eligible to receive up to $675 million and $530 million in milestone payments related to AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, respectively. Akcea is also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the mid-teens to low 20 percent range on net sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. Akcea will pay 50 percent of these license fees, milestone payments and royalties to us as a sublicense fee. In connection with Novartis’ license of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, Akcea and Novartis established a more definitive framework under which the companies would negotiate the co-commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in selected markets. Included in this framework is an option by which Novartis could solely commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in exchange for Novartis paying Akcea increased commercial milestone payments based on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. Akcea may co-commercialize IONIS-APOCIII-LRx if licensed and commercialized by Novartis in selected markets through its specialized sales force under terms and conditions to be negotiated with Novartis in the future.
 
In conjunction with this collaboration, we entered into a SPA with Novartis. As part of the SPA, Novartis purchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $100 million in the first quarter of 2017 and purchased $50 million of Akcea’s common stock at the IPO price concurrent with the IPO in July 2017.

Consistent with the agreements between Ionis and Akcea, the companies will share all payments, including royalties.
  
 Satellite Company Partnerships

 
We have a number of satellite company collaborations that expand the reach and potential of our RNA-targeting medicines into disease areas that are outside of our core focus.
 
For example, we have a collaboration with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics. Under the terms of the agreement, we exclusively licensed to Alnylam our patent estate relating to antisense motifs and mechanisms and oligonucleotide chemistry for double-stranded RNAi therapeutics in exchange for a technology access fee, participation in fees from Alnylam’s partnering programs, as well as future milestone and royalty payments from Alnylam. We also have the potential to earn a portion of payments that Alnylam receives from licenses of our technology it grants to its partners, plus royalties. We retained rights to a limited number of double-stranded RNAi therapeutic targets and all rights to single-stranded RNAi, or ssRNAi, therapeutics. In turn, Alnylam nonexclusively licensed to us its patent estate relating to antisense motifs and mechanisms and oligonucleotide chemistry to research, develop and commercialize single-stranded antisense therapeutics, ssRNAi therapeutics, and to research double-stranded RNAi compounds. We also received a license to develop and commercialize double-stranded RNAi drugs targeting a limited number of therapeutic targets on a nonexclusive basis. Additionally, In 2015, we and Alnylam entered into an alliance in which we cross-licensed intellectual property. Under this alliance, we and Alnylam each obtained exclusive license rights to four therapeutic programs. Alnylam granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to its chemistry, RNA targeting mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotides against four targets, including FXI and Apo(a) and two other targets. In exchange, we granted Alnylam an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to our chemistry, RNA targeting mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotides against four other targets. Alnylam also granted us a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license to new platform technology arising from May 2014 through April 2019 for single-stranded antisense therapeutics. In turn, we granted Alnylam a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license to new platform technology arising from May 2014 through April 2019 for double-stranded RNAi therapeutics.
 
In addition to Alnylam, our satellite company collaborations include collaborations with the following companies:

Manufacturing
    We have dedicated significant resources to develop ways to improve manufacturing efficiency and capacity. Since we can use variants of the same nucleotide building blocks and the same type of equipment to produce our oligonucleotide medicines, we found that the same techniques we used to efficiently manufacture one oligonucleotide medicine could help improve the manufacturing processes for many other oligonucleotide medicines. By developing several proprietary chemical processes to scale up our manufacturing capabilities, we have greatly reduced the cost of producing oligonucleotide medicines. For example, we have significantly reduced the cost of raw materials through improved yield efficiency, while at the same time increasing our capacity to make the medicines. Through both our internal research and development programs and collaborations with outside vendors we may achieve even greater efficiency and further cost reductions.
    Our drug substance manufacturing facility is located in a 28,700 square foot building in Carlsbad, California. We purchased this building in 2017. In addition, we have a 25,800 square foot building that houses support functions for our manufacturing activities. We lease this facility under a lease that has an initial term ending in June 2021 with an option to extend the lease for up to two additional five-year periods. Our manufacturing facility is subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and foreign equivalents to ensure that it is operating in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements.
 
As part of our collaborations we may agree to manufacture clinical trial materials and/or commercial supply for our partners. For example, in the past we have manufactured clinical supply materials for AstraZeneca, Bayer, Biogen, GSK and Novartis.
    We believe we have sufficient manufacturing capacity at our own facility or at contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to meet our current internal research, development and potential commercial needs, as well as our current and future obligations under existing agreements with our partners for research, development and commercial needs. We believe our current network of CMO partners are capable of providing sufficient quantities to meet anticipated commercial demands. Additionally, we continue to evaluate relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity and diversify our supply chain. While we believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our commercial requirements, we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. We also cannot provide assurance that we will not experience a disruption in supply from our current CMO partners.
 
CMOs are subject to the FDA’s cGMP requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our CMO partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.
 
Specifically, we have the following in place for our approved medicines, SPINRAZA and TEGSEDI, our medicine currently under regulatory review, WAYLIVRA and our medicine in Phase 3 development, IONIS-HTTRx:
 
SPINRAZA
 
Pursuant to our collaboration with Biogen, Biogen is responsible for SPINRAZA drug supply. We provided Biogen with API for SPINRAZA in 2018 under our manufacturing agreement with Biogen, which ended in September 2018. Biogen has an oligonucleotide synthesis manufacturing facility that gives it the capability to manufacture SPINRAZA.
TEGSEDI
 
For TEGSEDI’s commercial drug supply, we are using CMOs to produce custom raw materials, API and finished goods. Our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise and cGMP experience.
WAYLIVRA
 
We have supplied Akcea either through our manufacturing processes or through our outside vendors, with API and finished drug product to complete Akcea’s ongoing clinical study for WAYLIVRA. We have also supplied the API and the finished drug product for WAYLIVRA’s commercial launch. We believe we have sufficient API and drug product for at least the first two years of WAYLIVRA’s commercial launch. Akcea plans to leverage our relationships with CMOs to procure its own long-term raw material and drug supplies at competitive prices in the future.
IONIS-HTTRX
 
Pursuant to our collaboration with Roche, Roche is responsible for IONIS-HTTRx drug supply.
 
LICA Medicines
 
We have manufactured limited supplies of our LICA medicines for our preclinical and clinical studies. We have also used CMOs to manufacture our LICA medicines. LICA enables lower doses than unconjugated oligonucleotides. With our expertise in optimizing manufacturing of oligonucleotides, we believe we can develop new processes to scale up manufacturing of our LICA medicines at commercially competitive prices.

Patents and Proprietary Rights
    Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products in the U.S. and other countries. We own or have exclusively licensed a substantial patent estate with numerous issued patents worldwide protecting our products and, more generally, our platform for development and commercialization of oligonucleotide therapeutics. We focus our resources on patents and new patent applications that drive value for our company.
    We own or control patents that provide exclusivity for products in our pipeline and patents that provide exclusivity for our core technology in the field of antisense more generally. Our core technology patents include claims to chemically modified nucleosides and oligonucleotides as well as antisense drug designs utilizing these chemically modified nucleosides. These core claims are each independent of specific therapeutic target, nucleic acid sequence, or clinical indication. We also own a large number of patents claiming antisense compounds having nucleic acid sequences complementary to therapeutic target nucleic acids, independent of the particular chemical modifications incorporated into the antisense compound. Most importantly, we seek and obtain issued patent claims to specifically protect each of our medicines. For example, we file and seek to obtain claims covering each drug’s nucleic acid sequence and precise drug design. In sum, we maintain our competitive advantage in the field of antisense technology by protecting our core platform technology and by creating multiple layers of patent protection for each of our specific medicines in development.
 

Type of Patent Claim (Broadly Applicable to Specific) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● Chemically Modified Nucleosides and Oligonucleotides (target and sequence independent) ● Antisense Drug Design Motifs (target and sequence independent) ● Therapeutic Methods (sequence and chemistry independent) ● Antisense Sequence (chemistry independent) ● Drug Composition

Chemically Modified Nucleosides and Oligonucleotides
    The most broadly applicable of our patents are those that claim modified nucleosides and oligonucleotides comprising the modified nucleosides that we incorporate into our antisense medicines to increase their therapeutic efficacy. Nucleosides and chemically modified nucleosides are the basic building blocks of our antisense medicines, therefore claims that cover any oligonucleotide incorporating one of our proprietary modified nucleosides can apply to a wide array of antisense mechanisms of action as well as several therapeutic targets. Of particular note are our patents covering our proprietary 2’-O-(2-methoxy) ethyl, or “MOE,” modified nucleosides, incorporated into many of our second generation development compounds, as well as our constrained-ethyl nucleosides, or “cEt” nucleosides incorporated into our Generation 2.5 compounds.
 
The following are some of our patents in this category in key jurisdictions (U.S., Europe and Japan):
    
Jurisdiction | Patent No. | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims 
--------------+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
United States | 7,101,993 | OLIGONUCLEOTIDES CONTAINING 2’O-MODIFIED PURINES | 2023 | Covers certain MOE nucleosides and oligonucleotides containing these nucleotides.

Antisense Drug Design Motifs
    We also have patents that claim oligonucleotides comprising antisense drug design motifs, or patterns of nucleoside modifications at specified positions in the oligonucleotide. Patent claims covering our antisense drug design motifs are independent of nucleic acid sequence, so they cover oligonucleotides having the recited motif, regardless of cellular target or clinical indication. The claimed motifs generally confer properties that optimize oligonucleotides for a particular antisense mechanism of action, such as ribonuclease H, or RNase H, RNAi, or splicing. We have designed oligonucleotides incorporating motifs, which we refer to as chimeric compounds or gapmers, to exploit the RNase H mechanism to achieve target RNA reduction. Almost all of our medicines, including TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA and IONIS-HTTRx, but excluding SPINRAZA, contain this gapmer antisense drug design motif. We own a U.S. patent that covers all of our second generation MOE gapmer antisense medicines until March of 2023.
 
In addition, we have pursued patent claims to antisense drug design motifs incorporating bicyclic nucleoside analogs, which include both locked nucleic acids, or “LNA” and cEt. In Europe, we have been granted claims drawn to certain short gapmer oligonucleotides with bicyclic nucleosides, which include locked nucleic acids, in the wings for the treatment of cardiovascular or metabolic disorders. We have also successfully obtained issued patent claims covering our Generation 2.5 gapmer antisense drug design motifs that incorporate our cEt modified nucleosides. Santaris opposed granted European patents EP2092065 and EP2410053. In April 2015, the claims of EP2092065 were successfully upheld in amended form and in January 2017, EP2410053 was upheld with only a minor amendment. The following patents are some examples of our issued patents in this category in key jurisdictions:
 

Jurisdiction | Patent/ Application No. | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims

Japan | JP 5665317 | ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS | 2027 | Gapmer compounds having wings comprised of 2’-MOE and bicyclic nucleosides 
Europe | EP2673361 | OLIGOMERIC COMPOUNDS COMPRISING BICYCLIC NUCLEOTIDES AND USES THEREOF | 2032 | Gapmer having at least one bicyclic nucleoside, 2’-modified nucleoside, and 2’-deoxynucleoside in either the 5’- or 3’-wing. 

 
LIgand-Conjugated Antisense (LICA) Technology
 
We have also pursued patent claims to new chemistries created to enhance targeting of antisense medicines to specific tissues and cells to improve a drug’s properties. We designed our N-acetyl-galactosamine, or GalNAc, LICA medicines to provide an increase in potency for targets in the liver. We have successfully obtained issued patent claims covering our LICA technology conjugated to any modified oligonucleotide, including gapmers, double-stranded siRNA compounds, and fully modified oligonucleotides. The following patents are some examples of our issued patents in this category:
 

Jurisdiction | Patent/ Application No. | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims 
--------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
United States | 9,127,276 | CONJUGATED ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE | 2034 | Covers our primary THA LICA conjugated to any group of nucleosides, including gapmers, double-stranded siRNA compounds, and fully modified oligonucleotides 
United States | 9,181,549 | CONJUGATED ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE | 2034 | Covers our primary THA conjugate having our preferred linker and cleavable moiety conjugated to any oligomeric compound or any nucleoside having a 2’-MOE modification or a cEt modification 

Therapeutic Methods of Treatment and Antisense Drug Sequences
    In addition to our broad core patents, we also own hundreds of patents, worldwide, with claims to antisense compounds having particular sequences and compounds directed to particular therapeutically important targets or methods of achieving clinical endpoints using these antisense compounds. These “Target” patents also include claims reciting the specific nucleic acid sequences utilized by our products, independent of chemical modifications and motifs. In addition, our product specific patents typically include claims combining specific nucleic acid sequences with nucleoside modifications and motifs. In this way, we seek patent claims narrowly tailored to protect our product’s specifically, in addition to the broader core antisense patents described above.

IONIS-HTTRx and Huntingtin
    We obtained issued claims covering IONIS-HTTRx in the U.S.. The issued U.S. claims protect IONIS-HTTRx from generic competition in the U.S. until at least 2030. We are also pursuing additional patent applications designed to protect IONIS-HTTRx in foreign jurisdictions.

We seek patent protection in significant markets and/or countries for each medicine in development. We also seek to maximize patent term. In some cases, the patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during FDA regulatory review. The patent exclusivity period for a medicine will prevent generic medicines from entering the market. Patent exclusivity depends on a number of factors including initial patent term and available patent term extensions based upon delays caused by the regulatory approval process.
 
 33
 
Manufacturing Patents
    We also own patents claiming methods of manufacturing and purifying oligonucleotides. These patents claim methods for improving oligonucleotide drug manufacturing, including processes for large-scale oligonucleotide synthesis and purification. These methods allow us to manufacture oligonucleotides at lower cost by, for example, eliminating expensive manufacturing steps.
    We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in antisense therapeutics.
 
 Government Regulation
    Regulation by government authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant component in the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and services. In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and relevant foreign regulatory authorities, we are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state and local regulations.
    Extensive regulation by the U.S. and foreign governmental authorities governs the development, manufacture and sale of our medicines. In particular, our medicines are subject to a number of approval requirements by the FDA in the U.S. under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other laws and by comparable agencies in those foreign countries in which we conduct business. The FDCA and other various federal, state and foreign statutes govern or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, quality, and import and export of our medicines. State, local, and other authorities also regulate pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities and procedures.
     Our manufacturing facility and our CMOs are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other foreign equivalents to ensure that they are operating in compliance with cGMP requirements. In addition, marketing authorization for each new medicine may require a rigorous manufacturing pre-approval inspection by regulatory authorities. Post approval, there are strict regulations regarding changes to the manufacturing process, and, depending on the significance of the change, changes may require prior FDA approval. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use.
    The FDA must approve any new medicine before a manufacturer can market it in the U.S.. In order to obtain approval, we and our partners must complete clinical studies and prepare and submit an NDA to the FDA. If the FDA approves a medicine, it will issue an approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the medicine and may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure the benefits of the medicine outweigh the potential risks. For example, TEGSEDI has a REMS program. The requirements for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of our medicines. In foreign jurisdictions, the drug approval process is similarly demanding.
 
Numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and similar foreign, state and local government authorities, regulate sales, promotion and other activities following drug approval. Only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that the FDA has approved may be used in labeling. We are only allowed to use promotional communications regarding a drug that are consistent with the information in the drug’s approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.
 
For any approved medicine, domestic and foreign sales of the medicine depend, in part, on the availability and amount of reimbursement by third party payors, including governments and private health plans. Private health plans may seek to manage cost and use of our medicines by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. Governments may also regulate or influence coverage, reimbursement and/or pricing of our medicines to control cost or affect use. Within the EU a variety of payors pay for medicines, with governments being the primary source of payment. Negotiating pricing with governmental authorities can delay commercialization. Such pricing and reimbursement factors could impact our ability, including Akcea, and that of our commercial partners to successfully commercialize approved medicines.
 
In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels and by foreign governments that seek to reduce healthcare costs. There has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in efforts to bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medicines.
 
Other healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; analogous foreign and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, in California, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect; and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of medicines, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 
 34
 
Our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, distributors, or other business partners, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. These laws may impact, among other things, our, Akcea’s, and our partners’ proposed sales, marketing and education programs.
 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits certain individuals and entities, including us, from promising, paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, directly or indirectly, to obtain or retain business or an improper advantage. If we violate the FCPA, it could result in large civil and criminal penalties as well as an adverse effect on our reputation, operations, and financial condition. We could also face collateral consequences such as debarment and the loss of export privileges.
 
 Competition
 
Our Business in General
    Some of our medicines may compete with existing therapies for market share. In addition, there are a number of companies pursuing the development of oligonucleotide-based technologies and the development of pharmaceuticals utilizing these technologies. These companies include specialized pharmaceutical firms and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together with biopharmaceutical companies. Our medicines are differentiated from traditional small molecule medicines by their chemistry, how they move in the body, how they act in the body, delivery technology, and formulations.
 
Our approved products and our products under development address numerous markets. The diseases our medicines target for which we have or may receive marketing authorization will determine our competition. For some of our products, an important factor may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical trials and marketing authorization processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market are important competitive factors. We expect to compete among products approved for sale based on a variety of factors, including, among other things, product efficacy, safety, mechanism of action, dosing convenience, marketing and sales strategy and tactics, availability, price, and reimbursement.
 
Below we have included what we believe to be the competitive landscape for the following key programs:
 
  
● | Marketed Medicines: SPINRAZA and TEGSEDI

● | Medicine under regulatory review: WAYLIVRA
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Medicine currently in pivotal trials: IONIS-HTTRx

Marketed Medicines
 
SPINRAZA
 
We believe that the following medicines could compete with SPINRAZA:
 

Medicine | Company | Medicine Description | Phase | Admin/Dosing | Efficacy(1) | Safety(1) 
---------------------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zolgensma (AVXS-101) | Novartis | Gene therapy that corrects the SMN1 gene using the AAV9 Vector | Under FDA Review | Infusion | Demonstrated an increase in survival and improvement in achievement of developmental milestones vs the natural history of SMA Type 1.

We believe that Zolgensma, if approved, may be the first medicine to compete with SPINRAZA. The FDA accepted Novartis’ biologics licensing application, or BLA, for Zolgensma, in December 2018 and regulatory action is anticipated in May 2019. The filing is supported by data from the START trial, which demonstrated an increase in survival and improvement in achievement of developmental milestones compared to the natural history of SMA Type 1. The START trial included 15 patients.
 
TEGSEDI
 
We believe that the following medicines could compete with TEGSEDI:
 

Medicine | Company | Medicine Description | Phase | Admin/Dosing | Efficacy(1) | Safety(1) 
-----------+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Onpattro | Alnylam | An RNAi drug formulated with lipid nanoparticles to inhibit TTR mRNA | Approved | Infusion every 3 weeks with pre-treatment with steroids | 84.3% mean reduction in TTR at 18 months | Most common AEs more frequently observed in Onpattro arm vs. placebo were peripheral edema (29.7% vs. 22.1%) and infusion-related reactions (18.9% vs. 9.1%)
Tafamidis | Pfizer | A small molecule drug to stabilize TTR Protein | Commercially available in the EU for stage 1 hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Under review in the U.S. for ATTR with cariodmyopathy with a PDUFA date in July 2019 | Daily oral capsule | In 45% of patients taking Tafamidis, nerve function either improved or stabilized, compared with 30% of patients taking placebo | Urinary tract infection, vaginal infection, upper abdominal pain and diarrhea 
AG10 | Eidos | Small molecule that binds and stabilizes TTR in the blood | 2 | Oral | Demonstrated a statistically significant increase in serum TTR concentrations | Drug well tolerated with no safety signals 
CRX-1008 | Corino Therapeutics | Small molecule repurposed generic drug | 2 | Daily oral dose | Shows binding and stabilization of TTR in humans | No drug related adverse events reported 
Vutrisiran | Alnylam | An RNAi drug conjugated with GalNAC to inhibit TTR mRNA in liver cells | 3 | Monthly or quarterly | In healthy volunteers, a single dose showed mean max TTR knockdown of 97% | Injection site reactions were reported 


(1) | Taken from public documents including respective company press releases, company presentations, and scientific presentations. Diflunisal efficacy and safety came from the published papers of two investigator sponsored studies, Berk JL, Suhr OB, Obici L, et al. Repurposing Diflunisal for Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy: A Randomized Clinical Trial. JAMA. 2013;310(24):2658-2667 and Sekijima YS, Toja K, Morita H, et al. Safety and efficacy of long-term diflunisal administration in hereditary transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. Amyloid. 2015;22(2):79-83. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



TEGSEDI is a once weekly, self-administered subcutaneous medicine. TEGSEDI was approved in 2018 in the U.S., EU and Canada for the treatment of polyneuropathy caused by hATTR in adult patients. Results from our Phase 3 NEURO-TTR study demonstrated that patients treated with TEGSEDI experienced significant benefit compared to patients treated with placebo across both co-primary endpoints: the Norfolk QoL-DN and mNIS+7 a measure of neuropathic disease progression. The product label for TEGSEDI in the U.S. has a boxed warning for thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis and requires periodic blood and urine monitoring. TEGSEDI has a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program. Our main competition in the U.S. market for TEGSEDI is ONPATTRO (patisiran), marketed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Although ONPATTRO requires intravenous administration by a healthcare provider in a clinical setting every three weeks and pre-treatment with steroids, it does not have a boxed warning or REMS.
 
Medicine Under Regulatory Review
 
 36
 
WAYLIVRA
 
We believe that the following medicines could compete with WAYLIVRA:
 

Medicine | Company | Medicine Description | Phase | Admin/Dosing | Efficacy(1) | Safety(1) 
------------+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+-------+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Metreleptin | Novelion Therapeutics | A synthetic form of the hormone leptin | 3 | Reconstituted subcutaneous injection | 44.4% mean reduction in triglycerides at four months in patients with abnormal triglyceride levels | Anti-metreleptin antibodies, hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity, risk of T-cell lymphoma 
Gemcabene | Gemphire Therapeutics | Monocalcium salt of a dialkyl ether dicarboxylic acid | 2 | Oral, once-daily | In a post hoc analysis (n=9) of patients with triglycerides >500 mg/dL, reductions of 59% and 60% from 150 mg and 300 mg doses, respectively, were observed | In a recent study, in the gemcabene-treatment group, the most frequently occurring adverse events were headache and infection


(1) | Taken from public documents including respective company press releases, company presentations, and scientific presentations.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Metreleptin is being tested in people with FPL who also have NASH. Metreleptin is currently approved for use in the U.S. and EU in generalized lipodystrophy, or GL patients. Metreleptin does not affect apoC-III levels. ApoC-III levels have been shown to be elevated in people with FPL, and directly correlate to triglyceride levels.
 
Gemcabene is being studied in people with severe hypertriglyceridemia, defined as triglycerides above 500 mg/dL. Gemphire announced top-line results in June 2018 that Gemcabene met its Phase 2b primary endpoint and demonstrated statistically significant lowering of triglycerides in severe hypertriglyceridemia. The initiation of a Phase 3 study will not take place until the partial clinical hold, which was issued by the FDA in 2004, is lifted.
 
To date, WAYLIVRA has shown the highest percent of triglyceride reductions compared to existing treatments, such as fibrates, regardless of starting triglyceride levels prior to dosing with WAYLIVRA. Based on our broad Phase 2 data for the treatment of different patients including people with FCS, we believe that WAYLIVRA will work equally well as a single agent or in combination with other triglyceride-lowering medicines on the market. If regulatory authorities require us to implement platelet monitoring procedures in the commercial setting, which have yet to be determined, it could impact the future competitive profile of WAYLIVRA.
 
Medicine Currently in Pivotal Trials
 
IONIS-HTTRx
 
We believe that the following medicines could compete with IONIS-HTTRx:
 

Medicine | Company | Medicine Description | Phase | Admin/Dosing | Efficacy(1) | Safety(1) 
-----------------------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+-------+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------
Laquinimod | Active Biotech | A small molecule that activates selective aryl hydrocarbon receptor | 2 | Daily oral dose | Did not meet its primary endpoint of slowing disease development, but secondary endpoint of reduction of brain atrophy was met | No drug related adverse events reported 
OMS824 | Omeros | A small molecule that targets PDE 10 | 2 | Daily oral dose | None reported | None reported 
Selistat | AOP Orphan | An orally active, selective SIRT1 inhibitor | 2 | Daily oral dose | None reported | Safe and tolerable in Phase 1 and Phase 2 study 
VX15 | Vaccinex | A monoclonal antibody that blocks the activity of SEMA4D | 2 | Monthly intravenous infusions | Favored in all brain regions examined, with median increase in FDG uptake from baseline of 8.6% vs placebo control achieving significance in the majority of frontal and parietal brain regions analyzed | To date, evaluated patients showed no safety signals
WVE-120101/ WVE-120102 | Wave Life Sciences | Antisense drugs targeting mHTT SNP-1 and SNP-2 | 1b/2a | Intrathecal administration | None reported | None reported 


(1) | Taken from public documents including respective company press releases, company presentations, and scientific presentations.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 37
 
We believe that Wave Life Sciences’ WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, being developed for Huntington’s Disease, could compete directly against IONIS-HTTRx. These medicines are antisense medicines administered intrathecally, targeting mHTT SNP-1 and SNP-2, respectively. Wave Life Sciences is currently conducting two simultaneous Phase 1b/2a clinical trials, enrolling adults with early manifest Huntington’s disease who carry a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, at the SNP1 (study name: PRECISION HD1) and SNP2 (study name: PRECISION HD2) location, with their data readouts expected in the first half of 2019.
