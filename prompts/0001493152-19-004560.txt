Company Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on creating value through (i) the streamlined development under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA of our lead product candidate, MAT9001, a highly purified, prescription-only omega-3 free fatty acid formulation specifically designed for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic conditions and (ii) the application of our lipid nano-crystal (LNC) platform delivery technology to solve complex challenges relating to the delivery of small molecules, gene therapies, vaccines, proteins and peptides. In general, the development timeline for a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application, or NDA, is shorter and less expensive than an NDA developed under Section 505(b)(1) for new chemical entities that have never been approved in the United States. Based upon MAT9001’s unique mixture of highly purified omega-3 free fatty acids and our observations of MAT9001’s enhanced bioavailability and potency as compared to Amarin Corporation’s Vascepa® (icosapent ethyl) in our initial head-to-head pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD), or PK/PD, clinical study, we believe that the results of our forthcoming targeted clinical development activities and related clinical investigations may yield an improved therapeutic profile compared to currently-existing therapies.
 
MAT9001 is a soft gelatin capsule containing a complex mixture of polyunsaturated free fatty acids, including multiple long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, including primarily eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosapentanoic acid (DPA). Amongst other properties, omega-3 fatty acids, which are also found in FDA-approved drugs in varying amounts, such as Vascepa®, have extensive clinical evidence of safety and efficacy in lowering triglycerides (TG) in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). We believe that based upon MAT9001’s unique composition, which includes more DPA than other known omega-3 fatty acids, it will prove to be differentiated from other existing therapies for the treatment of very high triglycerides, or severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG), and dyslipidemia.

Triglycerides are fats that are carried in the blood, together with cholesterol, within lipoproteins. High levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and in the case of severe hypertriglyceridemia, acute pancreatitis. High levels of triglycerides are due to both genetic and environmental factors and are associated with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal failure, and nephrotic syndrome. Unlike the currently approved products in this category, many of which have been repurposed following clinical failures in their originally intended indications, we have specifically designed and developed MAT9001 to treat SHTG, dyslipidemia and other cardiovascular and metabolic conditions.
 
In 2015, we announced results from our head-to-head PK/PD clinical study against Vascepa, a prescription-only ethyl ester formulation of EPA. This was an open-label, cross-over design study conducted in 42 patients with elevated triglyceride levels. Patients were treated for 14 days with MAT9001 or Vascepa, (4 grams/day for both treatment arms), followed by a five-week wash-out period, then crossed over to the other treatment. The main objectives of the study were to measure the relative bioavailability of MAT9001 versus Vascepa as well as effects on triglyceride levels. In this study, we observed statistical superiority of MAT90001 in reducing serum triglycerides, total- and non-HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein CIII and PCSK9 levels. MAT9001 was observed to significantly reduce PCSK9 in patients. In this trial, MAT9001 achieved greater median percentage reduction in four of six lipid measures, including total cholesterol, when compared to Vascepa.
 
We are focusing our initial efforts on developing MAT9001 with an initial indication for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia. If we receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for severe hypertriglyceridemia, we may seek approval for use of MAT9001 in additional indications, including the treatment of patients with mixed dyslipidemia who are already undergoing treatment with a statin, a commonly used class of cholesterol-lowering medications.
 
Consistent with our strategy first put in place when we filed the investigational new drug (IND) application for MAT9001 in 2014, we intend to pursue a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway towards NDA approval in the United States. Pursuant to this streamlined development approach, we are permitted to rely, at least in part, on FDA findings of safety and/or effectiveness for a previously approved drug. Based upon written feedback received from the FDA in 2014, we believe this approach will create the opportunity for us to leverage existing data developed with certain existing omega-3 fatty acids to create a streamlined approach to potential approval for MAT9001 for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥500 mg/dL). Simultaneously with those preclinical and clinical studies necessary for approval of this initial indication, we intend to conduct two additional studies designed to highlight the differentiated profile of MAT9001 vs. market leading omega-3 fatty acids and potentially yielding superior data in similar patient populations to those data generated by already-approved omega-3 fatty acids. We believe this dual development strategy will best position MAT9001 to secure an approval to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia as quickly as possible while also positioning MAT9001 as the best-in-class prescription omega-3 therapy as this market and regulatory requirements evolve.
 
While we advance MAT9001 toward pivotal trials in the cardiovascular space, we are also determined to maximize the value associated with our unique and potentially disruptive lipid nano-crystal (LNC) platform delivery technology. Our proprietary LNC platform delivery technology, licensed from Rutgers University on an exclusive worldwide basis, nano-encapsulates molecules and is designed to render these molecules orally bioavailable, well-tolerated and safe via fusogenic intracellular delivery. We believe the ability of our drug delivery technology to efficiently deliver drugs intracellularly may result in the targeted and safe delivery of pharmaceuticals directly to the site of infection or inflammation as well as the potential to treat a variety of cell-based pathogens, diseases and conditions. We believe our cochleate technology provides us with a highly stable, efficient and broadly applicable drug delivery platform, that has the potential to deliver a broad range of therapies, including small molecules, vaccines, peptides and proteins, as well as nucleic acid polymers in the gene therapy space (e.g., siRNA, mRNA, and CRISPR/Cas-9) in diseases and conditions exhibited by inflammation (e.g., CNS and infectious diseases) as well as intracellular diseases (e.g., intracellular pathogen-related, genetic disorders, and cancer).

Our lead drug candidate based on the LNC platform is MAT2203, an oral formulation of amphotericin B, a well-known and highly-effective, antifungal drug (though traditionally highly-toxic and currently only available in an intravenous formulation) currently used and approved to treat a variety of invasive, and potentially deadly, fungal infections. MAT2203 has been developed to date with the assistance and financial support of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). MAT2203 has been designated as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) with Fast Track Status for the treatment of invasive candidiasis, the treatment of aspergillosis and the prevention of invasive fungal infections in patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy. We have completed two Phase 2 studies of MAT2203 since 2015 and, leading up to and following a meeting with the Office of Antimicrobial Products (OAP) in January 2018, we had been positioning MAT2203 for an initial indication for the prophylaxis, or prevention, of invasive infections in patients who are suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are rendered immunosuppressed due to the therapies being utilized to treat these patients’ leukemia.


While we continue to believe that MAT2203 could become an important solution to the significant unmet medical need to prevent invasive fungal infections in immunosuppressed patients, we believe there are opportunities for a potentially more rapid approval of MAT2203 for the treatment of certain invasive fungal infections in areas of high unmet medical need which can be substantially supported by non-dilutive government funds. In partnership with the NIH, we have conducted numerous preclinical studies of MAT2203 for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. In such studies, we observed the potential for MAT2203, utilizing our LNC platform delivery technology, to (a) cross the blood-brain barrier, (b) treat this infection and (c) eliminate the toxicity normally associated with liposomal delivery of amphotericin B intravenously.
 
This data attracted the attention of several organizations, including the NIH, interested in finding a better treatment option for cryptococcal meningitis. The NIH recently approved and fully funded a grant submission from the University of Minnesota to conduct a clinical study of MAT2203 on patients with cryptococcal meningitis located in Uganda, Africa where this disease is very prevalent among the HIV-positive community. In consultation with the NIH and the University of Minnesota we are finalizing a protocol to commence this study during 2019. We believe that this clinical trial could become a registration-quality trial for an indication for MAT2203 to treat cryptococcal meningitis. We intend to finalize this protocol in the near term and then engage with the FDA to outline a potential pathway for approval of MAT2203 based upon this trial. Given the significant challenge associated with treating cryptococcal meningitis. Combined with the oral and targeted delivery and safety profile we believe the LNC platform delivery affords, we believe MAT2203 is well positioned to become a best-in-class antifungal drug. In addition, we believe that a demonstration that MAT2203 can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier in humans in this study could potentially position our LNC platform delivery technology to be utilized with molecules designed to treat diseases of the central nervous system exhibited by inflammation. Developing MAT2203 utilizing non-dilutive, government-sponsored, financing allows us to focus our internal cash resources on MAT9001 while advancing MAT2203 and our LNC platform technology into areas of significant unmet medical need and innovative medicine.


We have been engaged in discussions with various large, well-established and well-financed biotech and global pharmaceutical companies on potential applications of our LNC platform technology in the gene therapy space. Though early stage, these discussions have been based on existing data utilizing our LNC platform technology with complex nucleic acid polymers such as antisense oligonucleotides, mRNA, siRNA, and DNA plasmids. Our success in nano-encapsulating larger nucleic acids such as DNA plasmids, which can be as large as 11 kilobases in length, has also pushed us toward discussions with the NIH and others about utilizing our LNC platform delivery technology in the CRISPR-Cas9 space.
 
In July 2018, we announced a research collaboration with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), focused on the development of a novel therapy for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) combining targeted antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) and Matinas’ LNC delivery technology. In January 2019 we announced a research evaluation with a top global pharmaceutical company in which our LNC platform technology would be explored in delivering certain nucleic acid polymers, and we continue to pursue additional strategic collaborations with other interested biotech and pharmaceutical partners.

We believe these early stage, proof-of-concept evaluations could provide a more efficient, less expensive pathway to create numerous strategic verticals in areas of innovative medicine relying upon the development expertise and financial resources of well-established pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Our belief is that data from these evaluations could position us to become a licensor of our LNC platform delivery technology to numerous strategic partners better positioned to absorb the risks and costs of drug development while allowing our company to become a royalty aggregator with the potential to generate upfront license, milestone and royalty payments in order to utilize our LNC delivery platform technology.
 
Strategy
 
We are focused on creating value through the streamlined and strategic development of MAT9001 for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic conditions and the application of our LNC platform delivery technology to solve complex challenges relating to the delivery of small molecules, gene therapies, proteins/peptides, and vaccines. Key elements of our strategy include:

● | Strategically advancing MAT9001 into clinical development toward an initial indication for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥500 mg/dL) (SHTG) with the goal of creating additional data further demonstrating the differentiation of MAT9001 from other prescription omega-3 drugs being used to treat a mixed dyslipidemic patient population in a rapidly emerging and expanding omega-3 market. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expanding application of our lipid nano-crystal (LNC) delivery platform into the gene therapy space through collaborations with sophisticated and well-resourced biotech and pharmaceutical companies in innovative areas of medicine. 
● | Driving MAT2203 to efficacy data in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, an area of significant unmet medical need, with the non-dilutive financial support of the NIH. 

 
MAT9001
 
Our lead cardiovascular product candidate, MAT9001, is a proprietary prescription-only omega-3 fatty acid composition, comprised of a complex mixture of omega-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA, docosapentaenoic acid, or DPA, several other omega-3 fatty acids, and relatively nominal amounts of docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, and non-omega-3 fatty acids. We believe that based upon MAT9001’s unique composition, which includes more DPA than other known omega-3 fatty acids, it will prove to be differentiated from other existing therapies for the treatment of very high triglycerides, or severe hypertriglyceridemia, and dyslipidemia. Triglycerides are fats that are carried in the blood, together with cholesterol, within lipoproteins. High levels of triglyceride rich lipoproteins are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and in the case of severe hypertriglyceridemia, acute pancreatitis. High levels of triglycerides are due to both genetic and environmental factors and are associated with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal failure and nephrotic syndrome. Unlike the current approved therapies in this product category, many of which have been repurposed following clinical failures in their originally intended indications, we have specifically designed and developed MAT9001 to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia and dyslipidemia. We believe that the results of these targeted development activities and related clinical investigations may yield an improved therapeutic profile compared to the currently-existing therapies, characterized most importantly by MAT9001’s differentiating mechanistic features associated with its unique high DPA composition and enhanced potency as observed in our head to head clinical trial versus Vascepa.
 
We are primarily focused on developing MAT9001 through approval by the FDA, with an initial indication for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia. Severe hypertriglyceridemia refers to a condition in which patients have high blood levels of triglycerides (TG ≥ 500 mg/dl) and is recognized as an independent risk factor for pancreatitis and cardiovascular disease. If we receive FDA approval for severe hypertriglyceridemia, we may seek approval for use of MAT9001 in additional indications, including the treatment of patients with mixed dyslipidemia who are already undergoing treatment with a statin, a commonly used class of cholesterol lowering medications. Mixed dyslipidemia refers to a condition in which patients have a combination of both elevated triglycerides (≥200mg/dl), and elevated cholesterol levels. According to the NCEP Guidelines, we estimate that approximately 30 to 35 million Americans have mixed dyslipidemia.

Hypertriglyceridemia and Cardiovascular Disease Market Overview
 
Hypertriglyceridemia refers to a condition in which patients have levels of triglycerides in their blood above 200 mg/dL. Severe hypertriglyceridemia refers to a condition involving levels of triglycerides equal or above 500 mg/dL. Triglycerides (TG) are fats that are carried in the blood, together with cholesterol and lipoproteins. High levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Hypertriglyceridemia is due to both genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and high caloric diets. Hypertriglyceridemia is also associated with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal failure, and nephrotic syndrome.
 
The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia is rapidly increasing in the United States and throughout the world, correlating with the increasing incidence of obesity. Severe hypertriglyceridemia is also associated with markedly increased risk for cardiovascular disease and recent studies have demonstrated that elevated triglyceride levels can be regarded as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease-related events such as myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke.
 
Heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular events represent the leading cause of death and disability among men and women in western societies. More than 1 out of every 3 adults in the United States (approximately 92 million) currently lives with one or more types of cardiovascular disease; an estimated 800,000 new or recurrent coronary events and 795,000 new or recurrent strokes occur each year; an estimated 29 million adults ≥20 years of age have high total serum cholesterol levels (≥240 mg/dL), and an estimated 71 million adults ≥20 years of age have borderline high or high low-density lipoprotein (“bad”) cholesterol, or LDL-C, levels (≥130 mg/dL).
 
In addition to cholesterol, lipoproteins such as LDL also carry fats in the form of triglycerides. Hypertriglyceridemia refers to a condition in which patients have high levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream and has been reported to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Triglyceride levels provide important information as a marker associated with the risk for heart disease and stroke.
 
Guidelines for the management of very high triglyceride levels (≥500 mg/dL) suggest that reducing triglyceride levels is the primary treatment goal in these patients to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis. Treating LDL-C remains an important secondary goal. Other important parameters to consider in patients with very high triglycerides include levels of apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-HDL-C, and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C).
 
It is estimated that over 25 million adults in the United States have elevated triglyceride levels ≥200 mg/dL and that more than 50 million adults in the United States have elevated triglyceride levels ≥150 mg/dL. Additionally, approximately 4 million adults in the United States have very high triglyceride levels (≥500 mg/dL).
 
Mixed dyslipidemia refers to a condition in which patients have a combination of two or more lipid abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, and/or elevated LDL-C. Both hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia are components of a range of lipid disorders collectively referred to as dyslipidemia. Dyslipidemia has been linked to atherosclerosis, commonly referred to as hardening of the arteries.
 
Limitations of Current Therapies
 
Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a prevalent lipid disorder in approximately 25% of the U.S. adult population. Both epidemiological and genetic data have shown associations between HTG and coronary heart disease. Many of those patients are taking statin therapy directed at lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by lowering their LDL-C levels, primarily. Recently, real world administrative database analyses have reported an increased CVD risk as well as direct healthcare costs associated with HTG despite statin therapy and controlled LDL-C compared to those with TG<150 mg/dL.
 
There is currently no approved prescription omega-3 to lower TG levels in statin-treated patients with mixed dyslipidemia and persistent high (≥200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL) TG levels due to uncertainty raised by FDA in 2013 regarding the benefit, if any, of drug-induced changes in lipid/lipoprotein parameters beyond statin-lowered LDL-C on cardiovascular risk among statin-treated patients with residually high TG.

Additionally, recent cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trials and meta-analyses with low dose omega-3 fatty acid mixtures containing DHA have not shown substantial benefit in patients receiving contemporary medical therapy, including statins. Due to these failed low dose omega-3 CV outcomes trials, the European regulatory authorities have concluded that omega-3 fatty acid medicines at a dose of 1-gram per day are not effective in preventing further events for patients who have had a heart attack.
 
TG levels provide important information as a marker associate with the risk for heart disease and stroke, especially when an individual also has low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Multiple epidemiological, clinical, and genetic studies suggest that patients with elevated TG levels (>=200 mg/dL) are at a greater risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and pancreatitis, a life-threatening condition, as compared to those with normal TG levels. The genes regulating TGs and LDL-C are equally strong predictors of CAD, unlike HDL-C which is not. Other studies suggest that managing and lowering TG levels may reduce these risks.
 
Currently Available Treatment Options and Market Opportunity
 
The dramatic rise in obesity over the last few decades has led to a concomitant increase in cholesterol and triglyceride levels among the population. The collective term for high blood lipid levels such as high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels often used is “dyslipidemia.” Observational studies have resulted in an increased awareness of the critical role that high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels have as a predictor of cardiovascular events. Accordingly, the introduction of new drugs and novel mechanisms of action to lower the risk of cardiovascular events has become a priority. The initial treatment recommendation for patients with dyslipidemia is typically a low-fat diet. If that is not effective, dyslipidemia is then often treated with statins, which account for approximately 80% of all dyslipidemia prescriptions. Statins became a highly successful class of medications for the treatment of dyslipidemia due to their ability to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients at high risk for heart attacks, strokes, and other adverse cardiovascular events. Because of these outcome benefits, the statin utilization rate as compared to the incidence and prevalence of dyslipidemia in the general population, which we refer to as the epidemiology, has risen to almost 40% in the United States. However, the primary activity of statins is in the reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels and they have only modest effects on triglyceride levels. Recognizing that statins alone are not very effective triglyceride lowering drugs, the National Cholesterol Education Program panel recommends the use of more focused therapies to lower triglyceride levels in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Fibrates (a class of amphipathic carboxylic acids), omega-3 fatty acid-based medications and niacin have all been utilized to lower triglycerides levels. In patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, first-line drug therapy is often a prescription omega-3 or fibrate. Prescription omega-3 based products have been shown to reduce triglyceride levels in the range of 20%-45%.
 
The treatment rate of hypertriglyceridemia has remained relatively low – below ten percent - compared to the adult population with hypertriglyceridemia. Historically, fibrates such as gemfibrozil (Lopid) and fenofibrate (Tricor or Trilipix) have led the class of treatments of hypertriglyceridemia. However, due to their inability to establish clinical outcome benefits and their limited compatibility with statin therapy, the fibrate utilization rate has remained relatively low and is currently declining. Other products used to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia incorporating niacin as the active pharmaceutical ingredient have not been able to establish additional outcome benefits as compared to statin treatment alone, and are also encountering declining utilization. Because of their lack of outcome benefits, fibrate and niacin use has been mostly concentrated in severe hypertriglyceridemia.
 
Many omega-3 fatty acid based products have anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects that suggest effectiveness in inhibiting atherosclerosis in animal models as well as reducing the rate of adverse cardiovascular events in humans at high risk for such events as demonstrated in the JELIS Trial and the GISSI Prevenzione trial in Italy. Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acid based products, either concentrates of both EPA and DHA or EPA alone, have been demonstrated in multiple clinical trials to lower serum concentrations in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. In a recent third-party study, increased levels of EPA and DHA in red blood cells directly correlated with significant reductions in cardiovascular health risks. However, omega-3 fatty acid based medications with significant levels of DHA have been shown to increase LDL-cholesterol levels, which is a negative side effect.

The global prescription omega-3 market has been growing steadily over the last two decades and we estimate the market currently is approaching $2 billion in global sales. The leading omega-3 prescription pharmaceutical products currently approved for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia are Glaxo Smith Kline’s Lovaza (omega-3-acid ethyl esters, an omega-3 mixture containing mostly EPA and DHA, branded as Omacor in the rest of the world), Omacor and Seacor, very similar to Lovaza and marketed in Europe; and Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd’s (“Mochida”) Epadel (98% ethyl eicosapentaenoate), the leading Japanese omega-3 product. Recently, a new omega-3 based medication, Amarin’s Vascepa (97% ethyl eicosapentaenoate), was approved and launched in the United States. In addition, Astra Zeneca has an FDA-approved product, Epanova, which has not yet been launched.
 
MAT9001 Differentiation Strategy
 
In contrast to certain other omega-3 based prescription products, MAT9001 is not a product repurposed from a previous development program for another disease or condition, as it was specifically designed for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Specifically, we are pursuing two avenues of differentiation from existing products, including Vascepa and Lovaza:

1. | MAT9001 has unique mechanistic features due to its proprietary composition of omega-3 fatty acids, including DPA, which we believe is a key differentiating omega-3 fatty acid component (i.e., a component that is neither EPA nor DHA); and 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | MAT9001 is designed to have a highly concentrated potency versus other omega-3 products due to its free fatty acid formulation and potentially improved bioavailability relative to other omega-3 fatty acid pharmaceutical products, as demonstrated in our head to head study against Vascepa. Unlike ethyl-ester omega-3 fatty acid formulations, MAT9001 does not require enzymatic breakdown in the small intestine before it can be adequately absorbed. These enzymes are secreted in the intestine in response to dietary fats. Therefore, ethyl-ester omega-3 fatty acids are not optimally absorbed unless they are taken with a high-fat meal, which is contraindicated in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Because MAT9001 is less reliant on meal-fat content for optimal absorption, it has significantly greater bioavailability than the ethyl-ester form under the recommended low-fat diet conditions. 

 
We believe that based upon both publicly available preclinical and human data generated with MAT9001, as well as independent data associated with one of the key omega-3 components contained in MAT9001, our product has the potential to:
 

1. | Better control cholesterol, and may decrease low-density lipoproteins, or LDL, cholesterol levels; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Demonstrate superior reduction across numerous lipid biomarkers, including triglycerides, VLDL, non-HDL and Apo-C3 levels; and 
3. | Produce certain gene regulatory effects, such as the down regulation of HMG-CoA reductase and PCSK9. 

 
In addition, MAT9001 contains a much lower concentration of DHA than certain competitive omega-3 products, such as Lovaza or Epanova (products with mixtures of mostly EPA and DHA). As described above, these products reduce triglycerides as the main desired effect but also have the negative side effect of increasing LDL-cholesterol levels. This side effect is observed with the use of Lovaza and Epanova in patients with severe hypertriglyceredemia as well as in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. In contrast, products with very low concentrations of DHA, such as Vascepa, have not shown the increase in LDL-cholesterol levels relative to placebo in either the severe hypertriglyceridemia or mixed dyslipedemia patient populations. Omega-3 products containing low DHA levels have also demonstrated reductions in LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels. We believe MAT9001’s unique composition will produce differentiating results in reducing both cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Further, based on our product design, we believe that MAT9001 is well-positioned to become a leading treatment for severe hypertriglyceridemia if approved by the FDA.

MAT9001’s free fatty acid form of omega-3 differentiates it from competitors and we believe this distinction leads to numerous clinical advantages. In a head to head study vs. Vascepa, as detailed further below, improved absorption characteristics and bioavailability were observed for MAT9001 as compared to Vascepa. Our PK/PD head-to-head trial compared the bioavailability of MAT9001 and Vascepa and it was observed that MAT9001’s free fatty acid form was less reliant on meal-fat content for optimal absorption than Vascepa’s ethyl-ester omega-3 form, which requires a high-fat meal for optimal absorption. It was also observed that patients on a low-fat diet exhibited five times higher blood plasma levels of EPA relative to Vascepa. Additional benefits of MAT9001’s improved bioavailability may include once-a-day dosing, reduced pill burden and accompanying heightened patient compliance. All adverse events (AEs) reported in this study (whether related or unrelated to study drugs) were mild or moderate in severity. The most commonly reported AEs judged as possibly related to the study drug were dry skin and rhinorrhea. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported during the conduct of this study. The study medications were well-tolerated by patients in this study as well.
 
We believe that MAT9001, with its unique ratios of omega-3 free fatty acids, increased plasma concentrations of EPA compared to Vascepa, potential once-a-day dosing convenience, and observed degree of bioavailability and potential to reduce triglyceride levels as observed in our studies to date, is well-positioned to address significant unmet medical need and become a standard of care in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Furthermore, we believe that MAT9001, due to the gene regulatory effects of DPA, in combination with statins, if approved by FDA, could become a standard of care in patients with mixed dyslipidemia with a prescribing and commercial advantage favoring products with a once per day dosing convenience similar to statins.
 
Development History
 
We believe we have optimized the manufacturing process for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of MAT9001 and have completed various preclinical studies and one human clinical trial with the MAT9001 active ingredient. We completed the first preclinical studies of MAT9001 in 2013 with others completed during 2014. In 2015, we announced results from our Head-to-Head PK/PD Trial against Vascepa in which we observed statistical superiority in reducing serum triglycerides, total- and non-HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein CIII and PCSK9 levels. The study was a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, open-label crossover study designed to compare the bioavailability and effects of MAT9001 versus Vascepa on serum triglyceride levels. Forty-two patients were treated with 4 grams/day of MAT9001 or Vascepa for 14 days, followed by a wash-out period and crossed over to the other treatment arm. Study subjects had fasting TG levels of 200-400 mg/dl without lipid altering therapy, or fasting TG levels of 200 to 350 mg/dL if they were on stable-dose statin monotherapy. MAT9001 was observed to significantly reduce PCSK9 in patients. In this trial, MAT9001 achieved greater median percentage reduction in four of six lipid measures, including total cholesterol, when compared to Vascepa:

● | MAT9001 significantly reduced median TG levels by 33.2 percent compared to 10.5 percent for Vascepa (p-value <0.001); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | MAT9001 significantly reduced median very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) levels by 32.5 percent compared to 8.1 percent for Vascepa (p-value <0.001); 
● | MAT9001 significantly reduced median non-HDL-C levels by 8.8 percent compared to 4.6 percent for Vascepa (p-value=0.027); 
● | MAT9001reduced median HDL-C levels by 11.3 percent compared to 11.1 percent for Vascepa (p-value= 0.337); 
● | MAT9001 reduced median LDL-C levels by 2.4 percent compared to 4.3 percent for Vascepa (p-value=0.116); and 
● | MAT9001 significantly reduced median total cholesterol levels by 9 percent compared to 6.2 percent for Vascepa (p-value=0.013).

MAT9001 also outperformed Vascepa in reductions in apolipoproteins (apo) and PCSK9 as compared to baseline:
 

● | MAT9001 reduced median apolipoprotein B levels by 3.8 percent compared to 0.7 percent for Vascepa (p-value=0.058); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | MAT9001 significantly reduced median apolipoprotein AI levels by 15.3 percent compared to 10.2 percent for Vascepa (p-value=0.003); 
● | MAT9001 significantly reduced median apolipoprotein CIII levels by 25.5 percent compared to 5 percent for Vascepa (p-value=0.006); and 
● | MAT9001 significantly reduced median PCSK9 levels by 12.3 percent compared to an 8.8 percent increase in PCSK9 levels for Vascepa (p-value <0.001). 

 
Pre-treatment median values for lipids, triglycerides, apolipoproteins, and PCSK9 levels were measured. Patients were randomized and put on MAT9001 or Vascepa for 14 days. Following the initial treatment period, there was a 5-week washout period, following which patients were put on the other therapy for 14 days. Forty patients completed the trial. MAT9001 met its primary PK endpoint for bioavailability of omega-3 for MAT9001 relative to Vascepa in this study. Statistical analysis demonstrated superiority of MAT9001 over Vascepa for omega-3 bioavailability (baseline adjusted AUC and Cmax, approximately 6-fold higher with MAT9001 on Day 14, with very high statistical significance).
 
MAT9001 Development Plan
 
Following announcement of our head to head study vs. Vascepa in 2015, due primarily to cardiovascular regulatory and commercial market conditions, as well as limited financial resources, we determined to slow down development of MAT9001 until such time as data became available from Amarin’s cardiovascular outcomes trial, REDUCE-IT™.
 
Following the release of data from the Amarin REDUCE-IT trial, we have re-initiated our development efforts and activities for MAT9001. With the support of a world-class team of key opinion leaders, clinicians and regulatory experts we have designed a development program for MAT9001 designed to (a) potentially streamline our path to approval for MAT9001 in its initial indication to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia and, (b) create additional data both head to head vs. Vascepa and in a mixed dyslipidemic patient population in order to position MAT9001 to become the potential best-in-class omega-3 prescription product for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular conditions. Our regulatory strategy with FDA will include leveraging a 505(b)(2) registration pathway, consistent with the feedback we received from FDA during 2014. We are in the process of reactivating our IND and expect to complete this activity in the second quarter of 2019.
 
Pursuant to our development strategy, we intend to advance MAT9001 into a series of clinical trials designed to (a) complete those studies required for approval of an initial indication to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥500mg/dL) and, (b) complete additional trials to demonstrate the differentiation of MAT9001 vs. competitive approved omega-3 products and also create the potential for label enhancement in a mixed dyslipidemic patient population (patients with triglyceride levels 200-499 mg/dL).
 
During 2019 we intend to initiate and complete the following studies (a) a 28-day comparative bridging toxicology study, and (b)subject to any feedback from FDA, a comparative clinical bioavailability study (36 healthy volunteers) with key endpoints and assessments to include PK parameters (e.g., AUC, Cmax, Tmax, t1/2) for total EPA, DHA and DPA and comparison of PK parameters for MAT9001 after a high fat meal and also fasting vs. fed.
 
Following completion of these studies, we intend to request an End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with FDA to review the data from the completed studies and to gain a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) on our pivotal study protocol for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia. During this meeting, we intend to present the design of a Phase 3 registration study in SHTG patients. We anticipate, subject to feedback from FDA, that the study will be a placebo-controlled study with two dose groups of MAT9001: 2 gram and 4 gram/day. We anticipate that approximately 270 patients will be randomized 1:1:1. It is planned that MAT9001 will be dosed either once or twice daily without regard to meals. The primary endpoint of the study is anticipated to be change in TG levels at Week 12.
 
In addition to the studies required for approval to treat SHTG, we intend to conduct additional trials, including a comparative PK/PD study vs. Vascepa and a second Phase 3 trial of MAT9001 as an add-on to statin therapy in patients with high triglycerides (200-499 mg/dL) at risk for cardiovascular disease. We anticipate that our second head to head study vs. Vascepa will generate topline data during the second half of 2020.

MAT2203 - Our Lead Product Using our LNC Delivery Platform Technology
 
We have leveraged our platform lipid nano-crystal (LNC) platform delivery technology to develop two clinical-stage products that we believe have the potential to become best-in-class drug. Our lead LNC platform product candidate, MAT2203, is an orally-administered LNC formulation of a broad spectrum anti-fungal drug called amphotericin B. We previously had been planning to conduct a Phase 2/3 adaptive-design study of MAT2203 in patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) for the prevention of invasive fungal infections (IFI) due to immunosuppressive therapy. While we continue to believe that MAT2203 could become an important solution to the significant unmet medical need to prevent invasive fungal infections in immunosuppressed patients, we believe there are opportunities for a potentially more rapid approval of MAT2203 for the treatment of certain invasive fungal infections in areas of high unmet medical need which can be substantially supported by non-dilutive government funds. In partnership with the NIH, we have conducted numerous preclinical studies of MAT2203 for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. In such studies, we observed the potential for MAT2203, utilizing our LNC platform delivery technology, to (a) cross the blood-brain barrier, (b) treat this infection and (c) eliminate the toxicity normally associated with liposomal delivery of amphotericin B intravenously.
 
We now plan to initially develop MAT2203 for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, one of the most frequent and opportunistic infections in Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus (HIV) patients. Given the high morbidity associated with cryptococcal meningitis in HIV patients, the clinical unmet need is globally very high with the global burden estimated at 1 million cases annually. We plan to leverage the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for MAT2203, in part relying upon FDA’s findings of the efficacy of amphotericin B, and anticipate meeting with the FDA in the first half of 2019 to discuss our development plans for MAT2203. We also plan to seek accelerated approval for this indication. We are in the final planning stages for a Phase 2 clinical trial, fully funded by the NIH and conducted by the University of Minnesota at their clinic in Uganda. We believe that this study may have the potential to become a pivotal study to support approval of MAT2203 for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, and we also plan to submit an application for Orphan Designation and QIDP Designation during the first half of 2019.


Our second clinical stage LNC-based product candidate is MAT2501, an orally administered, cochleate formulation of the broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic amikacin which may be used to treat different types of multidrug-resistant bacteria, including non-tuberculous mycobacterium infections (NTM), as well as various multidrug-resistant gram negative and intracellular bacterial infections. In May 2017, we completed and announced topline results from a Phase 1 single escalating dose clinical trial of MAT2501 in healthy volunteers in which no serious adverse events were reported and where oral administration of MAT2501 at all tested doses yielded blood levels that were well below the safety levels recommended for injected amikacin, supporting further development of MAT2501 for the treatment of NTM infections. We have decided to temporarily halt clinical development of MAT2501, in order to prioritize and accelerate the development of MAT9001 and MAT2203 and explore utilization of our LNC platform delivery technology in the gene therapy space.
 
MAT2203 - Product Profile
 
MAT2203 is an orally-administered, LNC formulation of amphotericin B (a broad-spectrum fungicidal agent). Little to no clinical resistance has been reported to date with amphotericin B as compared to the rapidly emerging drug resistance seen in other antifungal therapies. Currently, IV-only administered amphotericin B is the only broad spectrum fungicidal; however, it has significant treatment-limiting side effects, most notably nephrotoxicity. The ability to provide amphotericin B orally using our proprietary and novel oral formulation comprising our LNC platform delivery technology, may offer a new and promising alternative for patients and doctors. In a clinical Phase 1 single-dose, double-blind, dose-escalating, pharmacokinetic study of 48 healthy volunteers, oral MAT2203 was observed to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported, and without any observed nephrotoxicity. The most commonly reported AEs were nausea and abdominal pain. None of the AEs were related to abnormal laboratory evaluations. All treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild except 1 instance of “upper respiratory tract infection” which was moderate in a subject following 800 mg MAT2203. No AEs led to withdrawal. There were no serious AEs. There was one pregnancy (subsequently determined that the conception date was 1 to 2 days prior to dosing) resulting in elective termination from the study. More recently, in our Phase 2 trial of MAT2203 conducted by the National Institutes of Health, four out of four enrolled patients met their primary efficacy endpoint, three patients continue on treatment of which two have been successfully taking MAT2203 for more than two years as part of a long term safety extension, with no evidence of kidney or other toxicity frequently associated with the use of amphotericin B.

Antifungal Market Opportunity
 
The overall global antifungal market accounted for $10.7 billion in 2015 with estimated annual worldwide sales of prescription systemic antifungal drugs reaching approximately $4 billion. This includes therapies used as active treatment or prophylaxis (preventative) in the inpatient and outpatient setting, therapies used for the treatment of hospitalized patients and therapies used for the treatment of patients who are being discharged from the hospital. We estimate that, each year, there are over 1.5 million cases of invasive fungal infections caused by various species of Candida, Aspergillus and Cryptococcus, the three most common invasive fungal pathogens, globally. The estimated incidence in the U.S. for these conditions is approximately 46,000 for invasive candidiasis, 6,000 for invasive aspergillosis, and 3,000 for cryptococcal meningitis. The rapid progression of disease and high mortality rates (20% - 50%) associated with documented invasive fungal infections often result in antifungal therapy being administered in suspected (unconfirmed) cases or as a preventative measure in patients at high risk. Also, the increasingly widespread use of immune suppressive drugs as cancer chemotherapy or for organ transplantation or treatment of autoimmune disease has resulted in an increasing population of patients at risk for invasive fungal infections. Furthermore, the limited number of systemic antifungal drug classes, consisting of azoles, echinocandins and polyenes, and their extensive use, has led to increased numbers of infections with drug-resistant strains. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed fluconazole-resistant Candida as a serious threat requiring prompt and sustained action and has also identified a rise in echinocandin resistance, especially among Candida glabrata. In June 2016, the CDC issued an extraordinary alert for healthcare facilities and providers to be on the lookout for patients with Candida auris, a multidrug resistant strain with high mortality (approximately 60%). Almost half of C. auris isolates are multidrug resistant to two or more antifungal classes (large majority resistant to fluconazole, 40% resistant to echinocandins). We believe this underscores the urgent need for new agents with demonstrated activity against resistant strains and that can be administered with significantly less toxicity and the potential to discharge patients earlier to reduce hospital stays and associated costs.
 
Physicians’ options for the treatment of fungal infections are limited by a lack of innovative therapies. Several factors have contributed to the low rate of antifungal drug development, including a previously challenging regulatory environment that necessitated large and costly clinical trials. As a result of this regulatory environment and other factors, the number of antifungals in development has decreased, while anti-microbial resistance has increased.
 
Our Solution – MAT2203
 
Our lead anti-infective product candidate, MAT2203, is an application of our LNC platform delivery technology to a broad spectrum anti-fungal drug called amphotericin B. Amphotericin B is an IV administered drug used as a last resort for treatment of systemic fungal infections resistant to triazoles and echinocandins, including resistant candidiasis, cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, and aspergillosis. To date, there have been little to no reports of clinically observed drug-resistance to amphotericin B, further bolstering the use of this compound as the most likely last resort treatment for fungal infections in the foreseeable future. However, the use of amphotericin B is relatively limited because it is currently only available as an IV-administered product and has documented history of severe toxicity (most notably nephrotoxicity). By utilizing our LNC platform delivery technology to nano-encapsulate amphotericin B, there is now an opportunity for the drug to be administered orally with targeted delivery to infected cells, which we believe may have fewer side effects than the currently available IV-formulations of amphotericin B. Our LNC delivery of amphotericin B changes the bio-distribution, resulting in a higher level of the drug at the site of infection and a lower level of circulating amphotericin B. By reducing the amount of circulating drug, our LNC may reduce overall toxicity. Importantly, drug concentrations will be high only in tissues due to the migratory nature of macrophages to inflammatory regions. Based upon our studies to date, we believe MAT2203 has the potential to offer improved safety and reduced toxicity and, as a result, we believe MAT2203 will be able to offer a categorically different formulation that delivers orally administered amphotericin B, directly to the target cell at the site of infection. In collaboration with the NIH, in multiple studies, we have demonstrated in cryptococcal meningitis mouse models that our LNC-delivered amphotericin B, following oral administration, has the ability to successfully cross the blood brain barrier to the site of infection in mice. This demonstration provides important data indicating that our LNC platform delivery technology could become an important delivery solution for a variety of CNS-based disorders and diseases.

We believe that MAT2203 has the potential to become a best-in-class induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV patients by offering the following key benefits:
 

● | Potential to treat resistant pathogens. We believe that MAT2203 has the potential to prevent and treat fungal infections caused by drug resistant fungi, including those resistant to existing azoles and echinocandins, due to amphotericin B’s fungicidal (i.e. killing the fungi) nature and potency against resistant strains and the potential for our cochleate drug delivery platform to provide higher drug exposure early in the course of therapy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enabling an all-oral therapy. Cryptococcal meningitis has become the most common cause of adult meningitis in many parts of Africa, where cryptococcosis now rivals tuberculosis in all-case mortality. While long-term survival has improved with widespread use of antiretroviral therapy in high income countries, early mortality remains high. Early mortality rates are often ~ 70% in routine practice where access to diagnostics or medications is limited or unavailable, intracranial pressure is uncontrolled, or in settings where other barriers to the management of cryptococcal meningitis exist. IV administration of amphotericin B deoxycholate is not often possible in resource-limited settings, even when it is available. 
● | Shorter and less costly hospital stays and lower outpatient costs. By providing physicians and patients with access to an orally available, broad spectrum fungicidal agent in MAT2203, there is the potential to reduce hospital costs, which account for over 70% of the overall treatment cost of invasive fungal infections. 

 
The FDA has granted MAT2203 designations for Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, and Fast Track for the treatment of invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis and for the prevention of IFIs in patients on immunosuppressive therapy. We are in the process of applying for a fourth QIDP for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. We will also apply for Orphan Drug Designation for MAT2203 for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. The FDA may designate a product candidate as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as having a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. The orphan drug designation provides eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity in the United States upon FDA approval if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation. For a product that obtains orphan drug designation on the basis of a plausible hypothesis that it is clinically superior to the same drug that is already approved for the same indication, in order to obtain orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, clinical superiority of such product to this same drug that is already approved for the same orphan indication must be demonstrated. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approved any other applications, including an NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances such as if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Similarly, the FDA can subsequently approve a drug with the same active moiety for the same condition during the exclusivity period if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior, meaning the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, a waiver from payment of user fees, an exemption from performing clinical studies in pediatric patients unless the FDA requires otherwise by regulation, and tax credits for the cost of the clinical research. The QIDP designation, provided under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, offers certain incentives for the development of new antibacterial or antifungal drugs, including eligibility for Fast Track designation, priority review and, if approved by the FDA, eligibility for an additional five years of marketing exclusivity. Fast Track designation enables more frequent interactions with FDA to expedite drug development and review. Fast Track designation does not change the standards for approval and we can provide no assurances that we can maintain Fast Track designation for MAT2203 or that such designation will result in faster regulatory review. The seven-year period of marketing exclusivity provided through orphan designation, if granted, combined with an additional five years of marketing exclusivity provided by the QIDP designation positions MAT2203 with a potential for a total of 12 years of marketing exclusivity to be granted at the time of FDA approval. Our plan is to further secure QIDP/Fast Track/Orphan Designation for the initial development target indication of cryptococcal meningitis.

Development History of MAT2203 and Initial Target Indication
 
MAT2203 was studied in animal model studies of various fungal infections including invasive candidiasis, aspergillosis and cryptococcal meningitis.
 
The data from animal studies for MAT2203 indicate a side-effect advantage over other amphotericin B formulations, which we believe is based on two phenomena:
 

● | The lipid-crystal nano-particle is a solid particle that does not significantly “leak” its drug content while circulating. The particle releases its medication pay-load only when inside the target cells, and thus appears that the use of MAT2203 does not result in toxicities normally seen in the kidneys when using current formulations of amphotericin B. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Because of this targeted approach, we have been able to increase the therapeutic window on a mg/kg basis as compared to IV amphotericin B formulations. We have observed equivalent efficacy at lower doses as well as been able to use oral doses of up to 10x the highest tolerable IV dose in animal model studies. 

 
NIH-Conducted Study
 
In early 2017, we reported interim data from the NIH-Conducted Phase 2a Clinical Study of Orally-Administered MAT2203 for the Treatment of Chronic Refractory Mucocutaneous Candidiasis. At that time, two out of the two patients with long-standing azole resistant mucocutaneous candidiasis met the primary endpoint of the Phase 2a study, achieving ≥ 50% clinical response with treatment of MAT2203. Patient #01 achieved a 57% reduction in clinical symptoms after 8 weeks on therapy while patient #02 achieved an 85% reduction in such clinical symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment. MAT2203 was well tolerated with majority of adverse events observed being mild in severity and mostly unrelated to study drug. Importantly, for both patients renal and liver function parameters remained well within normal ranges during the core study as well as during the first 6-month extension of this study. In July 2017, the NIH/NIAID institutional review board approved continuation of treatment of patients in the study-extension for an additional 6 months, for total extension of up to one year.
 
In January 2018, the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) reported positive data from a third patient enrolled in this study. This third patient, with long-standing azole resistant mucocutaneous candidiasis, met the primary endpoint of the Phase 2a study in achieving ≥ 50% clinical response with treatment of MAT2203. MAT2203 was well tolerated with any adverse events observed being mild in severity and unrelated to study drug. With this third positive response, the study has met its statistical hurdle for success. In June of 2018, the NIH reported that a fourth patient had enrolled in the study and had met the primary endpoint in achieving ≥ 50% clinical response with treatment of MAT2203. All four patients had been enrolled in a long-term study extension and the initial two patients have now shown no signs of kidney or liver toxicity over the approximately twenty-four months of being administered MAT2203. The third patient was required to drop out of the long-term safety portion of the study due to the development of an infection that does not respond to amphotericin B. The fourth patient continues in the long-term safety extension for the study. The clinical response to MAT2203 seen in all three patients continuing on drug has been maintained and/or improved during the extension period in addition to patients reporting meaningful quality-of-life improvements.
 
VVC Study
 
In late 2017, we announced the topline data from our Phase 2 study in Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC) using MAT2203. In the context of our overall program for MAT2203 with the aim to develop our lead product initially for the prevention of invasive fungal infections in patients who are immunocompromised due to immunosuppressive therapy, our goal was, in addition to further establishing the safety and tolerability of MAT2203, to demonstrate efficacy of MAT2203 through a mechanism involving systemic absorption in a non-life threatening fungal infection. This study concept was consistent with early human efficacy studies in the development of other anti- fungal therapies. This Phase 2 study was not designed or powered to support an indication for the treatment of VVC and therefore supplant fluconazole as the standard of care. The key data generated from this study included additional safety and tolerability data.
 

-14-

In this VVC study, the primary endpoint of safety was met, and it was demonstrated that oral delivery of encochleated amphotericin B is safe and well tolerated without the renal and hepatic toxicities that can be seen with administration of intravenous amphotericin B. Drug-related treatment emergent adverse events in this study were mostly of mild and gastro-intestinal nature and were seen at a rate of 20%, 18% and 2% respectively for MAT2203 200mg, MAT2203 400mg, and fluconazole. Consistent with the safety observations in the NIH study, in this VVC study no drug-related effects on liver function were observed and kidney function parameters stayed within normal ranges during the entire study for all 91 patients treated with MAT2203 for 5 days.
 
Development Plan
 
In February 2019, the NIH approved the funding of a planned clinical trial related to a grant application submitted by The University of Minnesota to study MAT2203 for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. The clinical study will be conducted in Uganda and has already received the approval of all necessary regulatory authorities. The protocol is in the process of being finalized and the trial is anticipated to consist of two parts with the following design. The initial portion of the trial will be a Phase 1 Study conducted in HIV patients in Uganda without active neurological infection. Subjects in this initial phase of the study will involve a determination of the maximal tolerated dose to arrive at an optimal dose for the second part of the study. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the data from the initial phase prior to commencing the efficacy portion of the trial. Upon review of the data, the DMC will make a recommendation to the Ethics Committee/IRB as to the dose to be used in the efficacy portion of the study in patients with active neurological infection. The efficacy portion of the study has been designed as an open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and microbiologic efficacy of oral MAT2203 as part of induction and consolidation treatment of HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis compared with standard intravenously delivered amphotericin B. Participants in the study will be enrolled in sequential cohorts designed to mitigate the risk associated with these very sick patients. Induction treatment in each cohort will start with IV amphotericin and flucytosine treatment with oral MAT2203 administered as step-down treatment for the initial two cohorts (with earlier step-down to MAT2203 in each subsequent cohort.) The next two cohorts will test the induction of treatment with our MAT2203 product, with step-down treatment to IV amphotericin. The final cohort of patients will have a MAT2203 induction treatment (plus flucytosine) without IV administered amphotericin B. The primary endpoint for this trial will be the rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Cryptococcus clearance as measured by serial quantitative CSF fungal cultures. This study is planned to commence in the second half of 2019. The trial design is expected to be finalized during 2019 following a meeting with FDA.
 
We are currently completing a 90-day rat toxicology study to support dosing with MAT2203 beyond the current 28-day tox coverage. The in-life portion of the study has been completed. There have been no signs of toxicity noted to date.
 
Our plan is to meet with FDA to review our development plan and study design as we intend to conduct this Phase 2 study in patients with cryptococcal meningitis under a US IND. We additionally will discuss with FDA our plans to leverage a 505(b)(2) Pathway, relying, in part, upon FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of I.V. amphotericin B.
 
Our Cochleate Platform Delivery Technology
 
Cochleate lipid-crystal nano-particles are composed of simple, naturally occurring materials: phosphatidylserine (PS) and calcium. They are stable and have a unique multilayered structure consisting of a large, continuous, solid, lipid bilayer sheet rolled up in a spiral or as stacked sheets, with no internal aqueous space (Figure 1). This unique structure provides protection from degradation for “encochleated” molecules. Components within the interior of the cochleate remain intact, even though the outer layers of the cochleate may be exposed to harsh environmental conditions or enzymes.

-15-
----

Figure 1 Cochleate Formulation
 

The structure is formed when a series of solid lipid sheets engulf drug molecules, a process referred to as “encochleation.” Encochleation, developed by Matinas and Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, involves combining calcium and soy-derived PS, two naturally occurring materials classified as GRAS (generally recognized as safe), through a stirring process to envelop the active pharmacological ingredient. The result is a nano-size encochleated drug formulation (Figure 2).
Figure 2 Formation of Cochleate
 


Cochleates have been shown to improve existing drugs by providing 1) cell-targeted delivery; 2) reduced blood levels thereby reducing toxicity; and 3) oral delivery of drugs now only available intravenously. Cochleates work by encapsulating molecules of drugs in a solid, anhydrous, crystalline structure, protecting them as they pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where they cross the mucous membrane. Once the cochleates have crossed the mucosal barrier of the GI tract into the lymphatic system, they are picked up by particle scavenging cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. (Figure 3). Activated macrophages, with drug-cochleate inside, migrate to the site of infection or to the target organ and deliver amphotericin B.

Cells in the mononuclear phagocytic system are immune cells that have the capacity to engulf and destroy numerous potentially pathogenic materials and organisms within the body. These cells are found in almost every site of the body, save a few ‘immune privileged’ sites (e.g. eyes, fetus, and testes). Such cells help with non-specific (innate) immune defenses as well as help initiate specific (adaptive) immune responses, thus they play a critical role bridging the gap between innate and adaptive immune responses. Our core capabilities combine the use of lipids as active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and the use of lipids in “cochleate-shaped” lipid-crystal nano-particle drug delivery vehicles. Therapeutic applications of our proprietary delivery technology were initially focused on the delivery of several potent and highly efficacious anti-fungal and anti-bacterial agents which are currently still associated with serious side effects, including irreversible toxic effects on kidney and hearing function. We believe our technology has the potential for targeted delivery of these agents, which positions us to be at the forefront of dealing with these very serious problems. We have now also expanded our research and development efforts for our LNC Platform to focus on the delivery of a wide range of therapeutic treatments, in particular those in the oligonucleotide space (siRNA, DNA, antisense DNA, mRNA, and CRISPR-Cas9). We continue to push forward our business development efforts to further expand our collaborations across pharma and biotech companies who have innovative therapies with delivery challenges which may be addressable with our LNC platform delivery technology.
 
Our LNC technology is currently being used to encapsulate potent anti-infective drugs in tiny lipid-crystals which are selectively picked up by cells in the mononuclear phagocytic system, such as macrophages, and transported to infected cells. These tiny lipid crystals are referred to as “cochleates.” Cochleates have a multilayer crystalline, spiral structure with no internal aqueous space. The structure is formed when a series of solid lipid sheets roll up and engulf drug molecules in between the sheets, a proprietary process referred to as “encochleation”. The result is a lipid-crystal encochleated drug formulation made up of nano-sized particles. We believe our cochleate delivery technology provides an effective delivery mechanism without chemically bonding or otherwise altering the drug. Because the medications are locked in the particles, we believe the exposure to sensitive organs will be reduced, potentially resulting in reduced toxic effects. In summary, we believe this unique technology offers (1) targeted delivery, (2) decreased toxic effects, and (3) oral formulation (even for IV-only medications).
 
Multi-organ Protection: The key innovation of our cochleate delivery technology is our ability to package medication inside lipid-crystal particles without leaking. Because of their crystal nature, these particles are truly solid and hold on tightly to their medication pay-load. This is where the cochleate delivery technology differs markedly from other lipid-based delivery technology, such as liposomal delivery. Liposomes are liquid delivery systems which typically leak some of their drug content into the circulatory system, thus still exposing vulnerable organs and tissues to potential toxic effects. Keeping potentially organ-toxic medications inside the lipid-crystal particles strongly differentiates our cochleate delivery technology from other drug-delivery approaches.
 
Targeted Delivery: The size of our individual cochleate lipid-crystals is typically in the range of 50-500 nm. This is very small and by comparison close to the size of a large virus or a small bacteria. Our body produces several cell-types that are designed to remove viruses and bacteria from our system. These cell types, such as macrophages, are part of our immune system and “swallow” the bacteria and viruses they encounter in order to protect us from infections. Because of the size our lipid-crystal cochleate particles and the phospholipid surface structure (the cell membranes of bacteria are also made up from phospholipids), macrophages tend to absorb these cochleate particles very well.
 
Oral Formulation: Many drugs that are currently on the market are only effective in treating diseases when administered via IV. For example, many anti-infective drugs must be administered via IV in order to be effective. IV administration presents several challenges to care, such as risk of infection, patient discomfort from injections, and higher cost of care than anti-infective drugs that can be taken orally (IV delivery must be performed by a doctor or nurse, often within a very expensive hospital setting). Although several technologies have been used to attempt to convert IV drugs to orally delivered medications, success has been limited due to the difficulty in achieving adequate bioavailability (i.e., the amount of drug that is absorbed into the body) with oral formulation. We believe that the unique cochleate crystal-structure in our platform technology protects the drug from degradation when it passes through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and that its lipid surface features facilitate the particle to be absorbed into the blood stream. The potential application of our cochleate delivery technology for the delivery of injectable medications offers significant clinical and commercial value if successfully demonstrated in human clinical trials. It is our intent to further validate the LNC Platform technology in our planned cryptococcal meningitis study.
 
Our cochleate lipid-crystal nano-particle technology changes the delivery of medicines in a unique manner and alters the bio-distribution of these medications by targeting tissues and organs that are affected by infection and inflammation. Besides IV-only anti-infectives such as amphotericin B and amikacin, we have orally delivered in animal studies the influenza vaccine, siRNA, NSAIDs, other anti-infectives such as atovaquone, and many other compounds across multiple therapeutic areas, demonstrating the potential broad application of our technology. We have observed rapid local accumulation in infected tissues, which appear be the result of transport of our drug-loaded cochleates by macrophages and other immune-cells. For example, in a mouse model of invasive candidiasis, comparing orally administered MAT2203 to injected amphotericin B deoxycholate (original drug Fungizone), we observed amphotericin B levels above the minimal inhibitory concentration inside infected organs on day 1 with MAT2203 treatment while such levels were not reached with the injected original amphotericin-deoxycholate product until 3-4 days of treatment. Such kinetics have been seen before with other medications, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin). It appears from our data that the kinetics of cochleate delivery has similarities to the kinetics of macrolide antibiotics. We expect that additional preclinical and clinical work on the kinetics of our cochleate products will further elucidate the mechanism of cochleate delivery to the site of infection or inflammation.

Strategic Collaborations Using LNC Technology
 
We believe our LNC platform delivery technology can be used to reformulate a wide variety of molecules and drugs which, (i) require delivery technology to effectively protect molecules and drugs in the body and could benefit from efficient delivery and cellular uptake by target cells, and (ii) are currently only available in IV formulations or, (iii) otherwise experience significant toxicity-related adverse events. Leveraging our cochleate delivery technology, we believe we can develop a robust pipeline of product candidates, either internally or through robust strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotech companies. We have tested a range of pharmaceutical compounds reformulated by our cochleate delivery technology in proof-of-concept animal studies, including oligonucleotides (mRNA, siRNA, DNA plasmids), vaccines, anti-inflammatory agents, NSAIDs and atovaquone. By way of example, in 2016 we received a patent issuance related to LNC compositions directed against expressions of proteins. The allowed patent claims cover our proprietary methods related to the composition and the formation of encochleated siRNA for potential use as therapy for regulating gene expression. We intend to pursue opportunities to develop products, either alone or in partnership with other pharmaceutical or biotech companies, related to this technology and this remains a key part of our strategy to maximize the value of this unique and disruptive lipid-crystal nanoparticle delivery technology.
 
We continue to actively collaborate with the NIH on a number of therapeutic fronts to further expand the generation of data to support broad use of our LNC platform technology across broad therapeutic treatment modalities. In July 2018, we announced a research collaboration with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) focused on the development of a novel therapy for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) combining targeted antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) and our LNC delivery technology. The goal of this collaboration is to leverage the unique attributes of our LNC technology to safely, effectively and efficiently deliver ASO intracellularly to inhibit Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat)/viral mRNA translation. Tat is a contributing factor in three major aspects of HIV infection post treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART): viral replication/latency, chronic inflammation and neurological complications. Tat is a key regulatory protein not specifically targeted by currently available ART. In vitro and in vivo studies will be conducted to determine optimal structures for incorporating ASOs into the LNC technology platform, delivery into target cells and the effective inhibition of Tat and/or viral replication while monitoring Tat-induced cytotoxicity.
 
In January 2019 we announced a research evaluation with an undisclosed top global pharmaceutical company aimed to evaluate synergistic effects of our lipid-nano-crystal (“LNC”) platform delivery technology with our partner’s nucleic acid polymer technology. Formulations will be developed using our LNC delivery technology which enables the development of a wide range of difficult-to-deliver molecules. Promising formulations will be tested in in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. For competitive reasons, the agreement stipulates certain confidential provisions, including the pharmaceutical company’s identity, the therapeutic molecule(s), the intended targets and the financial terms of the agreement.
 
Exclusive License Agreement with Rutgers University
 
Through our acquisition of Aquarius Biotechnologies Inc., we acquired a license from Rutgers University for the cochleate delivery technology. The Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement between Aquarius and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (successor in interest to the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey) provides for, among other things, (1) a license issue fee of $25,000 paid upon execution, (2) an increased equity interest in the company from 5% to 7.5% of Aquarius (prior to our acquisition of Aquarius in the Aquarius Merger), (3) royalties on a tiered basis between low single digits and the mid-single digits of net sales of products using such licensed technology, (4) a one-time sales milestone fee of $100,000 when and if sales of products using the licensed technology reach the specified sales threshold and (5) an annual license fee of initially $10,000, increasing to $50,000 over the term of the license agreement. We also agreed to assume the responsibility to pay required patent prosecution and maintenance fees covering the technology.

-18-

Unless otherwise terminated by either party, the term of the license, on a country by country basis, shall be the longer of 7-1/2 years from the date of first commercial sale of a product in a country using the licensed technology or until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent rights licensed under the agreement, whichever is longer. Rutgers has the right to terminate the license agreement if we have not commenced commercial sales of at least one product using the licensed technology within nine years of the effective date of the license agreement.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. We will seek to protect our products and associated technologies for their manufacturing and development through a combination of patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how, FDA exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. Our success will significantly depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology and inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely heavily on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
Matinas-Owned Intellectual Property Relating to MAT9001
 
We have sought patent protection in the United States and internationally for our MAT9001 discovery program, and any other inventions to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.
 
Our current patent portfolio relating to MAT9001 is comprised of two issued U.S. patents and one issued foreign patent in Australia. The issued patents cover the Company’s proprietary methods relating to triglyceride levels, total cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol or apolipoprotein C-III by administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising omega-3 fatty acids including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA). These patents provide important protection to MAT9001 through 2033. In addition, we have nineteen additional patent applications across four patent families covering the oil composition for MAT9001, other omega-3 fatty acid compositions, as well as formulations of MAT9001 and similar formulations. All of these filed patent applications also comprise methods of use of such oil compositions and formulations. Any patents that may issue from these filed United States patent applications and their counterpart international application covering the MAT9001 drug substance, formulation, and methods for use in treatment would extend protection until at least 2033.


Exclusively Licensed and Matinas-Owned Intellectual Property Relating to Our Proprietary Cochleate Delivery Technology Platform and MAT2203
 
The patents and patent applications that we exclusively license from Rutgers University provide patent protection for the proprietary chemistry technology used in our process to make our lipid nano-crystal and geodate cochleates and formulate the active pharmaceutical ingredients delivered inside this delivery technology, as in MAT2203, our lead product comprising the LNC platform delivery technology. Pursuant to our license agreement, we acquired rights to a portfolio that currently includes 11 pending applications and 22 issued U.S. and foreign patents, including 15 patents issued within the last 3 years, which extends patent protection until at least 2033. In addition, we have 28 Matinas-owned pending patent applications filed both in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions within the past 3 years. We have chosen to file these patent applications in selected foreign markets that we consider important for our product candidates. These international markets generally include Europe, China, India, Brazil, Russia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia and Mexico. These pending patent applications can extend patent protection through 2037. This patent portfolio covers our cochleate delivery system which covers a broad spectrum of technology, including amphotericin B cochleates, geodate cochleates, methods of delivering nutrients or biologically relevant molecules to a host using cochleates, cochleate vaccine compositions and protein-lipid vesicles, small interfering RNA cochleates, mRNA cochleates methods of enhancing the encochleation of hydrophilic molecules and cochleates made with low purity soy phosphatidylserine.

We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property and Regulatory Exclusivity.”
 
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our proprietary LNC technology platform as well as the manufacture of certain intermediates utilized in MAT9001, as well as our soft gelatin capsule formulation, are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 
We also plan to seek trademark protection in the United States and outside of the United States where available and when appropriate. We intend to use these registered marks in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development as well as our product candidates.
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of these companies have far greater human and financial resources and may have product candidates in more advanced stages of development and many will reach the market before our product candidates. Competitors may also develop products that are more effective, safer or less expensive or that have better tolerability or convenience.
 
MAT9001
 
Our competitors both in the United States and abroad include large, well-established pharmaceutical and generic companies, specialty and generic pharmaceutical sales and marketing companies, and specialized cardiovascular treatment companies. GlaxoSmithKline plc currently sells Lovaza®, a prescription-only omega-3 fatty acid indicated for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, which was approved by FDA in 2004 and has been on the market in the United States since 2005. Multiple generic versions of Lovaza are available in the United States. Other large companies with competitive products include AbbVie, Inc., which currently sells Tricor® and Trilipix® for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia and Niaspan®, which is primarily used to raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or HDL-C, but is also used to lower triglycerides. Multiple generic versions of Tricor, Trilipix and Niaspan are also available in the United States. In 2012, Amarin Corporation received an approval to market its prescription-only omega-3 ethyl ester called Vascepa® for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia.
 
In addition, in May 2014, Epanova® (omega-3-carboxylic acids) capsules, a free fatty acid form of omega-3 (comprised of 55% EPA and 20% DHA), was approved by the FDA for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Epanova was developed by Omthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and is now owned by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP (AstraZeneca). Also, in April 2014, Omtryg, another omega-3-acid fatty acid composition developed by Trygg Pharma AS, received FDA approval for severe hypertriglyceridemia. Neither Epanova nor Omtryg have been commercially launched, but could launch at any time. Each of these competitors, other than Trygg, has greater resources than we do, including financial, product development, marketing, personnel and other resources.

We are also aware of other pharmaceutical companies that are developing products that, if successfully developed, approved and marketed, would compete with MAT9001. Acasti Pharma, or Acasti, a subsidiary of Neptune Technologies & Bioresources Inc., announced in December 2015 that it intends to pursue a regulatory pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, for its omega-3 prescription drug candidate, CaPre® (omega-3 phospholipid), derived from krill oil, for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.
 
Akcea Therapeutics/Ionis Pharmaceuticals (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals), or Akcea/Ionis, in August 2018 announced the receipt of a complete response letter from the FDA for WAYLIVRA™ (volanesorsen), a drug candidate administered through weekly subcutaneous injections, for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). Akcea will continue to work with the FDA on the path forward for Waylivra for the treatment of FCS. Waylivra continues to be developed for the treatment of familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL).
 
In June 2018, Gemphire Therapeutics announced positive topline results from a Phase 2b trial (INDIGO-1) of its drug candidate, gemcabene, in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Gemcabene is an oral, once-daily pill for a number of hypercholesterolemic populations and severe hypertriglyceridemia.
 
Zydus Cadila has a Phase 2 development program for its lead molecule, Saroglitazar, in various indications, including severe hypertriglyceridemia in the United States. In August 2018, the Company announced that it had suspended the Phase 2 trial in the severe hypertriglyceridemia indication due to study enrollment issues, while it continues development activities in other indications. The product is approved in India under the name Lipaglyn® for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and diabetic dyslipidemia. We are also aware that bezafibrate has been licensed by Intercept Pharmaceuticals to be further developed and potentially launched in the United States market.
 
MAT2203
 
Although we believe that our proprietary LNC platform delivery technology, experience and knowledge in our areas of focus provide us with competitive advantages, these potential competitors could reduce our commercial opportunities. For many of our product candidates, we anticipate facing competition from other products that are available on a generic basis and offered at low prices. Many of these generic products have been marketed by third parties for many years and are well accepted by physicians, patients and payers.
 
We believe that MAT2203 and any other development candidate we may pursue in the future using our proprietary cochleate drug delivery technology platform, paralleled with our scientific and development expertise in the field of drug delivery, provide us with competitive advantages over our peers. However, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, as well as from generic drug manufacturers, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
 
MAT2203 will primarily compete with antifungal classes approved for the treatment of candidemia and mold infections, which include polyenes, azoles and echinocandins. The approved branded therapies for these indications include Cancidas (caspofungin, marketed by Merck & Co.), Eraxis (anidulafungin, marketed by Pfizer, Inc.), Mycamine (micafungin, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc.), Diflucan (fluconazole, marketed by Pfizer, Inc.), Noxafil (posaconazole, marketed by Merck & Co.), Vfend (voriconazole, marketed by Pfizer, Inc.), Sporanox (itraconazole, marketed by Jansen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), Cresemba (isavuconazole, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc.), Ambisome (liposomal amphotericin B, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc.) Abelcet (lipid complex amphotericin B, marketed by Sigma Tau Pharmaceuticals Inc.) and amphotericin B deoxycholate (marketed by X-Gen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). There currently are and may be more generic versions of these products available at the time of MAT2203 market approval, which will create added competition. In addition to approved therapies, we expect that MAT2203 may compete with product candidates that we are aware of in clinical development by third parties, such as SCY-078 (being developed by Scynexis, Inc.), CD101 (being developed by Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.) and certain products being developed by Viamet Pharmaceuticals Holdings, LLC, Vical Incorporated and F2G, Ltd.

Manufacturing
 
We currently contract with one third party manufacturer to supply us with certain of the intermediates used in MAT9001 and a second manufacturer to formulate a third intermediate and supply us with the final drug form. We have a third manufacturer which fills and provides our final MAT9001 capsules. If any of these manufacturers should become unavailable to us for any reason, we have identified a number of potential replacements, although we might incur some delay in qualifying such replacements. We expect to add additional suppliers and manufacturers for both the intermediates and final MAT9001 drug product as we advance MAT9001 further into clinical development.
 
We currently lease and operate in-house manufacturing capabilities for our lead LNC platform delivery technology product candidate, MAT2203, and for our LNC platform discovery programs in the gene therapy and vaccine spaces. While sufficient to produce the clinical supplies of product necessary to conduct our ongoing clinical trials and potentially early commercialization of MAT2203, we may need to expand our internal manufacturing capabilities in the future. If we are not able to retain our current manufacturing facilities and if we do not develop additional in-house manufacturing capability for our MAT2203 and product candidates sufficient to produce product for commercialization of these products, we will need to develop relationships with third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates which could be time consuming and expensive.
 
There are a number of potential third-party suppliers for amphotericin B, the generic active pharmaceutical ingredients in our lead clinical stage product candidate – MAT2203. Although to date we have not entered into formal supply agreements to secure sufficient supply of amphotericin B to support our clinical programs for MAT2203, we believe we will be able to secure supply of amphotericin B to support our clinical programs for MAT2203 and from one or more third-party suppliers. As we move through development for our product candidate, we expect to enter into long term supply arrangements for key active pharmaceutical ingredients.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We currently do not have any sales and marketing infrastructure. We plan to retain U.S. marketing and sales rights or co-promotion rights for our product candidates for which we receive marketing approvals, particularly in situations where it is possible to access the market through a focused, specialized sales force. For situations in which a large sales force is required to access the market, and with respect to markets outside the United States, we generally plan to commercialize our product candidates through collaborative arrangements with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
 
Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
 
In the United States, FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities.

Our product candidates must be approved by FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, in the case of biologic product candidates, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
 

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with FDA’s good laboratory practice, or cGLP, regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
● | preparation and submission to FDA of an NDA or BLA; 
● | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
● | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA or BLA; and 
● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by FDA. 

Nonclinical Studies
 
Nonclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of nonclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including cGLP regulations. The results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to FDA as part of an IND.
 
Companies usually must complete some long-term nonclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
Human Clinical Trials in Support of a Regulatory Approval
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by FDA, unless before that time FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.

-23-
----

 

In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to FDA in support of an NDA or IND so long as the clinical trial is conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an on-site inspection, if FDA deems it necessary.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 
Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease (e.g. cancer) or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
 
Phase 2: The drug is administered to larger number of trial participants, may be up to several hundred, who usually have the disease or condition that the experimental drug is intended to treat, to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 
Phase 3: These clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. In Phase 3 clinical trials, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 
Submission of an NDA to FDA
 
Regulatory approval for most new drug or biologic products is based on two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials that provide evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the nonclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual prescription drug program fees and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
 
FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after FDA’s receipt of the submission whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by FDA for various reasons, and for various time periods, including for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by FDA following the original submission.

Before approving an NDA, FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 
FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations
 
FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
 
Specifically, FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with FDA and FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by FDA if FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Second, in 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Improvement Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 
Third, FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.

Under Section 524 of the FDCA, FDA is authorized to award a priority review voucher to sponsors of certain tropical disease product applications that meet the criteria specified in the Act. A priority review voucher may be used by the sponsor who obtains it or it may be transferred to another sponsor who may use it to obtain priority review for a different application. Priority review vouchers can result in the acceleration of review and approval of a product candidate by up to four months. In order to be eligible for a tropical disease priority review voucher, the application must be: for a listed tropical disease; submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA or Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act after September 27, 2007; for a product that contains no active ingredient that has been approved in any other application under those statutory provisions; and must qualify for priority review. FDA has identified in guidance those product applications for the prevention or treatment of tropical diseases that may qualify for a priority review voucher.
 
Accelerated Approval Pathway
 
FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.
 
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA.
 
FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 
On the basis of FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

If FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. In addition, as a condition of approval, FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, which may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
 
FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
● | refusal of FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
 
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the nonclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.
 
Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the drug. At the same time, FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.
 
Upon approval of an ANDA, FDA indicates whether the generic product is therapeutically equivalent to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutically equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in automatic substitution of the generic drug by the pharmacist without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be submitted to FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.
 
Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30 Month Stay
 
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant submits its application to FDA, the applicant is required to certify to FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

● | the required patent information has not been filed; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------


-28-
----


● | the listed patent has expired; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 
● | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, FDA and FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 
FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which FDA cannot approve another application.
 
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting a NDA. If the request is granted, FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

-29-
----

 

If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product will be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 
21st Century Cures Act
 
On December 13, 2016, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the National Institutes of Health. The Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. In addition, the Cures Act includes provisions requiring FDA to assess and publish guidance on the use of novel clinical trial designs, the use of real world evidence in applications, the availability of summary level review for supplemental applications for certain indications, and the qualification of drug development tools. Because the Cures Act has only recently been enacted, its potential effect on our business remains unclear with the exception of a provision requiring that we post our policies on the availability of expanded access programs for individuals. Because these provisions allow FDA to spend several years developing these policies, the effect on us could be delayed.
 
With amendments to the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; and revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications.
 
Section 3042 of the Cures Act authorizes a new “Limited Population Pathway” to expedite approval of antimicrobial products intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections for which there are unmet medical needs. Drugs approved under this provision would be required to adhere to special labeling requirements, including a prominent “Limited Population” statement. Additionally, in recognition of increasing concerns about drug-resistant infections, the Act requires the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to compile a report on antimicrobial resistance by 2021, which would include a review of any effect of the new Limited Population Pathway on antibacterial or antifungal resistance. We will monitor these developments but cannot currently assess how this initiative may impact our business.
 
Other Health Care Regulations
 
Health Privacy Laws
 
We are subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., principal investigators involved in our clinical trials) ) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, (“HIPAA”). HIPAA generally requires that covered entities (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) obtain written authorizations from patients prior to disclosing protected health information of the patient (unless an exception to the authorization requirement applies). If authorization is required and the patient fails to execute an authorization or the authorization fails to contain all required provisions, then we may not be allowed access to and use of the patient’s information and our research efforts could be impaired or delayed. Furthermore, use of protected health information that is provided to us pursuant to a valid patient authorization is subject to the limits set forth in the authorization (e.g., for use in research and in submissions to regulatory authorities for product approvals). Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards, as well as the various penalties or failure to comply, directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities performing certain functions involving the creation or use of protected health information on behalf of a covered entity, or providing services to a covered entity. While we do not believe we are a “business associate” under HIPAA, regulatory agencies may disagree.

The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union, presently governed by the provisions of the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC), or the EU Directive, as implemented by the European Member States, will be replaced with the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Currently, the EU Directive establishes a regulatory framework designed to protect the security of personal data collected about residents of the EU and the movement of such personal data across the national borders of the EU Member States. The EU Directive would apply to clinical trial data we may collect about residents of the European Union. GDPR was adopted in 2016 and will become enforceable in the European Union Member States in May 2018. The GDPR will impose many new or additional requirements including, but not limited to, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the nature and scope of notifications provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and using third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. Failure to comply with the EU Directive and the GDPR, when effective, could subject us to regulatory sanctions, delays in clinical trials, criminal prosecution and/or civil fines or penalties. Additionally, GDPR creates a direct cause of action by individual data subjects. To comply with the new data protection rules imposed by the GDPR we may be required to use additional human and financial resources to come into and maintain compliance.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal prosecution, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback statute and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

Affordable Care Act
 
In late March 2010, the Federal government enacted the comprehensive health care reform package, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Among other provisions, the ACA imposes individual and employer health insurance requirements, provides certain insurance subsidies (e.g., premiums and cost sharing), mandates extensive insurance market reforms, creates new health insurance access points (e.g., State and federal-based health insurance exchanges), expands the Medicaid program, promotes research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures, and makes a number of changes to how products and services will be reimbursed by the Medicare program. Amendments to the Federal False Claims Act under the ACA have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” (whistleblower) lawsuits against companies, under which the whistleblower may be entitled to receive a percentage of any money paid to the government.
 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges and amendments to certain aspects of the ACA. There is continued uncertainty about the implementation of the ACA, including the potential for further amendments to the ACA and legal challenges to or efforts to repeal the ACA. If the ACA is repealed or further modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the ACA are delayed, such repeal, modification or delay may materially adversely impact our business, strategies, prospects, operating results or financial condition. We are unable to predict the full impact of any repeal, modification or delay in the implementation of the ACA on us at this time. Due to the substantial regulatory changes that will need to be implemented by CMS and others, and the numerous processes required to implement these reforms, we cannot predict which healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, the timing of any such reforms, or the effect such reforms or any other future legislation or regulation will have on our business.
 
Designation of and Exclusivity for Qualified Infectious Disease Products
 
In 2012, Congress passed legislation known as the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or GAIN Act. This legislation is designed to encourage the development of antibacterial and antifungal drug products that treat pathogens that cause serious and life-threatening infections. To that end, the law grants an additional five years of marketing exclusivity upon the approval of an NDA for a drug product designated by FDA as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP. Thus, for a QIDP, the periods of five year new chemical entity exclusivity, three year new clinical investigation exclusivity and seven year orphan drug exclusivity, would become 10 years, eight years, and 12 years, respectively.
 
A QIDP is defined in the GAIN Act to mean “an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by—(1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens;” or (2) certain “qualifying pathogens.” A “qualifying pathogen” is a pathogen that has the potential to pose a serious threat to public health (e.g., resistant gram positive pathogens, multi-drug resistant gram negative bacteria, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and Clostridium difficile) and that is included in a list established and maintained by FDA. A drug sponsor may request FDA to designate its product as a QIDP any time before the submission of an NDA. FDA must make a QIDP determination within 60 days of the designation request. A product designated as a QIDP will be granted priority review by FDA and can qualify for “fast track” status.
 
The additional five years of market exclusivity under the GAIN Act for drug products designated by FDA as QIDPs applies only to a drug that is first approved on or after July 9, 2012. Additionally, the five-year exclusivity extension does not apply to: a supplement to an application under Section 505(b) of the FDCA for any QIDP for which an extension is in effect or has expired; a subsequent application submitted with respect to a product approved by FDA for a change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength; or a product that does not meet the definition of a QIDP under Section 505(g) based upon its approved uses.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between the submission date of a NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with FDA.

Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 
To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
 
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
 
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 
The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
 

-33-

If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
 
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
 
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
 
Healthcare Law and Regulation
 
Healthcare providers, physicians and third party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

● | the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;

● | the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the HIPPA imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
● | HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
● | the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
● | the federal transparency requirements under the ACA requires manufacturers of drugs to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests and the reported information will be made publicly available on a searchable website; and 
● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers. 

 
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Employees
 
As of March 15, 2019, we had 15 full-time employees.
 
Research and Development
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred approximately $6.8 million and $9.0 million, respectively, on research and development activities. These expenses include cash and non-cash expenses relating to the development of our clinical and pre-clinical programs, including our anti-infective product candidates, MAT2203 and MAT2501 as well as support and enhancement of our drug delivery technology.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2019, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

For as long as we remain an “emerging growth company,” we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and financial statements in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote to approve executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”
