ITEM 1.  Business
Our Company
LendingTree, Inc. ("LendingTree", the "Company", "we" or "us") operates what we believe to be the leading online consumer platform that connects consumers with the choices they need to be confident in their financial decisions. Through multiple branded marketplaces, LendingTree empowers consumers to shop for financial services the same way they would shop for airline tickets or hotel stays, comparing multiple offers from a nationwide network of over 550 partners (which we refer to as "Network Partners") in one simple search, and choose the option that best fits their financial needs. Services include mortgage loans, mortgage refinances, home equity loans and lines of credit, reverse mortgage loans, auto loans, credit cards, deposit accounts, personal loans, student loans, small business loans, insurance quotes and other related offerings. In addition, we offer tools and resources, including free credit scores, that facilitate comparison shopping for loans, deposit products, insurance and other offerings. We seek to match consumers with multiple providers, who can offer them competing quotes for the product, or products, they are seeking. We believe our platform, consisting of a deep network of Network Partners across a broad array of financial products, differentiates us from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces which may focus on fewer product offerings or partner with fewer service providers.
Our strategically designed and executed advertising and marketing campaigns (which we refer to as performance marketing) span a wide array of digital and traditional media acquisition channels and promote our LendingTree and other brands and product offerings. Our marketing efforts are designed to attract consumers to our websites and toll-free telephone numbers. Interested consumers complete inquiry forms, providing detailed information about themselves and the loans or other offerings they are seeking. We refer to such consumer inquiries as consumer requests. We then match these consumer requests with Network Partners in our marketplace that are seeking to serve these consumers' needs. We generate revenue from our Network Partners, generally at the time of transmitting a consumer request to them, in the form of a match fee. In certain instances outside our mortgage and insurance business, we charge other kinds of fees, such as closed loan or closed sale fees. In addition to our primary consumer request data referral business, LendingTree also matches consumers with Network Partners via website clicks and calls for which partners pay either front-end or back-end fees.
We are continually working to improve the consumer experience. We have made investments in technologically-adept personnel and we use in-market real-time testing to improve our digital platforms. Additionally, we work with our Network Partners, including providing training and other resources, to improve the consumer experience throughout the process. Further, we have been building and improving our My LendingTree platform, which provides a relationship-based consumer experience, rather than just a transaction-based experience.
Evolution and Future Growth of Our Business
At its inception, our original business was to serve consumers seeking home mortgage loans by matching them with various lenders. We launched the LendingTree brand nationally in 1998 and, over the last twenty years, we invested significantly in this brand to gain widespread consumer recognition.
More recently, we have actively sought to expand the suite of financial services offerings we provide to consumers, in order to both leverage the applicability of the LendingTree brand as well as more fully serve the needs of consumers and Network Partners. We believe that consumers with existing LendingTree-branded associations will be more likely to utilize our other service offerings than those of other providers whose brands consumers may not recognize.
In June 2014, we re-launched My LendingTree, a platform that offers a personalized loan comparison-shopping experience, by providing free credit scores and credit score analysis. This platform enables us to observe consumers' credit profiles and then identify and alert them to loans and other offerings on our marketplace that may be more favorable than the terms they have at a given point in time. This is designed to provide consumers with measurable savings opportunities over their lifetimes.
By expanding our portfolio of financial services offerings, we are growing and diversifying our business and sources of revenue. We intend to capitalize on our expertise in performance marketing, product development and technology, and to leverage the widespread recognition of the LendingTree brand to effect this strategy.
We believe the consumer and small business financial services industry is still in the early stages of a fundamental shift to online product offerings, similar to the shift that started in retail and travel many years ago and is now well established. We believe that, like retail and travel, as consumers continue to move towards online shopping and transactions for financial services, suppliers will increasingly shift their product offerings and advertising budgets toward the online channel. We believe the strength of our brands and of our partner network place us in a strong position to continue to benefit from this market shift.
Recent Business Acquisitions
On January 10, 2019, we acquired Value Holding Inc., the parent company of ValuePenguin Inc. ("ValuePenguin"), a personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on a variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards. We believe that combining ValuePenguin’s high-quality content and search engine optimization capability with recently acquired proprietary technology and insurance carrier network from QuoteWizard.com, LLC ("QuoteWizard") (discussed below) enables us to provide immense value to carriers and agents. This strategic acquisition positions us to achieve further scale in the insurance space as well as the broader financial services industry.
On October 31, 2018, we acquired QuoteWizard.com, one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market. QuoteWizard services clients by driving consumers to insurance companies’ websites, providing leads to agents and carriers, as well as phone transfers of consumers into carrier call centers. We believe this acquisition will establish LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while continuing our ongoing diversification within the financial services category. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations for the Years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 - Revenue."
On July 23, 2018, we acquired Student Loan Hero, Inc. (“Student Loan Hero”), a personal finance website dedicated to helping student loan borrowers manage their student debt. Student Loan Hero offers current and former students in-depth financial comparison tools, educational resources, and unbiased, personalized advice. This strategic transaction allows us to scale our student loan business and provide consumers with the tools and resources to better understand their personal finances and make smarter financial decisions.
On June 11, 2018, we acquired Ovation Credit Services, Inc. (“Ovation”), a leading provider of credit services with a strong customer service reputation. Ovation utilizes a proprietary software application that facilitates the credit repair process and is integrated directly with certain credit bureaus while educating consumers on credit improvement via ongoing outreach with Ovation case advisors. The proprietary software application offers consumers a simple, streamlined process to identify, dispute, and correct inaccuracies within their credit reports. Ovation's experienced management team, strong credit bureau relationships and customized software platform enable us to help more consumers achieve their original financial goals through the LendingTree platform.
On September 19, 2017, we acquired certain assets of Snap Capital LLC ("SnapCap"). SnapCap is a tech-enabled online platform, which connects business owners with lenders offering small business loans, lines of credit and merchant cash advance products through a concierge-based sales approach. SnapCap's high-touch, high-conversion sales approach with our brand and performance marketing expertise has enabled growth in our small business offering.
On June 20, 2017, we acquired the membership interests of Camino Del Avion (Delaware), LLC, which does business under the name MagnifyMoney. MagnifyMoney is a leading consumer-facing media property that offers editorial content, expert commentary, tools and resources to help consumers compare financial products and make informed financial decisions. The

MagnifyMoney team brings the expertise and infrastructure to expand content creation and distribution across all of our consumer facing brands, improving our presence and efficacy in acquisition channels such as search engine optimization.
On June 14, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Deposits Online, LLC, which does business under the name DepositAccounts.com (“DepositAccounts”). DepositAccounts is a leading consumer-facing media property in the depository industry and is one of the most comprehensive sources of depository deals and analysis on the Internet, covering all major deposit product categories through editorial content, programmatic rate tables and user-generated content. This acquisition represented our first offering to address the asset side of the consumer balance sheet.
On November 16, 2016, we acquired Iron Horse Holdings, LLC, which does business under the name CompareCards. CompareCards is a leading online source for side-by-side credit card comparison shopping. CompareCards provides consumers with one centralized location for pertinent credit card information needed to find the best card for their needs. CompareCards’ unique marketing platform and strong relationships with card issuers combined with LendingTree’s scale and organizational support have delivered substantial growth in our credit card business. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations for the Years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 - Revenue."
These acquisitions continue our diversification strategy.
Products
We currently report our revenues in two product categories: (i) mortgage products and (ii) non-mortgage products. Non-mortgage products include credit cards, personal loans, home equity loans, reverse mortgage loans, auto loans, small business loans, student loans and insurance quotes. Non-mortgage products also include deposit accounts, home improvement referrals and other credit products such as credit repair and debt settlement.
Mortgage and non-mortgage product revenue is as follows (in thousands):

 | For the Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Mortgage products | $ | 242,175 | | | $ | 275,910 | | $ | 219,991
Non-mortgage products | 522,690 | | | 341,826 | | | 164,411
Total revenue | $ | 764,865 | | | $ | 617,736 | | $ | 384,402

LendingTree does not charge consumers or small businesses for the use of our services, except for credit repair services. Revenues from our mortgage products are mostly derived from upfront match fees paid by Network Partners that receive a consumer request, and in some cases upfront fees for clicks or call transfers. Because a given consumer request form can be matched with more than one Network Partner, up to five match fees may be generated from a single consumer request form. Revenues from our non-mortgage products are derived from upfront match fees paid on delivery of a consumer request, click or call and closed loan fees. For our credit card product, we send click traffic to issuers and are paid per card approval. For the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no Network Partners accounting for more than 10% of total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, one Network Partner, Quicken Loans, accounted for 11% and 15% of total revenue, respectively. Another Network Partner, loanDepot, LLC, accounted for 13% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Mortgage Products
Our mortgage products category includes our purchase and refinance products.
We partner with lenders throughout the United States to provide full geographic lending coverage and to offer a complete suite of loan offerings on our marketplace. To participate on our marketplace, lenders are required to enter into contracts with us that state the terms and conditions for such participation, although these contracts generally may be terminated for convenience by either party. We perform certain due diligence procedures on prospective new lenders, including screening against a national anti-fraud database maintained by the Mortgage Asset Research Institute, which helps manage our risk exposure. The data is utilized to determine whether a lender and its principals are eligible to participate on our marketplace and have not been convicted of and/or penalized for fraudulent activity. 
Consumers seeking mortgage loans through our loan marketplace can receive multiple conditional loan offers from participating lenders in response to a single consumer request form. We refer to the process by which we match consumers and Network Partners as the matching process. This matching process consists of the following steps:

(1) | Consumer Request. Consumers complete a single request form with information regarding the type of mortgage loan product they are seeking, loan preferences and other data. Consumers also consent to a soft inquiry regarding their credit. 

5


(2) | Consumer Request Form Matching and Transmission. Our proprietary systems and technology match a given consumer's request form data, credit profile and geographic location against certain pre-established criteria of Network Partners, which may be modified from time to time. Once a given request passes through the matching process, the request is automatically transmitted to up to five participating Network Partners. 


(3) | Lender Evaluation and Response. Network Partners that receive a consumer request form evaluate the information contained in it to determine whether to make a conditional loan offer. 


(4) | Communication of a Conditional Offer. All matched Network Partners and any conditional offers are presented to the consumer upon completion of the consumer request form. Consumers can return to the site and view their offer(s) at any time by logging in to their My LendingTree profile. Additionally, matched lenders and offers are also sent to the email address associated with the consumer request. 

We also offer consumers other mortgage products such as:

• | an alternative "short-form" matching process, which provides them with lender contact information rather than conditional offers from Network Partners, and


• | a "rate table" loan marketplace, where consumers can enter their loan and credit profile and dynamically view real-time rates from lenders without entering their contact information.

Non-Mortgage Products
Lending Products. Other lending products on our online marketplace include information, tools and access to multiple conditional loan offers for the following:

• | Auto, which includes our auto refinance and purchase loan products. Auto loans enable consumers to purchase new or used vehicles or refinance an existing loan secured by an automobile.


• | Credit cards, which include offerings from most major card issuers. As described above, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we purchased CompareCards, a leader in the online credit card comparison industry, enhancing this product.


• | Home equity loans and lines of credit, which enable home owners to borrow against the equity in their home, as measured by the difference between the market value of the home and any existing loans secured by the home. Home equity loans are one-time lump sum loans, whereas a home equity line of credit reflects a line of revolving credit where the borrower has flexibility to draw down and repay the line over time.


• | Personal loans, which are unsecured obligations generally carrying shorter terms and smaller loan amounts than home mortgages.


• | Reverse mortgage loans, which are a loan product available to qualifying homeowners age 62 or older.


• | Small business loans, which include a broad array of financing types, including but not limited to loans secured by working capital, equipment, real estate and other forms of financing, provided to small and medium-sized businesses. As described above, during the third quarter of 2017, we purchased SnapCap, an online platform with a concierge-based approach to connecting business owners with sources of credit, enhancing this product.


• | Student loans, which includes both new loans to finance an education and related expenses, as well as refinancing of existing loans. During the second quarter of 2016, we purchased SimpleTuition, a leading online marketing platform for student loans, and during the third quarter of 2018, we purchased Student Loan Hero, a personal finance website dedicated to helping student loan borrowers manage their student debt, enhancing this product.

We intend to continue adding new offerings for consumers, small businesses and partners on our online marketplace, in order to grow and diversify our sources of revenue. We may develop such new offerings through internal product development efforts, strategic business relationships with third parties and/or acquisitions.
Other Products. Other products also includes information, tools and access to the following:

• | Deposit accounts, through which consumers can access depository deals and analysis covering all major deposit product categories. On June 14, 2017, we acquired DepositAccounts.com, a leading consumer-facing media property in the depository industry and is one of the most comprehensive sources of depository deals and analysis on the Internet, covering all major deposit product categories through editorial content, programmatic rate tables and user-generated content.


• | Credit repair, through which consumers can obtain assistance improving their credit profiles, in order to expand and improve loan and other financial product opportunities available to them. During the second quarter of 2018, we purchased Ovation, a leading provider of credit services with a strong customer service reputation, enhancing this product.


• | Debt relief services, through which consumers can obtain assistance negotiating existing loans.

6


• | Home improvement services, through which consumers have the opportunity to research and find home improvement professional services.


• | Insurance products, including home and automobile, through which consumers are matched with insurance lead aggregators to obtain insurance offers. We enhanced our insurance products by acquiring QuoteWizard, one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market, in the fourth quarter of 2018. We also purchased ValuePenguin, a personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on a variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards, in the first quarter of 2019.


• | Personal credit data, through which consumers can gain insights into how prospective lenders and other third parties view their credit profiles.


• | Real estate brokerage services, through which consumers are matched with local realtors who can assist them in their home purchase or sale efforts.


• | Revenue earned through resale of online advertising space to third parties is also classified in other products.

We refer to the various purchasers of leads from our other marketplaces as lead purchasers. We generate revenue from the deposit account product from a consumer clicking from our website through to a financial institution's website. We generate revenue from insurance products through match fees, fees for website clicks or fees for calls. We generate revenue from real estate brokerage services through match fees paid to us by real estate brokers participating in our online marketplace. We generate revenue from credit repair and debt relief services through subscription fees from consumers that enroll in our credit repair product, or a fee for a customer referral to a service provider partner or through a fee at the time a consumer enrolls in a program with one of our partners. Revenue for home services is derived primarily through matching of leads to other home services lead aggregators.
Seasonality
Revenue in our lending business is subject to cyclical and seasonal trends. Home sales (and purchase mortgages) typically rise during the spring and summer months and decline during the fall and winter months, while refinancing and home equity activity is principally driven by mortgage interest rates as well as real estate values. However, in certain historical periods additional factors affecting the mortgage and real estate markets, such as the 2008-2009 financial crisis and ensuing recession have impacted customary seasonal trends.
We anticipate revenue in our newer products to be cyclical as well; however, we have limited historical data to predict the nature and magnitude of this cyclicality. Based on industry data, we anticipate that as our personal loan product matures we will experience less consumer demand during the fourth and first quarters of each year. We also anticipate less consumer demand for credit cards in the fourth quarter of each year and we anticipate higher consumer demand for deposit accounts in the first quarter of each year. The majority of consumer demand for in-school student loan products occurs in the third quarter coinciding with collegiate enrollment in late summer. Other factors affecting our businesses include macro factors such as credit availability in the market, interest rates, the strength of the economy and employment. 
Competition
Our lending and other businesses compete with other online marketing companies, including online intermediaries that operate network-type arrangements. We also face competition from lenders and insurance agents that source consumers directly. These companies typically operate consumer-branded websites and attract consumers via online banner ads, keyword placement on search engines, direct mail, television ads, retail branches, realtors, brokers, radio and other sources, partnerships with affiliates and business development arrangements with others, including major online portals.
Corporate History
LendingTree, Inc., is the parent of LendingTree, LLC and several companies owned by LendingTree, LLC. LendingTree, LLC, formerly known as LendingTree, Inc., was incorporated in the state of Delaware in June 1996 and commenced nationwide operations in July 1998. LendingTree, Inc., was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp ("IAC") in 2003 and converted to a Delaware limited liability company (LendingTree, LLC) in December 2004. LendingTree, LLC entered the mortgage origination business through the acquisition of Home Loan Center, Inc. in 2004. On August 20, 2008, LendingTree, LLC (along with its parent holding company Tree.com, Inc.) was spun off from IAC/InterActiveCorp into a separate publicly-traded company. We refer to the separation transaction as the "spin-off" in this report. Tree.com was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in April 2008 in anticipation of the spin-off. The Home Loan Center business was sold to Discover Financial Services in 2012. Since then, the Company has operated as a pure online marketplace and does not originate loans. Effective January 1, 2015, we changed our corporate name from Tree.com, Inc. to LendingTree, Inc.

As a result, we are subject to a variety of statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures in various jurisdictions in the United States, including:

Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are vital to our success. To protect our intellectual property rights in our brand, technology, products, improvements and inventions, we rely on a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, patents and other laws, and contractual restrictions on disclosure, including confidentiality agreements with strategic partners, employees, consultants and other third parties. As new or improved proprietary technologies are developed or inventions are identified, we seek patent protection in the United States and abroad, as appropriate. We have one issued U.S. patent related to the system and method for collecting financial information over a global communications network, which expires in 2032.
Many of our services are offered under proprietary trademarks and service marks. We generally apply to register or secure by contract our principal trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used. We have 28 trademarks and service marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. These registrations can typically be renewed at 10-year intervals. 
We reserve and register domain names when and where we deem appropriate and we currently have over 1,500 registered domain names. We also have agreements with third parties that provide for the licensing of patented and proprietary technology used in our business.
8

From time to time, we may be subjected to legal proceedings and claims, or threatened legal proceedings or claims, including allegations of infringement of third-party trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, the use of litigation and other dispute resolution processes, such as Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution, may be necessary for us to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 909 employees, of which approximately 892 are full-time and 17 are temporary or part-time. None of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with employees and independent contractors to be good.
