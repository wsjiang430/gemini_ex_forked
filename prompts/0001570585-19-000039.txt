Item 1.    BUSINESS
Who We Are
We are Liberty Global plc (Liberty Global), an international television and broadband company. We are focused on building a strong convergence of fixed and mobile communication opportunities and we are constantly striving to enhance and simplify our customers’ lives through quality services and products that give them the freedom to connect, converse, work and be entertained anytime, anywhere they choose.
Liberty Global has consolidated operations in 10 European countries serving 21.2 million customers in Europe at December 31, 2018. Our primary business operations are listed below, all of which we consolidate, with the exception of the VodafoneZiggo JV (defined below). As described below, our operations in Germany, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic, as well as our DTH (defined below) operations, were held for sale at December 31, 2018. In addition, we recently entered into an agreement to sell our operations in Switzerland as stated below.

Brand | Entity | Location | Ownership
 | Virgin Media | United Kingdom & Ireland | 100.0% 
 | Unitymedia | Germany | 100.0% 
 | Telenet | Belgium & Luxembourg | 59.7% 
 | UPC Holding | Switzerland, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia | 100.0% 
 | VodafoneZiggo | Netherlands | 50.0% 

General Development of Business
As a result of a series of mergers that were completed on June 7, 2013, Liberty Global became the publicly-held parent company of the successors by merger of Liberty Global, Inc. (the predecessor to Liberty Global) and Virgin Media Inc. (Virgin Media). In the following text, the terms “we”, “our”, “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) or collectively to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated, convenience translations into United States (U.S.) dollars are calculated as of December 31, 2018, and operational data, including subscriber statistics and ownership percentages, are as of December 31, 2018.
Expansion and Acquisitions
We have expanded our broadband footprint through new build projects and strategically selected acquisitions. Our new build projects consist of network extension programs pursuant to which we connect additional homes and businesses to our broadband communications network (Network Extensions). Our investment in Network Extensions is critical not only for our business to grow, but also for the countries and communities in which we operate. The Network Extensions, together with upgrades to our existing networks and next generation customer premises equipment, provide our customers the means to enter the gigaworld society. During 2018, through our Network Extensions, our continuing operations connected approximately 657,000 additional residential and commercial premises (excluding upgrades) to our two-way networks, including approximately 481,000 residential and commercial premises connected by Virgin Media in the United Kingdom (U.K.), and Ireland. We expect to continue the Network Extensions in 2019. Depending on a variety of factors, however, including the financial and operations results of our new build programs, the Network Extensions may be continued, modified or cancelled at our discretion. 
I-1

Over the past five years, we have also completed several strategic acquisitions. We made these acquisitions in order to deliver the scale that allows us to innovate effectively and invest in great content and the best products. This enables us to deliver quality services to our customers. Our significant acquisitions include:

• | On June 19, 2017, Telenet Group Holding N.V. (Telenet) acquired Coitel Brabant sprl, operating under the brand name SFR BeLux (SFR BeLux), which provided broadband operations in Belgium (Brussels and Wallonia) and Luxembourg.


• | On May 16, 2016, we acquired Cable & Wireless Communications Limited (C&W), a provider of telecommunication services, including mobile and high-speed broadband, focused in Latin America and the Caribbean. In connection with the Split-off Transaction referenced below under —Dispositions, we transferred C&W to Liberty Latin America Ltd. (Liberty Latin America).


• | On February 11, 2016, Telenet acquired BASE Company N.V. (BASE), the third-largest mobile network operator in Belgium.


• | On June 3, 2015, we acquired, together with investment funds affiliated with Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P., Choice Cable TV, a cable and broadband services provider in Puerto Rico, which was integrated into the operations of Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC. In connection with the Split-off Transaction referenced below under —Dispositions, we transferred Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC to Liberty Latin America. 


• | In November 2014, we gained control of Ziggo Holding B.V. (Ziggo), a provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services in the Netherlands, and integrated Ziggo into our Netherlands broadband operations. This business was contributed to form the VodafoneZiggo JV (defined below), a 50:50 joint venture, on December 31, 2016.

For additional information on our acquisitions see note  to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we have completed various other smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business.
Dispositions
We have completed the following dispositions during the past five years: 

• | On July 31, 2018, we completed the sale of our Austrian operations (UPC Austria) to Deutsche Telekom AG (Deutsche Telekom). In connection with the sale of UPC Austria, we have agreed to provide certain transitional services to Deutsche Telekom for a period of up to four years. These services principally comprise network and information technology-related functions.


• | On December 29, 2017, we effected the split-off of our LiLAC Group by distributing 100% of the common shares of Liberty Latin America to holders of our then LiLAC ordinary shares. The “LiLAC Group” consisted of our businesses, assets and liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean, including C&W, VTR.com SpA, a 60% interest in Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC and related cash and cash equivalents and indebtedness. Following such distribution, the LiLAC Shares were redesignated as deferred shares (with virtually no economic rights) and subsequently canceled. Also, Liberty Latin America became a separate publicly traded company.


• | On December 31, 2016, our company and Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) contributed our respective operations in the Netherlands to VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V., a 50:50 joint venture (referred to herein as the VodafoneZiggo JV). We treat the VodafoneZiggo JV as an equity investment.


• | On January 31, 2014, we sold substantially all of our programming interest held through Chellomedia B.V.

For additional information on our more recent dispositions, see note  to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have also completed various other smaller dispositions in the normal course of business and as required by regulatory authorities in connection with approving the BASE and Ziggo acquisitions.
Pending Dispositions 
On May 9, 2018, we reached an agreement (the Vodafone Agreement) to sell our operations in Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic to Vodafone. The cash proceeds that we receive from the transaction will be calculated on the basis of the agreed enterprise value adjusted for the net debt and working capital of such businesses as of the closing date of the transaction, as well as other post-closing adjustments. Based on the net debt and working capital of such businesses as of December 31, 2017, the cash proceeds would be approximately €10.6 billion ($12.1 billion). The operations of Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic are collectively referred to herein as the “Vodafone Disposal Group.” As a result of the Vodafone Agreement, 
I-2

the Vodafone Disposal Group is presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods. Unless otherwise noted, the below discussion of our business focuses on our continuing operations. 
Closing of the transaction is subject to various conditions, including regulatory approval, which we expect will be obtained in mid-2019. The Vodafone Agreement contains certain termination rights for both our company and Vodafone, including if closing has not occurred by November 9, 2019, or May 9, 2020, in certain limited circumstances. If the Vodafone Agreement terminates because the condition to obtain antitrust approval is not met, Vodafone has agreed to pay us a compensatory payment of €250.0 million ($286.3 million). In connection with the sale of the Vodafone Disposal Group, we have agreed to provide certain transitional services for a period of up to four years. These services principally comprise network and information technology-related functions. 
In addition to the Vodafone Agreement, we recently entered into an agreement to sell our direct-to-home satellite (DTH) operations, which serves customers in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania (UPC DTH). This transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to regulatory approval. 
On February 27, 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell our broadband operations in Switzerland (UPC Switzerland) to Sunrise Communications Group AG (Sunrise). Closing of this transaction is subject to regulatory approval, which is expected prior to year-end 2019, and approval by shareholders of Sunrise with respect to an associated capital increase. 
For additional information on the above pending dispositions, see notes 6 and 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information on the operations of the Vodafone Disposal Group, see Narrative Description of Business—Discontinued Operations below. 
Equity Transactions 
Pursuant to our share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors, we have repurchased a significant amount of our shares since our inception in 2005. During 2018, our share repurchases were: 

Title of shares | | Number of shares | Average price paid per share* | | Aggregate purchase price*
 | | | | | in millions 
Liberty Global Class A | 15,649,900 | | $ | 29.67 | | $ | 464.4 
Liberty Global Class C | 54,211,059 | | $ | 28.51 | | $ | 1,545.6

_______________
* Includes direct acquisition costs. 
At December 31, 2018, the remaining amount authorized for share repurchases was $566.2 million. For a further description of our share repurchases, see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Narrative Description of Business
We are a leading international telecommunications company with a commitment to providing our customers the “best in class” communications and entertainment services. These services are delivered to our residential and business customers over our networks and include video, broadband internet, telephony and mobile services. We deliver mobile services over our own networks and through third-party networks as MVNOs. We design our services to enable our customers to access the digital world on their own terms and at their own pace. In most of our footprint, the core of our offer is “triple-play”, which we use to describe bundled services of digital video, internet and telephony in one subscription. We are enhancing this offer by expanding our services to include mobile services for a “quad-play” or fixed-mobile convergence service in most of our markets. Available service offerings depend on the bandwidth capacity of a particular system and whether it has been upgraded for two-way communications. In certain markets, we also offer video services through fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) networks. 
Our continuing operations provide residential and business telecommunication services in the U.K. and Ireland through Virgin Media, Belgium through Telenet, and Switzerland, Poland and Slovakia through our subsidiary UPC Holding B.V. (UPC Holding). In terms of video subscribers, we operate the largest cable network in each of these countries. We also have investments in the VodafoneZiggo JV, which operates the largest cable network in the Netherlands, and in various content businesses. In addition, we currently own and manage the operations of the Vodafone Disposal Group, consisting of television and broadband services in Germany through Unitymedia GmbH (Unitymedia) and in Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic through UPC Holding, and the DTH operations under UPC DTH.
A breakdown of our revenue by major category for our consolidated reportable segments appears in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 In connecting our customers through our telecommunication services, we recognize that we are a global corporate citizen and that we play a role in addressing the environmental impacts generated through our business. By seeking to address these issues, we strengthen our company and positively influence the communities in which we operate. This includes enhancing the energy efficiency of all our operations, with a focus on energy use, carbon emissions and management of electronic waste. We also recognize that coding skills are essential to our industry and other technology-based jobs of the future. As a result, we have partnered with the CoderDojo Foundation, a global community of free coding clubs for children age 7-17. Our support for CoderDojo is enabling the next generation of creators, improving their long-term career prospects. We are also working with European Schoolnet to raise awareness of teachers on educational resources available for them to help address online issues teenagers are facing. Corporate responsibility is a key part of our business.

__________________

(1) | Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially extending the distribution plant, except for DTH homes. Certain of our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. We do not count homes passed for DTH. Due to the fact that we do not own the partner networks (defined below) used in Switzerland (see note 10 below), we do not report homes passed for Switzerland’s partner networks.


(2) | Two-way Homes Passed are Homes Passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way services, including video, internet and telephony services.


(3) | Cable Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or telephony services that we count as Revenue Generating Units (RGUs), without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. Cable Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two Cable Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Cable Customer Relationships.


(4) | RGU is separately a Basic Video Subscriber, Enhanced Video Subscriber, DTH Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber (each as defined and described below). A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer in our U.K. market subscribed to our enhanced video service, fixed-line telephony service and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Basic Video, Enhanced Video, DTH, Internet and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers or free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our December 31, 2018 RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.


(5) | Basic Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network either via an analog video signal or via a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Encryption-enabling technology includes smart cards, or other integrated or virtual technologies that we use to provide our enhanced service offerings. We count RGUs on a unique premises basis. In other words, a subscriber with multiple outlets in one premises is counted as one RGU and a subscriber with two homes and a subscription to our video service at each home is counted as two RGUs. In Europe, we have approximately 194,600 “lifeline” customers that are counted on a per connection basis, representing the least expensive regulated tier of video cable service, with only a few channels.


(6) | Enhanced Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network or through a partner network via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Enhanced Video Subscribers are counted on a unique premises basis. For example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises is generally counted as just one subscriber. An Enhanced Video Subscriber is not counted as a Basic Video Subscriber. As we migrate customers from basic to enhanced video services, we report a decrease in our Basic Video Subscribers equal to the increase in our Enhanced Video Subscribers. Subscribers to enhanced video services provided by our operations in Switzerland over partner networks receive basic video services from the partner networks as opposed to our operations.


(7) | DTH Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming broadcast directly via a geosynchronous satellite.


(8) | Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. In Switzerland, we offer a 2 Mbps internet service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Internet Subscribers in Switzerland include 76,300 subscribers who have requested and received this service.


(9) | Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. In Switzerland, we offer a basic phone service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony Subscribers in Switzerland include 149,500 subscribers who have requested and received this service.


(10) | Pursuant to service agreements, Switzerland offers enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony services over networks owned by third-party cable operators (“partner networks”). A partner network RGU is only recognized if there is a direct billing relationship with the customer. At December 31, 2018, Switzerland’s partner networks account for 126,200 Customer Relationships, 298,400 RGUs, 107,000 Enhanced Video Subscribers, 109,000 Internet Subscribers, and 82,400 Telephony Subscribers.


(11) | Our Mobile Subscriber count represents the number of active subscriber identification module (SIM) cards in service rather than services provided. For example, if a Mobile Subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one Mobile

I-8

Subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop (via a dongle) would be counted as two Mobile Subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our Mobile Subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country. In a number of countries, our Mobile Subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. As of December 31, 2018, our Mobile Subscriber count included 489,400 and 376,700 prepaid Mobile Subscribers in Belgium and the U.K., respectively. 
Additional General Notes to Table:
Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other business services. Certain of our business service revenue is derived from small or home office (SOHO) subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. To the extent our existing customers upgrade from a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. With the exception of our business SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of business services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.
In Germany, homes passed reflect the footprint and two-way homes passed reflect the technological capability of our network up to the street cabinet, with drops from the street cabinet to the building generally added, and in-home wiring generally upgraded, on an as needed or success-based basis. In Belgium, Telenet leases a portion of its network under a long-term capital lease arrangement. These tables include operating statistics for Telenet’s owned and leased networks. 
While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (1) the nature and pricing of products and services, (2) the distribution platform, (3) billing systems, (4) bad debt collection experience and (5) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews. 
Subscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.

Products and Services
Video Services
Our video service is, and continues to be, one of the key foundations of our product offerings in our markets. Our cable operations offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services starting with a basic video service. Subscribers to our basic video service pay a fixed monthly fee and receive digital or analog video channels (including a limited number of high definition (HD) channels) and several digital and analog radio channels and an electronic programming guide. In Poland where our basic digital service is unencrypted, the cost of our digital service is the same cost as the monthly fee of our analog service. In the markets where we encrypt our basic digital service, our digital service is generally offered at an incremental cost equal to or slightly higher than the monthly fee for our basic analog service. We tailor our video services in each country of operation based on programming preferences, culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements. 
We also offer a variety of premium channel packages to meet the special interests of our subscribers. For an additional monthly charge, a subscriber may upgrade to one of our extended digital tier services and receive an increased number of video and radio channels, including the channels in the basic tier service and additional HD channels. Digital subscribers may also subscribe to one or more packages of premium channels for an additional monthly charge. Our channel offerings include general entertainment, sports, movies, documentaries, lifestyles, news, adult, children and ethnic and foreign channels. 
Subscribers to our digital services also receive the channels available through our analog service. We offer limited analog video services in all of our broadband markets, except in the U.K. and Switzerland. In all of our broadband operations, we continue to upgrade our systems to expand our digital services and encourage our analog subscribers to convert to a basic digital or premium digital service.
Discounts to our monthly service fees are available to any subscriber who selects a bundle of two or more of our services (bundled services): video, internet, fixed-line telephony and, in most of our markets, mobile services. Bundled services consist of double-play for two services, triple-play for three services and, where available, quad-play for four services. 
To meet customer demands, we have enhanced our video services with various products that enable our customers to control when, where and how they watch their programming. These products range from digital video recorders (DVRs) to multimedia home gateway systems such as "Horizon TV", as well as various mobile applications (apps). Horizon TV is a next generation multimedia home gateway (decoder box) based on a digital television platform that is capable of distributing video, voice and data content throughout the home and to multiple devices. It has a sophisticated user interface that enables customers to view and share, across multiple devices, linear channels, video-on-demand (VoD) programming and personal media content and to pause, replay and record programming. The Horizon TV gateway can act as an internet router that allows access to digital video content available on the television via other devices, such as laptops, smart phones and tablets. 
In 2018, we introduced our latest set top box, often referred to by its project name “Eos”, in Switzerland. The Eos set top box is capable of delivering ultra-high definition 4K and enhanced high dynamic range or HDR video content. It carries the next generation Horizon TV user interface that we call “Horizon 4”. Horizon 4 is a multiscreen platform that combines linear television, VoD and mobile viewing. In addition to the features of Horizon TV, Horizon 4 allows customers to pause a program, series or movie and seamlessly continue watching from where they left off on another device, whether a television, tablet, smart phone or laptop. Customers also have access to cloud storage for up to 2,000 hours of recording, as well as our Repay TV service (described below). Customers can control their Eos set-top box with voice commands using the accompanying remote control. Horizon 4 is marketed under the name “UPC TV” in Switzerland, and it will be launched in other markets over the course of 2019, where it will be marketed under different brand names. 
For our Horizon TV and Horizon 4 subscribers, we offer various features and functionalities, including television apps for various online services (such as YouTube, Netflix, social platforms, sports experience, music, news and games). In almost all of our operations, we also offer an online mobile app for viewing on a second screen that is based on our “Horizon Go” platform. Horizon Go is available on mobile devices (iOS, Android and Windows) and via an internet portal and allows video customers to view linear channels, VoD and Replay TV, with a substantial part of this content available outside of the home. In a number of markets, Horizon Go also has a “Download to Go” feature that allows the consumer to take content with them on their device. For Horizon TV and Horizon 4 customers, when in the home the second screen device can act as a remote control. Through Horizon Go, customers have the ability to remotely schedule the recording of a television program on their Horizon TV or Horizon 4 box at home. 
We offer Horizon TV in Switzerland, Ireland and Poland. In most of our other European operations, we provide a Horizon TV-like experience through a remotely upgraded version of the software on the customer’s set-top box. After the upgrade, these boxes offer several features of the Horizon TV product. We refer to this upgrade as “Horizon Lite”, although it is locally marketed 
I-12

as Horizon TV, except in Belgium where it is marketed as “Digital TV”. Some of the Horizon TV features are not available on our Horizon Lite systems, such as recommendation-based content and the ability to access video content on other devices in the home. We intend to continue to improve the Horizon TV user experience with new functionality and software updates. 
In the U.K., we offer a multimedia home gateway based on the TiVo platform under a strategic partnership agreement with TiVo Inc.  Through the TiVo platform, we offer our U.K. customers a basic set-top box or the Virgin Media V6 box. Both boxes provide television and broadband internet capabilities. Similar to Horizon 4, the Virgin Media V6 box combines ultra high-definition 4K video, including high dynamic range, with improved streaming functionalities and more processing power. The Virgin Media V6 box allows customers to record six channels simultaneously while watching a seventh. Customers can also start watching programming on one television and pick up where they left off on other TiVo boxes in another room or through an app on their smart phones and tablets. Over 50% of our U.K. customers have the Virgin Media V6 box. In addition to the video service on their TiVo gateway device, our customers in the U.K. also have access to a comprehensive internet streaming video service called “Virgin TV Go”. This service, which is available via a mobile app or an internet portal, allows our video customers to stream real-time TV channels and watch VoD content anywhere they have an internet connection. Our enhanced video customers can also download certain on-demand programs to their compatible devices for off-line viewing via the Virgin TV Go app. 
In Belgium, Telenet is planning to deploy Horizon 4 in 2019, as well as an enhanced multiscreen service based on Horizon Go. Its current digital video product “Digital TV” functions similar to our Horizon Lite service. Telenet also offers customers access to live TV streaming and various other content sources such as VoD via its “Yelo Play” app, which is available via iOS, Android and Windows smart phones and tablets. Digital TV set-top boxes and Yelo Play offer a Horizon TV-like user interface that allow Telenet's enhanced video customers to remotely manage their DVR, view programs remotely (up to seven days after the original broadcast) and access VoD with a laptop, smart phone or tablet in or out of the home. 
One of our key video services is “Replay TV”. Replay TV records virtually all programs across numerous linear channels in the countries where this service is available. The recordings are available up to seven days after the original broadcast. This allows our customers to catch up on their favorite television shows without having to set their DVR or browse separate menus on their set-top boxes. Instead, customers can open the electronic programing guide, scroll back and replay linear programming instantly. Replay TV also allows our customers to replay a television program from the start even while the live broadcast is in progress. Replay TV is one of the most used and appreciated features on our platforms. It is accessible in all of our markets, except in the U.K., through our Horizon services, and in some of our markets also via Horizon Go. 
In most of our markets, we offer transactional VoD giving subscribers access to thousands of movies and television series. In several of our markets, our subscription VoD service is included in our enhanced video services accessed through the Horizon TV platform. This service is tailored to the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and competitive offers and includes various programming, such as music, kids, documentaries, adult, sports and TV series. In Belgium, the service is marketed as “Play” and “Play More”. We continue to develop our VoD services to provide a growing collection of programming from local and international suppliers, such as ABC/Disney, A+E Networks, NBC/Universal, CBS/Paramount, Discovery, the BBC, Warner and Sony, among others. Customers who subscribe to an extended digital tier generally receive a VoD enabled set-top box without an additional monthly charge. 
Subscribers access our enhanced video service by renting a set-top box with a smart card from our operators, or without a set-top box if a subscriber is only using our basic video service. Where Horizon TV is available, a subscriber to our enhanced video services has the option, for an incremental monthly charge, to upgrade the standard digital set-top box to a Horizon TV box or Horizon 4 for our Switzerland customers (both of which have HD DVR capabilities and other additional features). No set-top box or smart card, however, is required to receive our basic digital services in our unencrypted footprint in Poland. In addition, expanded channel packages and premium channels and services are available for an incremental monthly fee in all of our markets.
WiFi and Internet Services
Connectivity is a building block for vibrant communities. Our fiber-rich broadband network is the backbone of our business and the basis of our connectivity strategy. To meet our customers’ expectations to be seamlessly connected, we are investing in the expansion of our broadband network, mobile and WiFi solutions and customer premises equipment.
Internet speed is of crucial importance to our customers, as they spend more time streaming video and other bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. Our extensive broadband network enables us to deliver ultra high-speed internet service across our markets. Our residential subscribers access the internet via cable modems connected to their internet capable devices, or wirelessly via a WiFi gateway device. We offer multiple tiers of broadband internet service ranging from a basic service of 50 Mbps in Slovakia to an ultra high-speed internet service of 500 Mbps in Switzerland, Poland and Slovakia. 
I-13

The speed of service depends on the location and the tier of service selected. In addition, by leveraging our existing fiber-rich broadband networks and our Network Extensions, we are in position to deliver gigabit services by deploying the next generation DOCSIS 3.1 technology. In 2018, we launched this technology in Warsaw, Poland. Customers in Warsaw may subscribe to our ultra high-speed internet service of 1 Gbps. We intend to expand this technology in additional markets in 2019. By using DOCSIS 3.1, we can extend our download speeds to at least 1 Gbps where deployed. DOCSIS 3.1 technology improves not only our internet speed offers but also to allows for network growth. DOCSIS technology is an international standard that defines the requirements for data transmission over a cable system. Currently, our ultra high-speed internet service is based primarily on DOCSIS 3.0 technology. 
Our internet service generally includes email, address book and parental controls. We offer value-added broadband services in certain of our markets for an incremental charge. These services include security (e.g., anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall and spam protection) and online storage solutions and web spaces. In many of our markets, we offer mobile broadband services with internet access as described below. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee based on the tier of service selected. In addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon subscribing to an internet service. This one-time fee may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of speed, market conditions and other factors. 
Our "Connect Box" is a dedicated connectivity device that delivers superior in-home WiFi coverage. It is our next generation WiFi and telephony gateway that enables us to maximize the impact of our ultrafast broadband networks by providing reliable wireless connectivity anywhere in the home. It has an automatic WiFi optimization function, which selects the best possible wireless frequency at any given time. This gateway can be self-installed and allows customers to customize their home WiFi service. Our Connect Box is available in all our markets and currently over 60% of our customers have a Connect Box. In addition to our markets, we distribute Connect Box to other markets in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, connecting almost 12 million homes. Robust wireless connectivity is increasingly important with our customers spending more and more time using bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. In Belgium, Switzerland and the U.K., we also offer a connect app that allows our customers to find their best WiFi access. In addition, WiFi boosters are available in all our markets to optimize connectivity. We are also moving forward to bring to market our new Gigabit Connect Box based on DOCSIS 3.1 technology that will provide even better in-home WiFi service to customers. 
In all of our markets, we have deployed community WiFi via routers in the home (the Community WiFi), which provides a secure access to the internet for our customers. Community WiFi is enabled by a cable modem WiFi access point (WiFi modem) in the Connect Box, the set-top box or a Horizon box of our internet customers. The Community WiFi is created through the sharing of access to the public channel of our customers’ home wireless routers. The public channel is a separate network from the secure private network used by the customer within the home and is automatically enabled when the WiFi modem is installed. Public WiFi access points (covering train stations, hotels, bars, restaurants and other public places) are also available for no additional cost.
Mobile Services
Mobile services are another key building block for us to provide customers with seamless connectivity. We offer mobile services as an MVNO over third-party networks in the U.K., Switzerland, Ireland and Poland. Following the February 2016 acquisition of BASE, Telenet became a mobile network provider in Belgium. Where appropriate, we will add MVNO arrangements or acquire or partner with mobile service providers with their own networks in all our broadband communication markets. 
In Switzerland and Ireland, we provide our mobile telephony services as full MVNOs through partnerships with a third-party mobile network operator in their respective footprints of our country operations. These operations lease the third-party’s radio access network and own the core network, including switching, backbone and interconnections. These arrangements permit us to offer our customers in these markets mobile services without having to build and operate a cellular radio tower network. In 2017, our mobile operations in the U.K. moved from a light MVNO to a full MVNO arrangement due to a revised agreement with the third-party network provider. The migration of our U.K. mobile customers to the full MVNO arrangement is expected to be completed in 2019. In Poland, we provide mobile telephony as a light MVNO to certain legacy subscribers. In this case, we lease the core network as well as the radio access network from a mobile network operator. This arrangement permits our Poland customers to have access to the third-party mobile communications services while we maintain the customer relationship. We plan to launch a new mobile service in Poland as a full MVNO in mid-2019. 
I-14

Our MVNO partners are:

Country | Partner 
U.K. | EE 
Switzerland | Swisscom (1) 
Ireland | Three (Hutchison)
Poland | Orange/Play 

____________
(1) Our Switzerland operations migrated to the Swisscom AG (Swisscom) network the beginning of 2019.

Where mobile services are available, subscribers pay varying monthly fees depending on whether the mobile service is combined with our cable services or includes mobile data services via mobile phones, tablets or laptops. We offer our customers the option to purchase mobile handsets and, in most of our markets, make such purchase pursuant to a contract independent of their mobile services contract. We refer to these arrangements as split contracts. In Belgium, for those subscribers on Telenet’s own network, it is offering more flexible bundles adjusted to customers’ needs so they can use the full capacity of their package, regardless of their appetite to use either more data, minutes or text messages. As a mobile network provider, Telenet also has agreements with other mobile providers to use its mobile network for their mobile offerings. 
Our mobile services typically include voice, short message service (or SMS) and internet access. Calls, both within and out of network, incur a charge or are covered under a postpaid monthly service plan. Our mobile services are primarily on a postpaid basis with customers subscribing to services for periods ranging from activation for a SIM-only contract to up to 24 months (or 36 months in the U.K.), with the latter often taken with a subsidized mobile handset. In Belgium and Switzerland, however, our postpaid service is offered without a minimum contract term. In the U.K. and Belgium, we also offer a prepaid service, where the customers pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime or data and generally have no minimum contract term. In almost all of our markets, subscribers to a double- or triple-play bundle receive a discount on their mobile service fee. 
Telephony Services
Multi-feature telephony services are available through voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) technology in most of our broadband communication markets. In the U.K., we also provide traditional circuit-switched telephony services. We pay interconnect fees to other telephony and internet providers when calls by our subscribers terminate on another network and receive similar fees from providers when calls by their users terminate on our network through interconnection points. 
Our telephony service may be selected in several of our markets on a standalone basis and in all of our markets in combination with one or more of our other services. Our telephony service includes a basic fixed-line telephony product for line rental and various calling plans, which may consist of any of the following: unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. We also offer value added services, such as a personal call manager, unified messaging and a second or third phone line at an incremental cost. 
Multiple Dwelling Units and Partner Networks
Pursuant to an agreement executed on June 28, 2008 (the PICs Agreement) with four associations of municipalities in Belgium (the pure intercommunales or PICs), Telenet leases the PICs broadband communications network and, accordingly, makes its services available to all of the homes passed by the cable network owned by the PICs. Telenet has a direct customer relationship with the basic and enhanced video subscribers on the PICs network. Pursuant to the PICs Agreement, Telenet has full rights to use substantially all of the PICs network under a long-term capital lease. Unless extended, the PICs Agreement will expire on September 23, 2046, and cannot be terminated earlier (except in the case of non-payment or bankruptcy of Telenet). For additional information on the PICs Agreement, see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For over half of the basic video subscribers of UPC Switzerland, UPC Switzerland maintains billing relationships with landlords or housing associations and provides basic video service to the tenants. The landlord or housing association administers the billing for the basic video service with their tenants and manages service terminations for their rental units. When tenants select triple-play bundles with or without mobile service from UPC Switzerland, they then migrate to a direct billing relationship with us.
UPC Switzerland offers enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony services directly to the video cable subscribers of those partner networks that enter into service operating contracts with UPC Switzerland. UPC Switzerland has the direct customer billing relationship with these subscribers. By permitting UPC Switzerland to offer some or all of its enhanced video, broadband 
I-15

internet and telephony products directly to those partner network subscribers, UPC Switzerland’s service operating contracts have expanded the addressable markets for UPC Switzerland’s digital products. In exchange for the right to provide digital products directly to the partner network subscribers, UPC Switzerland pays to the partner network a share of the revenue generated from those subscribers. UPC Switzerland also provides network maintenance services and engineering and construction services to its partner networks.
Business Services
In addition to our residential services, we offer business services in all of our operations. For business and public sector organizations, we provide a complete range of voice, advanced data, video, wireless and cloud-based services, as well as mobile and converged fixed-mobile services. Our business customers include SOHO (generally up to five employees), small business and medium and large enterprises. We also provide business services on a wholesale basis to other operators. 
Our business services are designed to meet the specific demands of our business customers with a wide range of services, including increased data transmission speeds and virtual private networks. These services fall into five broad categories: 

• | VoIP and circuit-switch telephony, hosted private branch exchange solutions and conferencing options;


• | data services for internet access, virtual private networks and high capacity point-to-point services;


• | wireless services for mobile voice and data, as well as managed WiFi networks;


• | video programming packages and select channel lineups for targeted industries; and


• | value added services, including webhosting, managed security systems and storage and cloud enabled software.

Our intermediate to long-term strategy is to enhance our capabilities and offerings in the business sector so we become a preferred provider in the business market. To execute this strategy, customer experience and strategic marketing play a key role.
Our business services are provided to customers at contractually established prices based on the size of the business, type of services received and the volume and duration of the service agreement. SOHO and small business customers pay business market prices on a monthly subscription basis to receive enhanced service levels and business features that support their needs. For more advanced business services, these customers generally enter into a service agreement. For medium to large business customers, we enter into individual agreements that address their needs. These agreements are generally for a period of at least one year. 
Investments—VodafoneZiggo JV
We own a 50% interest in the VodafoneZiggo JV, which is a leading Dutch company that provides fixed, mobile and integrated communication and entertainment services to consumers and businesses in the Netherlands. In connection with the formation of the VodafoneZiggo JV, we entered into a shareholders agreement with Vodafone providing for the governance of the VodafoneZiggo JV, including decision-making process, information access, dividend policy and non-compete provisions. It also provides for restrictions on transfer of interests in the VodafoneZiggo JV and exit arrangements. Under the dividend policy, the VodafoneZiggo JV is required to distribute all unrestricted cash to Vodafone and us, subject to minimum cash requirements and financing arrangements. We also entered into a framework agreement with the VodafoneZiggo JV to provide access to each partner’s expertise in the telecommunications business. For additional information on the above agreements, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The fiber-rich broadband network of the VodafoneZiggo JV passes 7.2 million homes. The VodafoneZiggo JV also offers nationwide mobile coverage. At December 31, 2018, the VodafoneZiggo JV had 9.7 million RGUs of which 3.9 million were video, 3.3 million were fixed broadband internet and 2.5 million were fixed-line telephony. In addition, the VodafoneZiggo JV had 5.0 million mobile (including 0.8 million prepaid) customers. Besides its residential services, the VodafoneZiggo JV offers extensive business services throughout the Netherlands. The operations of the VodafoneZiggo JV are subject to various regulations, which are described below under Regulatory Matters—The Netherlands. 
The VodafoneZiggo JV’s customers continue to have access to Horizon TV and its functionalities (marketed as “Ziggo TV”), including Replay TV, the Ziggo Go app, pause live TV and VoD, 400 Mbps nationwide broadband internet and an extensive WiFi Community network. The VodafoneZiggo JV also has its own sports channel, Ziggo Sport, and offers exclusive programming, such as HBO. Approximately 1.2 million customers use the Connect Box for their in-home WiFi service. They also have access to Vodafone’s nationwide long-term evolution wireless service, also called “4G” (referred to herein as LTE) services, under either a prepaid or postpaid service plan. The VodafoneZiggo JV provides its mobile services under various licenses. The license for its 3G services expires in 2020. The bandwidth under this license will be re-auctioned in late 2019. With its mobile services, the VodafoneZiggo JV is able to offer quad-play bundles and converged services to its residential and business customers.
I-16

For all its services, the VodafoneZiggo JV competes primarily with the provision of similar services from the incumbent telecommunications operator Koninklijke KPN N.V. (KPN). KPN offers (1) internet protocol television (IPTV) over fiber optic lines where the fiber is to the home, cabinet, or building or to the node networks (fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-building/-node is referred to herein as FTTx) and through broadband internet connections using digital subscriber lines (DSL) or very high-speed DSL technology (VDSL) or an enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring”, (2) digital terrestrial television (DTT), and (3) LTE services. Where KPN has enhanced its VDSL system, it offers broadband internet with download speeds of up to 200 Mbps and on its FTTx networks, it offers download speeds of up to 500 Mbps. Its ability to offer a bundled triple-play of video, broadband internet and telephony services and fixed-mobile convergence services creates significant competitive pressure on the VodafoneZiggo JV’s operations, including the pricing and bundling of its video products. KPN’s video services include many of the interactive features that the VodafoneZiggo JV offers its subscribers, including pausing live TV, replay and third party apps. Portions of the VodafoneZiggo JV’s network have been overbuilt by KPN’s and other providers’ FTTx networks and expansion of these networks is expected to continue. Another significant competitor is the Netherlands operations of Deutsche Telekom. 
Discontinued Operations 
We currently own and manage the Vodafone Disposal Group operations (Germany, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic). On May 9, 2018, we entered into an agreement with Vodafone pursuant to which Vodafone would acquire the Vodafone Disposal Group, subject to various conditions. We expect the disposition of the Vodafone Disposal Group to be completed in mid-2019 and, accordingly, we have reported it as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. Below is a description of the Vodafone Disposal Group business in 2018. 
The Vodafone Disposal Group consists of, in terms of video subscribers, the largest cable network in each of the Czech Republic and Hungary and the second largest cable network in each of Germany and Romania. In each of these operations, the core offer is triple-play services. Customers who subscribe to triple play services or double-play services receive a discount to their monthly service fees. The broadband network of the Vodafone Disposal Group passes 19.7 million homes. The operations in Germany and Hungary also offer mobile services. In addition to the residential services, each of the operations in the Vodafone Disposal Group offers business services in their respective countries. 
The Vodafone Disposal Group cable operations offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services starting with a basic video service. In each market, the basic digital service is unencrypted. Extended digital tiers are available for an additional monthly charge and include additional video and radio channels, including those in the basic tier services, and additional HD channels. Vodafone Disposal Group customers have access to Horizon TV or Horizons Lite, depending on location, Horizon Go and, except in Germany, Replay TV. The operations have an extensive WiFi Community network, and the maximum broadband speeds available are 400 Mbps in Germany and 500Mbps in the other countries. In addition, up to 1 Gbps is available in select cities of Germany. Through MVNO arrangements, customers in Germany and Hungary have access to LTE services and postpaid service plans. With these mobile services, the German and Hungarian operations are able to offer quad-play bundles and converged services to residential and business customers. 
Approximately two-thirds of Unitymedia’s video customers are in multiple dwelling units where Unitymedia has the billing relationship with the landlord or housing association or with a third-party (Professional Operator) that operates and administers the in-building network on behalf of housing associations. Many of these agreements, such as the one with Tele Columbus Multimedia GmbH, allow Unitymedia to market its digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services directly to the Professional Operator’s subscriber base. Professional Operators may procure the basic video signals from Unitymedia at volume-based discounts and will generally resell them to housing associations with whom the operator maintains the customer relationship. 
Unitymedia has entered into various long-term agreements with the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom for the lease of cable duct space and hubs, as well as use of fiber optic transmission systems, towers and facility space. In addition, Unitymedia purchases a portion of the electricity required for the operation of its networks through Deutsche Telekom under such agreements. Unitymedia’s ability to offer its broadband communications services to customers is dependent on the agreements with Deutsche Telekom. These agreements are long-term and may only be terminated under certain limited exceptions. Any termination, however, would have a material adverse effect on the operations of Unitymedia. For information on a legal action that Unitymedia commenced against Deutsche Telekom’s affiliate in December 2012 regarding these agreements, see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Additional Business Information
Technology 
In most of our markets, our video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services are transmitted over a hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. This network is composed primarily of national and regional fiber networks, which are connected to the home over the last few hundred meters by coaxial cable. Over 99% of our network allows for two-way communications and is flexible enough to support our current services as well as new services. 
We closely monitor our network capacity and customer usage. Where necessary, we increase our capacity incrementally, for instance by splitting nodes in our cable network. We also continue to explore improvements to our services and new technologies that will enhance our customer’s connected entertainment experience. These actions include:

• | recapturing bandwidth and optimizing our networks by:


◦ | increasing the number of nodes in our markets;


◦ | increasing the bandwidth of our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network to 1 GHz;


◦ | converting analog channels to digital;


◦ | bonding additional DOCSIS 3.0 channels;


◦ | replacing copper lines with modern optic fibers; and


◦ | using digital compression technologies.


• | freeing spectrum for high-speed internet, VoD and other services by encouraging customers to move from analog to digital services;


• | increasing the efficiency of our networks by moving headend functions (encoding, transcoding and multiplexing) to cloud storage systems;


• | enhancing our network to accommodate business services;


• | using wireless technologies to extend our services outside of the home;


• | offering remote access to our video services through laptops, smart phones and tablets;


• | expanding the availability of Horizon TV and Virgin TV Go, as well as Horizon 4, and related products and developing and introducing online media sharing and streaming or cloud-based video; and


• | testing new technologies.

As stated under General Development of Business—Expansion and Acquisitions above, we are expanding our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network through our Network Extensions. In addition, we are seeking mobile service opportunities where we have established cable networks and expanding our fixed-line networks where we have a strong mobile offering. This will allow us to offer converged fixed-line and mobile services to our customers. 
We deliver high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our broadband network in our markets. The cable networks of our operations in Europe are connected to our “Aorta” backbone. The Aorta backbone is recognized as a Tier 1 Carrier, which permits us to serve our customers through settlement free collaboration with other carriers without the cost of using a third-party network. 
In support of our connectivity strategy, we are moving our customers into a gigabit society. Almost all of our broadband networks are already capable of supporting the next generation of ultra high-speed internet service at gigabit speeds. To provide these speeds to our subscribers, we are launching our next generation gateways that will enable DOCSIS 3.1 technology throughout our footprint. The use of DOCSIS 3.1 technology will provide us significantly higher efficiencies on our networks and allow us to offer faster speeds, in-home WiFi and better services. The new gateways and the continued upgrades to our network in the coming years will allow us to maximize high-speed connectivity over our broadband networks and deliver gigabit services in a cost-effective manner. It will also allow us to meet the expectations of our customers for high-speed internet access both in cities and rural areas of our footprint.

Supply Sources
Content. With telecommunication companies increasingly offering similar services, content is one of the deciding factors for customers in selecting a video services provider. Therefore, in addition to providing services that allow our customers to view programming when and where they want, we are investing in content that customers want. Our content strategy is based on: 

• | proposition (exceeding our customers' entertainment desires and expectations);


• | product (delivering the best content available);


• | procurement (investment in the best brands, shows and sports); and


• | partnering (strategic alignment, acquisitions and growth opportunities).

We license almost all of our programming and on-demand offerings from content providers and third-party rights holders, including broadcasters and cable programming networks. Under our distribution agreements, we generally pay a monthly fee on a per channel or per subscriber basis, with occasional minimum pay guarantees. For on-demand programming, we generally pay a revenue share for transactional VoD and a flat fee for subscription VoD. We generally enter into long-term programming licenses with volume discounts and marketing support. For a majority of our agreements, we seek to include the rights to offer the licensed programming to our customers through multiple delivery platforms and through our apps for smart phones and tablets. 
In seeking licenses for content, our primary focus is on partnering with leading international providers, such as Disney, Time Warner (including HBO), Fox, the BBC and Discovery. We also seek to carry in each of our markets key public and private broadcasters and in some markets we acquire local premium programing through select relationships with companies such as Sky plc (Sky) (U.K. and Ireland) and BT Group plc (BT). For our VoD services, we license a variety of programming, including box sets of television series, movies, music, kids and documentaries. In addition, we currently have an arrangement with Netflix Inc. (Netflix) to provide access to Netflix for our customers with premium over-the-top (OTT) services. Through this arrangement, the Netflix content is available via set-top boxes to our video customers across many of our markets. The Netflix app is available to our customers in the U.K., Ireland and Switzerland. It is also available to the VodafoneZiggo JV’s customers.
Exclusive content is another element of our content strategy. To support this approach, we are investing in content assets. We have invested in various content companies, including ITV plc, All3Media Ltd., LionsGate Entertainment, STX, Virgin Media TV (formerly TV3 Group) and De Vijver Media. We are also investing in sports, both as a broadcaster and as a rights owner. We have our own exclusive sports channels, Play Sports in Belgium, and MySports in Switzerland, which UPC Switzerland licenses to other non-competing cable operations in Switzerland. Also, the VodafoneZiggo JV owns Ziggo Sport. The basic Ziggo Sport service is available exclusively to the VodafoneZiggo JV’s customers; however, the premium service is widely available through license arrangements. 
In addition, we are commissioning our own exclusive drama series content. Through All3Media Ltd., which we own jointly with Discovery Communications Inc., we are co-producing television series for several of our markets. The first of these series, The Feed, is expected to be released in 2019. In addition, we have produced the Swiss sitcom Fassler-Kunz, the Swiss series Im Heimatland and the original Belgium series Chaussée d'Amour with local production companies. With LionsGate Entertainment, we are a partner in the production of a new spy thriller series The Rook. For each of these programs, the content will be available on demand to our customers. 
Customer Premises Equipment. We purchase each type of customer premises equipment from a number of different suppliers with at least two or more suppliers providing our high-volume products. Customer premises equipment includes set-top boxes, modems, WiFi routers, DVRs, tuners and similar devices. For each type of equipment, we retain specialists to provide customer support. For our broadband services, we use a variety of suppliers for our network equipment and the various services we offer. Similarly, we use a variety of suppliers for mobile handsets to offer our customers mobile services. 
Software Licenses. We license software products, including email and security software, and content, such as news feeds, from several suppliers for our internet services. The agreements for these products require us to pay a fee for software licenses and a share of advertising revenue for content licenses. For our TiVo service in the U.K., we have a partnership arrangement where TiVo is the provider of the user interface software for our next generation set-top boxes, which provides converged television and broadband internet capabilities. In 2017, we entered into a multi-year extension of our agreements with Tivo. For our mobile network operations and our fixed-line telephony services, we license software products, such as voicemail, text messaging and caller ID, from a variety of suppliers. For these licenses we seek to enter into long-term contracts, which generally require us to pay based on usage of the services.
I-19

For our mobile services provided through MVNO arrangements, we are dependent on third-party wireless network providers. Each of our MVNO operations has an agreement with such a provider to carry the mobile communications traffic of our customers. We seek to enter into medium to long-term arrangements for these services. Any termination of these arrangements could significantly impact our mobile services.
Competition
All of our businesses operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets. Technological advances and product innovations have increased and are likely to continue to increase, giving customers several options for the provision of their telecommunications services. Our customers want access to high quality telecommunication services that allow for seamless connectivity. Accordingly, our ability to offer converged services (video, internet, fixed telephony and mobile) is a key component of our strategy. In many of our markets, we compete with companies that provide fixed-mobile convergence bundles, as well as companies that are established in one or more communication products and services. Consequently, our businesses face significant competition. In all markets, we seek to differentiate our telecommunication services by focusing on customer service, competitive pricing and offering quality high-speed internet. In this section, we begin with an overview on the competitive nature of the video, broadband internet, and mobile and fixed-line telephony services in our markets, and then provide information on key competitors in our more material markets.
We believe that our deep-fiber access provides us with several competitive advantages. For instance, our cable networks allow us to concurrently deliver internet access, together with real-time television and VoD content, without impairing our high-speed internet service. In addition, our cable infrastructure allows us to provide triple-play bundled services of broadband internet, television and fixed-line telephony services without relying on a third-party service provider or network. Where mobile is available, our mobile networks, together with our fixed fiber-rich networks, allow us to provide a comprehensive set of converged mobile and fixed-line services. Our capacity is designed to support peak consumer demand. In serving the business market, many aspects of the network can be leveraged at very low incremental costs given that business demand peaks at a time when consumer demand is low, and peaks at lower levels than consumer demand. 
Overall, we are experiencing increased convergence as customers look to receive all their media and communication services from one provider. In our largest video markets, our key competitors for the provision of converged services are: BT (U.K.), Proximus NV/SA (Proximus) (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). Also, as described above under Products and Services—Investments—VodafoneZiggo JV, the key competitor for the VodafoneZiggo JV is KPN. Each of these competitors have extensive resources allowing them to offer competitively priced bundled services. As a result, our ability to offer triple-play or quad-play bundles and fixed-mobile convergence bundles is one of our key strategies to attract and retain customers. We seek to distinguish ourselves through our multimedia gateway services, interactive services (such as Replay TV and VoD), proprietary sports offerings, expanded content offers (for both in and out of the home) and our download speeds. 
Portions of our European systems have been overbuilt by FTTx networks and other cable operations. These systems are a significant competitive factor, primarily for our Poland and Slovakia operations. Based on research of various telecommunication publications, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and internal estimates, parts of our operations in Poland and Slovakia are overbuilt by FTTx networks. Other fiber and cable operators are estimated to have overbuilt approximately 80% of our footprint in Slovakia and 70% of our footprint in Poland. Although we have extensive FTTx overbuild in Switzerland, connectivity to the FTTx network is not available at all locations. In addition, government and quasi-government entities in certain of the countries in which we operate in Europe continue to invest in FTTx networks, creating another source of competition. 
In order to achieve download speeds of up to 100 Mbps or greater for customers, incumbent telecommunications operators are adopting VDSL with vectoring and bonding technologies as a more cost efficient solution compared to FTTx initiatives. For example, Swisscom has implemented vectoring in Switzerland. Vectoring is a transmission method that coordinates line signals to reduce crosstalk levels and improve performance. Bonding is a method of taking channels on either DSL or cable plant and bonding those channels together for a higher bandwidth throughput. 
Video Distribution
Our video services compete primarily with traditional free-to-air (FTA) broadcast television services, DTH satellite service providers and other fixed-line telecommunications carriers and broadband providers, including incumbent telephony operations offering (1) DTH satellite services, (2) IPTV over broadband internet connections using asymmetric DSL or VDSL or an enhancement to VDSL  called "vectoring", (3) IPTV over FTTx networks or (4) LTE Services. Many of these competitors have a national footprint and offer features, pricing and video services individually and in bundles comparable to what we offer. In certain markets, we also compete with other cable providers who have overbuilt portions of our systems. Mobile broadband has gained a noticeable share of video subscribers, which is another competitive factor.
I-20

OTT video content aggregators utilizing our or our competitors' high-speed internet connections are also a significant competitive factor, as are other video service providers that overlap our service areas. The OTT video aggregators (such as HBO Now, Amazon Prime and Netflix) offer VoD service for television series and movies, catch-up television and programming from broadcasters. Generally, the content libraries of such services are offered for a monthly fee. Typically these services are available on multiple devices in and out of the home. In some cases, OTT services are provided free-of-charge. To enhance our competitive position, we provide our subscribers with TV everywhere products and premium OTT video services through our online mobile apps, VoD and Replay TV services or our arrangement with Netflix. Our businesses also compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and entertainment, such as online entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/concerts and sporting events. 
Our ability to continue to attract and retain customers depends on our continued ability to acquire appealing content and services on acceptable terms and to have such content available on multiple devices and outside the home. Some competitors have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for certain programming, which limits the opportunities for other providers to offer such programs. Other competitors also have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for programs, but our operations have limited access to certain of such programming through select contracts with these companies, including Sky and BT in the U.K. and Ireland. If exclusive content offerings increase through other providers, programming options could be a deciding factor for subscribers on selecting a video service. 
Similar to our technological advances to enhance our video services, our competitors are also improving their video platforms with next generation set-top boxes, TV everywhere products and other interactive services. Similarly, VDSL, which is either provided directly by the owner of the network or by a third-party, is a significant part of the competitive environment in many of our markets, as are FTTx networks. In all of our markets, competitive video services are offered by the incumbent telecommunications operator, whose video strategies include IPTV over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks and, in some cases, DTH and DTT. The ability of incumbent operators to offer the triple-play of video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services and, in most countries, a quad-play with mobile services, is exerting competitive pressure on our operations, including the pricing and bundling of our video products. In order to gain video market share, the incumbent operators and alternative service providers in a number of our larger markets are pricing their DTT, IPTV or DTH video packages at a discount to the retail price of the comparable digital cable service.
In our Poland and Slovakia broadband markets, we face intense competition from DTH services. These DTH companies offer aggressively-priced packages of video content and in some cases offer triple-play packages. FTA broadcasters are also significant competitors in these markets. Our cable operations stay competitive by offering enhanced digital services, such as HD channel offerings, Horizon Go and expanded VoD services. These operations have also increased broadband internet speeds in their triple-play bundles to up to 500 Mbps. Promotional discounts are available, particularly on bundled options. 
We compete on value by offering advanced digital services, such as DVR functionality, HD, VoD, catch-up television, Replay TV, online mobile apps and multiscreen services and multimedia gateways. We also compete by offering advanced digital features and attractive content packages, as well as bundled services, at reasonable prices. In each of the countries in which we operate, we also tailor our packages to include attractive channel offerings and offer recurring discounts for bundled services and loyalty contracts. In addition, from time to time, we modify our digital channel offerings to improve the quality of our programming. Where mobile voice and data are available, we focus on our converged service offerings at attractive prices. In our other operations, we use the triple-play bundle as a means of driving video, as well as other products where convenience and price can be leveraged across the portfolio of services. We also continue to enhance our Horizon TV product to meet our customers’ desire to view programming anytime and anywhere, such as new applications and expanding its availability in our markets. 

• | Virgin Media. Virgin Media’s digital television services compete primarily with FTA television and with Sky, the primary pay satellite television provider. Sky offers competitively priced triple-play and quad-play services in the U.K. and Ireland. Other significant competitors are BT and TalkTalk Telecom Group plc (TalkTalk) in the U.K. and Eircom Limited in Ireland, each of which offer triple-play services, as well as IPTV video services. Each of these competitors have multimedia home gateways.

Sky owns the U.K. rights to various entertainment, sports and movie programming content and channels. Sky is both a principal competitor in the pay-television market and an important supplier of content to us. Various Sky channels, including Sky Sports, are available over Sky’s satellite system and our cable networks, as well as via Sky’s apps and online players and other television platforms, and some of the channels are available on BT and TalkTalk platforms. Virgin Media distributes several basic and premium video channels supplied by Sky. BT is also both a principal competitor and an important supplier of content to us. BT owns premium BT Sport channels, providing a range of sports content, including football (soccer) from the English Premier League and exclusive rights to the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. The BT Sport channels are available on our cable network as well as our competitors’ networks. 
I-21

In this competitive market, Virgin Media is expanding its broadband network and promotes its 4K enabled Virgin Media V6 set-top box in the U.K. In Ireland it offers Horizon TV and its functionalities (marketed as “Virgin TV”). The on-line streaming service Virgin TV Go is available throughout the Virgin Media footprint. Virgin Media customers also have access to third-party apps (e.g. Netflix, YouTube and Starz). In addition, Virgin Media’s ability to include mobile for its U.K. and Ireland customers for a low incremental fee creating a fixed-mobile convergence bundle is a key market offer. 

• | Telenet. Telenet’s principal competitor is Proximus, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which has interactive digital television, replay television, VoD and HD service as part of its video offer, as well as a remote access service. Proximus offers customers a wide range of both individual and bundled services at competitive prices. Also, Telenet and other Belgian cable operators must give alternative providers access to their cable networks. Orange Belgium N.V. (Orange Belgium) gained such access in 2016 and currently offers its mobile subscribers a dual play bundle, including enhanced video and broadband internet services. Telenet may face increased competition from other providers of video services who take advantage of the wholesale access and may be able to offer triple- and quad-play services. For more information on wholesale access, see Regulatory Matters—Belgium.

In order to compete effectively against alternative providers, Telenet leverages its extensive cable network, the broad acceptance of its basic cable television services and Yelo Play and its additional features, such as HD and DVR functionality, VoD offerings, its Play Sports channel and original programming (e.g. Chaussée d'Amour and De Dag). Telenet is able to offer international, national, regional and local content, including Dutch-language broadcasts, to its subscribers. It is also using mobile services to drive its other products through its converged offerings. In addition, Telenet continues to enhance its Yelo Play app and programming, including extending its rights to the English Premier League through 2019 and the addition of other sports rights. 

• | UPC Switzerland. Our main competitor in Switzerland is Swisscom, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which provides IPTV services over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks. Swisscom offers VoD services, DVR and replay functionality and HD channels, as well as the functionality to allow remote access to its video services, and has exclusive rights to distribute certain sports programming. Sunrise is also a significant competitor with its fixed-mobile converged bundles. In this saturated market, price competition is a significant factor. To compete effectively in Switzerland, UPC Switzerland is promoting Horizon 4 (marketed as “UPC TV”), as well as Horizon TV, and related family of products together with Replay TV and VoD, giving subscribers the ability to personalize their programming and viewing preferences. UPC Switzerland also has its own exclusive sports channel, My Sports, and aggregates third-party apps (e.g. Netflix and YouTube). It also uses its high-speed internet of up to 50, 200 or 500 Mbps to promote its extended digital tier bundles and offer mobile services.

Internet
With respect to broadband internet services and online content, our businesses face competition in a rapidly evolving marketplace from incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications companies, mobile operators and cable-based ISPs, many of which have substantial resources. The internet services offered by these competitors include both fixed-line broadband internet services using cable, DSL or FTTx networks and wireless broadband internet services. These competitors have a range of product offerings with varying speeds and pricing, as well as interactive services, data and other non-video services offered to homes and businesses. With the demand for mobile internet services increasing, competition from wireless services using various advanced technologies is a competitive factor. In several of our markets, competitors offer high-speed mobile data via LTE wireless networks. In addition, other wireless technologies, such as WiFi, are available in almost all of our markets. In this intense competitive environment, speed and pricing are key drivers for customers. 
Our strategy is speed leadership. Our focus is on increasing the maximum speed of our connections as well as offering varying tiers of service, prices and a variety of bundled product offerings and a range of value added services. We update our bundles and packages on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of our customers. Our top download internet speeds range from up to 350 Mbps in the U.K. to speeds of up to 500 Mbps available in Switzerland, Slovakia and Poland. In addition, we offer speeds of up to 1 Gbps in parts of Poland. We use our ultra high-speed internet services with access to Community WiFi and competitively priced bundles to encourage customers from other providers to switch to our services. The focus is on high-end internet products to safeguard our high-end customer base and allow us to become more aggressive at the low- and medium-end of the internet market. By fully utilizing the technical capabilities of DOCSIS 3.0 technology on our cable systems, we can compete with local FTTx initiatives and create a competitive advantage compared to DSL infrastructures and LTE initiatives on a national level. With the commercial deployment of our next generation gateways that will enable DOCSIS 3.1 on our cable networks, we plan to further improve our high-speed internet offers. 
Across Europe, our key competition in this product market is from the offering of broadband internet products using various DSL-based technologies by the incumbent phone companies and third parties. The introduction of cheaper and ever faster fixed-
I-22

line broadband offerings is further increasing the competitive pressure in this market. Wireless broadband services, such as LTE, are also significant competitors using high-speed mobile networks. We are expanding our ultra high-speed services and increasing our download speeds. In most of our markets, we offer our internet service on a standalone basis or through bundled offerings that include video, fixed-line telephony and mobile services. Mobile data is also increasingly important and we are addressing this through our wide range of mobile products, including expanding our LTE service area and offering SIM-only mobile products, as well as expanding our Community WiFi network.

• | Virgin Media. In the U.K., we have a number of significant competitors in the market for broadband internet services, including fixed-line incumbent telecommunications providers. Of these broadband internet providers, BT is the largest, which provides broadband internet access services to both its own retail customers and third-party retail providers over its own DSL network. BT has announced its intention to rollout ultrafast speeds of up to at least 300 Mbps by the end of 2020 to up to 5.7 million premises using G.fast technology, a DSL standard applied over copper local loops. BT has also set out its intention to rollout a FTTx service supporting 1 Gbps to three million homes and businesses by 2020 with a target to cover 10 million homes by 2025. As a result of these objectives, BT has launched a range of ultrafast packages offering speeds of up to 150 Mbps and 300 Mbps, respectively, using a combination of G.fast and FTTx technology, which are currently available to two million U.K. homes.

Operators such as Sky and TalkTalk deploy their own network access equipment in BT exchanges via a process known as local loop unbundling (LLU). This allows an operator to reduce the recurring operating costs charged by BT by reducing the proportion of traffic that must travel directly over BT’s network. LLU deployment requires a substantial capital investment to implement and requires a large customer base to deliver a return on investment. In addition to the competition and pricing pressure in the broadband market arising from LLU, competition from mobile broadband developments, such as LTE mobile services and WiFi services, is significant. Mobile providers continue to gain market share from fixed-line providers. These providers offer a range of mobile services.

• | Telenet. In the Flanders region of Belgium, Telenet is the leading provider of residential broadband internet services. Telenet’s primary competitor is the DSL service provider Proximus. Proximus is a well-established competitor offering quad-play bundles. Proximus’ DSL and VDSL services provide download speeds up to 100 Mbps. Mobile broadband penetration continues to increase, reaching nearly 80% of the total population by year-end 2017 based on the BIPT 2017 Annual Report. Similar to its video services, Telenet faces competition in the provision of internet services from other providers who have wholesale access to Telenet’s cable network. Through such access, Orange Belgium currently offers its mobile subscribers a dual-play bundle including enhanced video and broadband internet services. In this competitive market, Telenet is using its fixed-mobile converged offers to promote its internet and other services.


• | UPC Switzerland. In Switzerland, Swisscom is the largest provider of broadband internet services, and is UPC Switzerland’s primary competitor. Swisscom internet customers have access to its basic video content free of charge through its internet portal. It is also expanding its FTTx network and rolling out G.fast technology. Swisscom offers download speeds ranging from 40 Mbps to up to 1 Gbps. Swisscom’s internet speeds include 40 Mbps to 100 Mbps on its VDSL network and up to 1 Gbps in areas served by its FTTx network. Swisscom continues to expand its FTTx network to Switzerland households in our footprint, as well as in our partner network footprints. It has built its FTTx network in several cities in cooperation with municipality-owned utility companies and, where no cooperation agreement has been reached, Swisscom is building its own FTTx network. With respect to subscribers on the partner networks, UPC Switzerland competes with other service providers for the contracts to serve these subscribers. In this competitive market, UPC Switzerland increased it introductory speed to 50 Mbps and is promoting its broadband services through its bundled offers.

Mobile and Telephony Services 
Consumers are increasingly moving to mobile services. In Belgium, as a mobile network operator, we are one of the larger mobile providers based on number of SIM cards. We also have a growing mobile business in Switzerland and in the U.K. through MVNO arrangements. In our other European markets, however, we currently have minimal mobile presence. In the markets where we are a large mobile provider, we continue to seek additional bandwidth to deliver our wide range of services to our customers and increase our LTE services. Where we are a small mobile provider, we face significant competition from other mobile telephony providers, many of whom offer LTE services and are making significant advances in obtaining customers. In all of our markets competition is intense. We offer various calling plans, such as unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. In addition, we use our bundled offers with our video and ultra high-speed internet services to gain mobile subscribers. Our ability to offer fixed-mobile convergence services is a key driver. In several of our markets we provide converged services, including mobile, fixed-line, broadband and video. We are also exploring opportunities to offer mobile services in our other markets and mobility applications to our other services. 
I-23

The market for fixed-line telephony services is mature in almost all of our markets. Changes in market share are driven by the combination of price and quality of services provided and the inclusion of telephony services in bundled offerings. Our fixed-line telephony services compete against the incumbent telecommunications operator in the applicable market. In these markets, the operators have substantially more experience in providing fixed-line telephony and mobile services, greater resources to devote to the provision of fixed-line telephony services and long-standing customer relationships. In all of our markets, we also compete with other VoIP operators offering service across broadband lines. OTT telephony is also a competitive factor. In addition, our businesses face competition from other cable telephony providers, FTTx-based providers or other indirect access providers. 
Competition in both the residential and business fixed-line telephony markets is extremely competitive due to market trends, the offering of carrier pre-select services, number portability, the replacement of fixed-line with mobile telephony and the growth of VoIP services, as well as continued deregulation of telephony markets and general price competition. Carrier pre-select services allow the end user to choose the voice services of operators other than the incumbent while using the incumbent’s network. Our fixed-line telephony strategy is focused around value leadership, and we position our services as “anytime” or “any destination”. Our portfolio of calling plans include a variety of innovative calling options designed to meet the needs of our subscribers. In many of our markets, we provide product innovation, such as telephone apps that allow customers to make and receive calls from their fixed-line call packages on smart phones. In addition, we offer varying plans to meet customer needs and, similar to our mobile services, we use our telephony bundle options with our digital video and internet services to help promote our telephony services and flat rate offers are standard.
The incumbent telecommunication companies remain our key competitors but mobile operators and other VoIP operators, including ISPs, offering service across broadband lines are also significant competitors in these markets. Due to the maturity of the telephony market, competition is particularly intense in all of our markets with price often the deciding factor. To maintain or increase market share, we and our competitors focus on bundling telephony services with quality broadband offerings and other services. In each of our markets, we face competition with a dominant fixed-line telephony provider, most of which also have competitive mobile offers based on LTE services. In our largest markets, the key dominant telephony providers are BT (UK), Proximus (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). These telephony competitors are also the largest mobile operators in these markets based on number of SIM cards. These competitors include their mobile products in bundles with fixed-line services. Generally, we expect telephony markets to remain extremely competitive.
Discontinued Operations 
The primary competitor of Unitymedia is from FTA television received via satellite. Its primary competition for pay TV services is Deutsche Telekom, the incumbent telecommunications operator. Deutsche Telekom is also a significant competitor for broadband and wireless services. Deutsche Telekom offers competitively-priced bundles, including fixed-mobile convergence. In addition, Vodafone, also a competitor in Germany, bundles its IPTV service with its broadband offerings through Deutsche Telekom’s DSL network under a resell agreement making it a significant competitor in the double-play and triple-play market in Unitymedia’s footprint. It also has expanded its bundle offers to include mobile products. These converged offerings may enable Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone to reduce churn and attract new customers.
The other markets (Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic) face competition from DTH services. FTA broadcasters are also significant competitors. Significant portions of these markets have been overbuilt by FTTx networks and other cable operators, creating an additional competitive factor. In all the Vodafone Disposal Group markets, competition is intense.
Regulatory Matters 
Overview
Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated in each of the countries in which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the European Union (E.U.).
Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and type of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.

Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the U.K. are the Member States of the E.U. as of December 31, 2018. As such, these countries are required to harmonize certain laws with E.U. rules by transposing directives into their national law. In addition, other types of E.U. rules (or regulations) are directly enforceable in those countries without any implementation at the national level. Certain E.U. rules are also applicable across the European Economic Area, whose Member States are the E.U. Member States (excluding Croatia) as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway as of December 31, 2018. 
On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which U.K. citizens voted in favor of, on an advisory basis, an exit from the E.U. commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The terms of Brexit are subject to a negotiation period that could take until March 2019. The potential impacts, if any, of the uncertainty relating to Brexit or the resulting terms of Brexit on the free movement of goods, services, people, data and capital between the U.K. and the E.U., customer behavior, economic conditions, interest rates, currency exchange rates, availability of capital or other matters are unclear. In addition, the value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar remains at levels that are significantly below pre-Brexit levels. The effects of Brexit could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. One such area is the E.U. Communication Regulation described below. If a Brexit deal is agreed, the U.K. government has confirmed that it will transpose such regulation. If, however, no Brexit deal is approved, the U.K. Government has indicated that it will implement only the parts that support its policy objectives.    
In the broadcasting and communications sectors, there has been extensive E.U.-level legislative action. As a result, most of the markets in Europe in which our businesses operate have been significantly affected by the regulatory framework that has been developed by the E.U. Regulation in Switzerland, which is not a Member State of the E.U. and is not part of the European Economic Area, is discussed separately below, as well as regulations in certain Member States in which we face regulatory issues that may have a material impact on our business.
On May 6, 2015, the European Commission published its Digital Single Market strategy document. The strategy is an aggregation of many different policy areas with the purpose of creating a digital single market to expand jobs and stimulate growth. The strategy includes policy review in the areas of E.U. communications regulation, broadcasting law, copyright reform and anti-competitive geo-blocking practices.
E.U. Communications Regulation
The E.U. law that is the primary source of communications regulation in the European Union is the European Electronic Communications Code (the Code). The Code came into effect on December 20, 2018, as part of the Digital Single Market strategy and will need to be transposed into national law by December 21, 2020. Until then, its predecessor, the “Regulatory Framework”, will continue to apply. Although many of the rules under the Regulatory Framework have been included in the Code, there are significant changes required to be implemented by Member States.
The Code, similar to the Regulatory Framework, primarily seeks to develop open markets for communication services within Europe. It harmonizes the rules within the E.U. for the establishment and operation of electronic communication networks, including cable television and traditional telephony networks, and the offer of electronic communication services, such as telephony (including OTT services), internet and, to some degree, television services. The Code also includes a number of provisions aimed at providing incentives to boost private sector investment in very high capacity networks, and stimulating the harmonization of spectrum licensing to encourage investment in mobile networks and will result in more advanced services. The Code does not generally address content matters, including radio and television programming, which are specifically regulated by the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (as defined and described below).
Set forth below are certain key provisions included in the Code. This description is not intended to be a comprehensive or exhaustive description of all regulation in this area. 

• | Licensing and Exclusivity. The Code, similar to the Regulatory Framework, requires Member States to abolish exclusivities on communication networks and services in their territory and allow operators into their markets based on a simple registration. The Code sets forth an exhaustive list of conditions that may be imposed on communication networks and services. Possible obligations include, among other things, financial charges for universal service or for the costs of regulation, environmental requirements, data privacy and other consumer protection rules, “must carry” obligations, provision of customer information to law enforcement agencies and access obligations.


• | Significant Market Power. Certain of the obligations allowed by the Code, similar to the Regulatory Framework, apply only to operators or service providers with Significant Market Power (defined below) in a relevant market. For example, the provisions of the Code allow the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) in E.U. Member States to mandate certain access obligations only for those operators and service providers that are deemed to have Significant Market Power. For

I-25

purposes of the Code, an operator or service provider will be deemed to have “Significant Market Power” where, either individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a position of significant economic strength affording it the power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of competitors, customers and consumers. 
As part of the implementation of certain provisions of the Code, each Member State’s NRA is required to analyze certain markets predefined by the European Commission to determine if any operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. The European Commission has currently recommended that there be four such predefined markets, which are subject to periodic review. NRAs may, however, perform analysis of markets not listed in the recommendation, which requires the NRA to prove that additional requirements, the so called three-criteria test, are met.
NRAs might seek to define us as having Significant Market Power, single or jointly with another provider, in any of these predefined markets or they may define and analyze additional markets. In the event that we are found to have Significant Market Power in any particular market, an NRA could impose certain conditions on us. Under the Code, the European Commission has the power to veto a finding by an NRA of Significant Market Power (or the absence thereof), which power also applies with respect to market definition, in any market, regardless of whether it is a market predefined by the European Commission or an additional market defined by an NRA. We have been found to have Significant Market Power in certain markets in which we operate and further findings of Significant Market Power are possible. 

• | Video Services. The regulation of distribution, but not the content, of television services to the public is harmonized by the Code. Member States are allowed to impose on certain operators under their jurisdiction reasonable must carry obligations for the transmission of specified radio and television broadcast channels. Such obligations are required to be based on clearly defined general interest objectives, be proportionate and be transparent and subject to periodic review. We are subject to must carry regulations in all markets in which we operate. Must carry regulations are significantly different among Member States. In some cases, these obligations go beyond what we believe is allowable under the Code. To date, however, the European Commission has taken very limited steps to enforce E.U. law in this area, leaving must carry obligations intact in certain Member States. We do not expect the European Commission or the Member States to curtail such obligations in the foreseeable future.


• | Net Neutrality/Traffic Management/Roaming. In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted the regulation on the first E.U.-wide net neutrality regime. The regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States, permits the provision of specialized services, optimized for specific content and subjects operators to reasonable traffic management requirements. The regulation also abolished roaming tariffs beginning in June 2017.

Broadcasting Law
Although the distribution of video channels by a cable operator is within the scope of the Code, the activities of a broadcaster are harmonized by other elements of E.U. law, in particular the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS). The AVMS was revised and reissued December 18, 2018 under the Digital Single Market strategy. E.U. Member States must implement the revised AVMS into law by September 19, 2020. The revised AVMS maintained the country of origin principle and European works quota.
Generally, broadcasts originating in and intended for reception within an E.U. Member State must respect the laws of that Member State. Pursuant to the AVMS, however, E.U. Member States are required to allow broadcast signals of broadcasters established in another E.U. Member State to be freely transmitted within their territory, so long as the broadcaster complies with the law of their home state. This is referred to as the country of origin principle. Under the AVMS, the country of origin principle applies also to non-linear services, such as VoD. Accordingly, we could offer our own VoD services across the European Economic Area based on the regulation of the country of origin. As a result, we could have a single regulatory regime for all of our VoD services offered in Europe. In addition, when we offer third-party VoD services on our network, it is the business of the third-party provider of the services, and not us as the distributor, that is regulated in respect of these services. 
The AVMS also establishes quotas for the transmission of European-produced programming and programs made by European producers who are independent of broadcasters. The revised AVMS extended these quotas to linear and non-linear services. Under the AVMS, the providers of these services, including our operations, may be required to contribute financially to the European producers of the programming. 
According to the regulation of the European Commission addressing the portability of online audiovisual content services adopted in June 2017 and effective in April 2018, commercial providers of online content services (including OTT service providers) are required to enable subscribers who are temporarily present in any Member State with access and use of online content services in substantially the same manner as in the Member State of residence. We have modified our services to comply with these portability requirements. 
I-26

Copyright Law
In September 2016, the European Commission proposed a new regulation relating to satellite and cable retransmissions; again, as part of its Digital Single Market strategy. The proposal introduces a new country of origin principle in relation to online content, extends the existing copyright clearance system to other technologies (such as satellite, mobile and IPTV) and extends a similar rights clearance system to directly injected cable channels. Adoption of the proposal is expected in mid-2019. Once adopted, Member States will be required to transpose this retransmission proposal into national law within 24 months.
Other European Level Regulation
In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, our operating companies must comply with both specific and general legislation concerning, among other matters, data retention and electronic commerce. On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) with respect to data protection and retention became effective in the E.U.. The GDPR sets strict standards regarding the handling, use and retention of personal data. Organizations that fail to comply will face stiff penalties. As required, our operations have implemented various measures internally and with third-party vendors to meet these requirements. In addition, the European Commission published in January 2017, a proposal for a new e-Privacy regulation, replacing the current e-Privacy Directive that regulates privacy related issues in the electronic communications sector. Negotiations among E.U. Member States are still in process on this proposal. 
Our operating companies are also subject to both national and European level regulations on competition and on consumer protection, which are broadly harmonized at the E.U. level. For example, while our operating companies may offer their services in bundled packages in European markets, they are sometimes not permitted to make a subscription to one service, such as cable television, conditional upon a subscription to another service, such as telephony. They may also face restrictions on the degree to which they may discount certain products included in the bundled packages. 
The European Commission is imposing more mandatory requirements and encouraging voluntary solutions regarding energy consumption of the telecommunications equipment we provide our customers. We have been participating in discussions and studies regarding energy consumption with the European Commission and with experts working on their behalf. In addition, we are working with suppliers of our digital set-top boxes to lower power consumption, as well as looking at possibilities through software to lower the power consumption of the existing fleet of digital set-top boxes. We also worked with a large group of companies to create a voluntary agreement on set-top box power consumption as an alternative to regulation, which has been formally recognized by the European Commission. Nevertheless, legislation in this area may be adopted that could adversely affect the cost and/or the functionality of equipment we deploy to customers. 
Pursuant to an E.U. Regulation on standby power (the Standby Regulation), many devices are required to have either a low power standby mode or off mode, unless it is inappropriate to have either such mode on the device. Furthermore, the Networked Standby amendment to the Standby Regulation, effective as of January 1, 2015, regulates, among others, the maximum power consumption of networked consumer equipment while in the so-called “Networked Standby” mode. As a result, all of the devices we purchase and/or develop, including Horizon TV and Horizon 4 set-top boxes, Connect Boxes, cable modems and certain other equipment, operate under the power management requirements of the Standby Regulation. 
As part of the E.U.’s Radio Spectrum Policy Program, spectrum made available through the switch off of analog television was approved for mobile broadband use beginning January 1, 2013. This spectrum, known as the “digital dividend”, is in the 700 - 862 MHz band. The terms under which this spectrum becomes available varies among the European countries in which we operate. Certain uses of this spectrum may interfere with services carried on our cable networks. If this occurs, we may need to: (1) avoid using certain frequencies on our cable networks for certain or all of our services, (2) make some changes to our networks, or (3) change the equipment that we deploy. In approving mobile broadband, however, the Radio Spectrum Policy Program states that the new mobile services must co-exist with existing services, such as cable and DTT, to avoid harmful interference. As a result, we are in ongoing discussions with relevant Member States and the European Commission to be included in LTE mobile trials in order to develop mitigation techniques and to engage NRAs to launch regulatory dialog with equipment manufacturers and mobile operators to develop co-existing networks. 
Also, the Radio Equipment Directive, applicable since June 2016 and transposed into national legislation by E.U. Member States, establishes a regulatory framework for placing radio equipment on the market. Its objective is a single market for radio equipment by setting essential requirements for safety and health, electromagnetic compatibility, and the efficient use of the radio spectrum. It also provides the basis for further regulation governing some additional aspects. These include technical features for the protection of privacy, personal data and fraud. Furthermore, additional aspects cover interoperability, access to emergency services, and compliance regarding the combination of radio equipment and software. It also takes into account of the need for improved market surveillance; in particular, for the traceability obligations of manufacturers, importers and distributors. As a 
I-27

result, all of the devices we purchase and/or develop, including Horizon TV and Horizon 4 set-top boxes, Connect Boxes, cable modems, which contain radio interfaces (such as WiFi) and certain other equipment, must operate under these rules. 
There is a Mutual Recognition Agreement established between the E.U. and Switzerland for the purpose of mutual recognition of conformity assessment of regulated products. As a result, the Standby Regulation and the Radio Equipment Directive are also applicable in Switzerland.
With respect to cybersecurity, the E.U. adopted a directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive), which provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the E.U. Under the NIS Directive, E.U. Member States had until May 2018 to transpose it into their national laws and identify operators of essential services by November 2018. In principle, our operations within the E.U. do not fall under the NIS Directive as it exempts providers of Electronic Communications Services, which are governed by the E.U. telecommunications framework. Some national transpositions (for example, the Netherlands) and national definitions of essential services, however, could fall under specific NIS Directive obligations. As a result, our network and communication equipment would need to be compliant with these obligations. To date, none of our operating companies have been identified as falling under these obligations or being categorized as essential services. In the Netherlands, however, the VodafoneZiggo JV has been identified as an operator of essential telecommunication facilities due to its customer base of over one million subscribers. See —Netherlands below.
United Kingdom
In the U.K., the Regulatory Framework is implemented through (1) the Communications Act 2003, which regulates all forms of communications technology, whether used for telecommunications or broadcasting, and (2) the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006, which regulates radio communications in the U.K. (including spectrum, licensing arrangements, usage conditions and charges, license bidding and trading and enforcement and penalties). In addition, the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, as amended, implemented E.U. Directive 2002/58, which regulates the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector. 
Telecommunications companies in the U.K., including Virgin Media, are also subject to regulation under the U.K. Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 and other U.K. statutes and subordinate legislation, including the Competition Act 1998, the Enterprise Act 2002 and the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013. The U.K. Office of Communications (Ofcom) regulates both linear and on-demand programming, with regulatory requirements derived from the AVMS.
Ofcom is the key regulatory authority for the communications sector in which Virgin Media operates in the U.K. It is responsible for furthering the interests of citizens in relation to communications matters and furthering the interests of consumers in relevant markets where appropriate by promoting competition. From April 1, 2017, Ofcom also assumed the responsibilities of regulating the BBC, a role previously undertaken by the BBC Trust. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority has jurisdiction with respect to competition matters. 
Broadband Expansion. At the end of 2018, super-fast broadband was available to more than 95% of U.K. premises. The U.K. government plans to extend availability as far as possible beyond 95%. To stimulate private investment in this endeavor, the U.K. government is using money from the publicly funded BBC license fee, underspend from the Analogue TV Switch-Off Project and other sources of public investment. The state aid measure permitting this subsidy was renewed (and amended) in 2016 and is expected, through amendments to its “underspend” provisions, to result in up to an additional 1% to 2% super-fast coverage. 
The U.K. government also supports the market rollout of full fiber and 5G services. Such support includes public funding for the creation of a match-funded “full fiber deployment” fund, business rate relief for the deployment of new full fiber networks and public funding for a strategic program of full fiber and 5G trials. The U.K. government has set aside £740.0 million ($943.2 million) for that purpose, of which approximately £415.0 million ($528.9 million) is split among a local full fiber deployment fund, the first phase of the 5G trials and a gigabit voucher scheme. An additional £400.0 million ($509.8 million) has been made available as a contribution to a Digital Infrastructure Investment Fund, which is an arms-length lending facility of the U.K. government. 
The Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill received Royal Assent in February 2018, which gives effect to the U.K. government’s plans to provide full business rate relief for new fiber infrastructure built during the 2017-2022 rating period. Secondary legislation followed in April 2018, clarifying that the relief also applies to new lite fiber and any plant and machinery used to build the infrastructure. In addition, the U.K. government published its Telecoms Infrastructure Review in July 2018. This Review explored whether the conditions for investment in fiber are optimal in the U.K. and what policy changes should be considered to encourage greater investment in new digital infrastructure. The Government concluded that, with the right policy support, infrastructure based competition will deliver FTTP/Gbit capable networks to approximately 90% of U.K. premises. To facilitate this, the U.K. government intends to introduce a notification regime for multiple dwelling unit wayleaves, introduce a 
I-28

requirement for new housing developments to have FTTP access and increase consistency in street works and duct access. Consultations on multiple dwelling unit wayleaves and new development FTTP requirements were issued in December 2018. The U.K. government is expected to publish its conclusions for these actions in the spring of 2019.
In November 2015, the U.K. government announced that everyone will, by 2020, have a legal right to request a broadband connection of at least 10 Mbps regardless of where they live. The government intends to achieve this by introducing a broadband Universal Service Obligation (USO). The USO is aimed, in particular, at addressing the final 5% of the population in the U.K. without access to a broadband connection of a reasonable speed. The U.K. government introduced legislation in July 2017, to facilitate the introduction of a broadband USO. At the same time, BT made an alternative offer to invest approximately £600.0 million ($764.7 million) to provide ubiquitous minimum broadband speeds of 10 Mbps by 2022. The U.K. government formally rejected BT’s proposal in December 2017, favoring the imposition of a regulated USO. The U.K. government set out the design for the USO in secondary legislation in March 2018. Ofcom has responsibility for implementation (including designation of the Universal Service Providers (USPs) and deciding whether a USO constitutes an “unfair burden” on the USPs and, if so, designing an industry funding mechanism). It has until March 28, 2020 to make such determination. In December 2018, Ofcom issued a consultation on its proposed designation of BT and KCOM Group PLC as the USPs. Ofcom will consult on its approach to assessing any unfair burden claims as well as determining which operators would be required to contribute to a universal service industry fund in the Summer of 2019.
Television and VoD Services. In the U.K., Virgin Media is required to hold individual licenses under the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 for any television channels (including barker channels and any electronic programme guides), which Virgin Media owns or operates and for the provision of certain other services on its cable television platform, such as electronic program guides. These television licensable content service (TLCS) licenses are granted and administered by Ofcom. Under these licenses, each covered service must comply with a number of Ofcom codes, including the Broadcasting Code, and with all directions issued by Ofcom. Breach of any of the terms of a TLCS license may result in the imposition of fines on the license holder and, ultimately, the license being revoked.
As a provider of an on-demand program service (ODPS), Virgin Media must comply with a number of statutory obligations in relation to “editorial content” and notify Ofcom of its intention to provide an ODPS. Failure to notify Ofcom or comply with the relevant statutory obligations may result in the imposition of fines or, ultimately, the prohibition on providing an ODPS.
Regulation of Broadband Markets. In March 2018, Ofcom completed its latest review of the Wholesale Local Access market (incorporating physical or passive network access via methods such as LLU and duct access). Ofcom found that BT continues to hold Significant Market Power and had corresponding remedies imposed on it until April 2021. These remedies include price controls on “virtual” access to its wholesale 40/10Mbps FTTx product, the maintenance of access and pricing controls on its wholesale copper products and improvements to the existing physical infrastructure access product (third party access to BT’s duct and pole estate).
Future Approach to Regulation. In July 2018, Ofcom published a Strategic Policy Position, setting out its intended future approach to regulation from April 2021 (aimed at creating regulatory certainty to support investment in full fiber broadband). This resulted from its strategic review of digital communications in 2015 and 2016. It includes an intention to take a more holistic consideration of business and residential markets (ultimately combining previously separate markets) and to consider different regulatory approaches in different parts of the country, reflecting the varying levels of network competition. In December 2018, Ofcom published a consultation on its future approach for assessing geographic markets (to apply to the business and broadband market reviews from April 2021). It proposes to categorize areas of the country as follows: competitive areas, potentially competitive areas and non-competitive areas. In competitive areas, Ofcom will de-regulate; in potentially competitive areas, Ofcom will apply an investment friendly approach to regulation; and in non-competitive areas, Ofcom will regulate to protect consumers, while encouraging investment by Openreach, a division of BT. Ofcom has indicated that, at present, no areas of the U.K. are competitive, approximately 70% of U.K. premises are in potentially competitive areas and approximately 30% of U.K. premises are in non-competitive areas. Ofcom will consult on the suite of potential regulatory remedies that it will apply to the new holistic approach to market assessment in the spring of 2019.
Ofcom Review of Business Connectivity Markets. Ofcom concluded its latest review of the U.K. business connectivity markets (leased lines and dedicated business connections, among others) in the spring of 2016. Ofcom found BT held Significant Market Power in certain markets and proposed consequential regulatory remedies. These remedies included an obligation on BT to provide access to its dark fiber. This requirement was overturned on appeal. Ofcom commenced its latest review of these markets in November 2018. It has provisionally found that BT holds Significant Market Power in certain markets and geographies and has proposed remedies, including price caps and a narrower dark fibre obligation in areas where there is no infrastructure competition. Ofcom is also proposing to remove restrictions on BT with respect to duct and pole access so that such access can be used for business circuits exclusively without needing to be part of a wider (residential grade) broadband deployment.
I-29

Mobile Service. As an MVNO, Virgin Media is subject to E.U. regulations relating to retail prices for roaming services. These regulations: set limits on certain wholesale and retail tariffs for international mobile voice roaming, SMS tariffs and data roaming within the E.U.; provide for greater levels of transparency of retail pricing information; impose measures to guard against bill shock in respect of data roaming; and set maximum roaming rates within the E.U. Effective June 2017, the E.U. abolished roaming tariffs.
Mobile termination charges applied by mobile network operators are regulated by Ofcom under a Significant Market Power charge control condition. Under Virgin Media’s MVNO agreement, these changes in mobile termination charges are passed on to Virgin Media. Ofcom has set mobile termination charges for the period of 2018-2021, with rates reducing by approximately 5% from their starting levels by the end of this period. 
Fixed Voice Termination. Virgin Media has been designated as a provider with Significant Market Power on fixed voice termination. As a result, the rates it charges other providers for termination on its network are subject to regulation. This requires, among other things, the provision of termination on fair and reasonable terms, conditions and charges, which must be no higher than BT’s regulated charges, unless certain conditions are met. 
Belgium
Belgium has broadly transposed the Regulatory Framework into law. According to the electronic communications law of June 13, 2005, the Belgisch Instituut voor Post en Telecommunicate (the BIPT), the Belgian NRA, should perform a market analysis to determine which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In addition, the Federal Parliament prepared legislation to transpose the 2009 revisions to the Regulatory Framework, which became effective as of August 4, 2012. 
Telenet has been declared an operator with Significant Market Power in the market for call termination on an individual fixed public telephone network. Since April 1, 2012, reciprocal termination rates have been imposed, which results in Telenet charging the interconnection rate of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Proximus. Following a court annulment of a final decision on wholesale tariffs issued by BIPT in 2016, BIPT issued a new decision in November 2018 that proposes a wholesale tariff of €0.11 cents per minute as of January 1, 2019.
In May 2017, BIPT published its latest decision on the relevant market for “call termination on individual mobile networks”. Telenet, as an mobile network operator, has also been designated in the draft decision as having Significant Market Power by BIPT. In the draft decision, BIPT adopts a bottom-up long run incremental cost model to calculate tariffs for call termination on individual mobile networks, resulting in a nominal value of €0.99 ($1.13) per minute as of July 1, 2017.
In 2011, BIPT and the regional regulators for the media sectors (together, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities) found Telenet to have Significant Market Power in the broadcasting market (the 2011 Decision). The 2011 Decision imposed on Telenet an obligation to provide third-party operators, at specified “retail minus” tariff rates, with (1) a resale offer of an analog television package, (2) access to digital television platforms and (3) a resale offer of broadband internet access in combination with the digital television access obligation. 
On July 7, 2017, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities published a draft market review decision (the 2017 Draft Decision), which was filed with the European Commission on April 27, 2018. The European Commission issued comments in May 2018 and the 2017 Draft Decision was adopted on June 29, 2018 (the 2018 Decision). The 2018 Decision replaces the 2011 Decision. The 2018 Decision confirms that Telenet has Significant Market Power in the wholesale broadband market. The obligations include (1) providing third-party operators with access to the digital television platform (including basic digital video and analog video) and (2) making available to third-party operators a bitstream offer of broadband internet access (including fixed voice as an option). The 2018 Decision no longer applies a retail minus pricing on Telenet. Instead, it imposes monthly wholesale cable resale access prices during an interim period before setting “reasonable access tariffs”. These tariffs are expected to be implemented in mid-2019 with a link to cable cost model that is under development by the Belgium Regulatory Authorities of €20.29 ($23.24) (for services including broadband speeds of up to 149 Mbps) and of €30.12 ($34.49) (for services including broadband speeds of at least 150 Mbps). Telenet considers the 2018 Decision to be inconsistent with the principle of technology-neutral regulation and the European Single Market Strategy to stimulate further investments in broadband networks. As a result, Telenet has filed an appeal on the matter with the European Court of First Instance and the Brussels Markets Court, respectively. 
The 2018 Decision aims to, and in its application, may strengthen Telenet’s competitors by granting them resale access to Telenet’s network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding Telenet’s substantial historical financial outlays in developing the infrastructure. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (1) limit the bandwidth available to Telenet to provide new or expanded products and services to the customers served by its network and (2) adversely impact Telenet’s ability to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent 
I-30

on the extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access afforded to Telenet’s network, the rates that Telenet receives for such access and other competitive factors or market developments.
Switzerland
Switzerland has a regulatory system that partially reflects the principles of the E.U., but otherwise is distinct from the European regulatory system of telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act (Fernmeldegesetz) regulates, in general, the transmission of information, including the transmission of radio and television signals. Most aspects of the distribution of radio and television, however, are regulated under the Radio and Television Act (Bundesgesetz über Radio und Fernsehen). In addition, the Competition Act, the Data Protection Act and the Act on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications are potentially relevant to our business. With respect to energy consumption of electronic home devices, the Energy Act and the Energy Ordinance are applicable to set-top boxes. 
Under the Telecommunications Act, any provider of telecommunication services needs to register with the Federal Office of Communications. Dominant providers must grant access to their network to third parties, including LLU access; however, it is restricted to the copper wire network of the incumbent, Swisscom. Therefore, such unbundling obligations do not apply to our business in Switzerland and other cable operators. Also, any dominant provider has to grant access to its ducts, subject to sufficient capacity being available in the relevant duct. At this time, only Swisscom has been determined to be dominant in this regard. Dominant operators are obliged to provide interconnection and all providers of services forming part of the universal service in Switzerland have to ensure interoperability of services.
In regards to call termination as part of interconnection agreements, Swisscom as market dominant provider, must offer these services at cost-oriented prices and disclose the conditions and prices for their individual access services. In interconnection agreements with Swisscom, reciprocal termination rates are imposed. 
In September 2017, a draft of the revised Telecommunications Act was published by the Federal Council. The Federal Council plans to introduce measures to allow for easier access to the incumbent’s network, better consumer and youth protection measures (such as decreasing roaming fees, measures to prevent spoofing) and a change to the regulatory regime giving the Federal Communications Commission partial ex officio rights to impose obligations on market dominant providers. In terms of net neutrality, the draft foresees more transparency for the customer—he/she must be informed of traffic if treated unequally. During parliamentary debates on the proposal in 2018, new articles to the proposal were introduced. As a result, the proposal is subject to further parliamentary action to resolve differences and is not expected to be legally binding prior to 2020. 
Under the Radio and Television Act and the corresponding ordinance, cable network operators are obliged to distribute certain programs that contribute in a particular manner to media diversity. The Federal Government and the Federal Office of Communications can select up to 25 programs that have to be distributed without the cable operator being entitled to compensation. 
In September 2016, the Intelligence Agencies Act was approved by the Swiss population and became effective in September 2017. For Telecommunications service providers, the Intelligence Agencies Act set forth new obligations regulating cable traffic. 
The revised version of the Data Protection Act foresees more transparency regarding the processing of data. One example is by reinforcing the information duties when processing personal data. Furthermore, the new version follows the developments in the E.U. This revised version was subject to public consultation until April 2017. The Federal Council published the draft in September 2017. Subsequently, parliament decided that the revision would be implemented in two phases. For phase one, only mandatory alignments with E.U. rules will be implemented. For phase two, which includes more extensive provisions, further discussion by parliament will be undertaken in 2019. 
The Netherlands
The Netherlands’ electronic communications law broadly implements the Regulatory Framework. Pursuant to the electronic communications law, the Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM), the Netherlands NRA, performed a market analysis to determine which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In December 2011, ACM completed its analysis of the television market and concluded that there were no grounds for regulation of that market. As a result, no new regulations relating to the television market may be proposed without a new analysis. Similar to our other operations, the VodafoneZiggo JV is subject to must carry obligations, including a number of regional and local broadcasting channels, as well as public broadcasting channels. 
On August 5, 2013, ACM published a market analysis decision on call termination, which combines both the fixed termination market and the mobile termination market. Following various administrative actions, which resulted in the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court upholding the ACM decision in July 2017. The implementation of the new tariff under the ACM market analysis decision on call termination became effective on July 12, 2017, and will apply until July 12, 2020. The VodafoneZiggo 
I-31

JV appealed ACM’s market decision. In September 2018, the appeal court delivered a verdict against ACM’s market decision. The verdict provides guidance sought by the VodafoneZiggo JV on the interpretation and setting of interconnection tariffs among operators. 
In July 2015, the Dutch incumbent telecommunications operator KPN filed an appeal against the European Commission regarding its decision to approve the acquisition of Ziggo, which we completed in November 2014. In October 2017, the European General Court ruled that the European Commission did not state sufficient reasons for not analyzing the possible vertical anti-competitive effects on the market for premium pay TV sports channels; thereby annulling the European Commission’s clearance of the Ziggo acquisition. The E.U. Merger Regulation provides in such a case that the transaction be re-examined by the European Commission with a view of adopting a new decision. As a result, we filed a formal re-notification of the Ziggo acquisition with the European Commission. In May 2018, the European Commission again cleared the acquisition. KPN filed a pro forma appeal on this decision. We have not received any further information on this proceeding from the European General Court. 
KPN also filed a court challenge against the European Commission’s 2016 decision that approved the VodafoneZiggo JV transaction. KPN is seeking annulment of the 2016 decision. Oral hearings took place in November 2018. A decision on this action is not expected before the third quarter of 2019. 
On February 27, 2018, the ACM published a draft decision of its analysis of the LLU market, concluding that there is a single market for local and central access. ACM referred to this market as the Wholesale Fixed Access market and concluded that KPN and the VodafoneZiggo JV had joint Significant Market Power. As a result, ACM imposed on the VodafoneZiggo JV an obligation to offer wholesale cable access and continued wholesale cable access regulation of KPN. Following a market consultation, ACM submitted the draft decision to the European Commission. After comments by the European Commission, ACM published the final decision on September 28, 2018, which became effective on October 1, 2018. The VodafoneZiggo JV published a draft Reference Offer on December 31, 2018 and will publish a cost model in 2019. The VodafoneZiggo JV only has to invest in the implementation of cable access if there is actual demand (i.e. a signed contract with an access seeker). The VodafoneZiggo JV has appealed ACM’s decision before the national court and initiated an action before the European General Court. 
On November 9, 2018, the implementation of the NIS Directive by the Netherlands entered into force. In general, providers of electronic communication services are not in scope of the NIS Directive. The legislator for the Netherlands, however, decided to apply, to a certain extent, the NIS Directive on providers of electronic communication services. As a result, the VodafoneZiggo JV must notify the Netherlands Telecoms Agency and the National Cyber Security Center when a cybersecurity incident occurs, as well as the Netherlands Data Protection Authority if a data breach occurs. 
Discontinued Operations—Germany
Germany has incorporated the E.U. laws into national laws, although under the German legal system competency is split between the Federal State (telecommunication law) and the German federal states (Bundesländer) (media law). The German Telecommunications Act broadly implemented the Regulatory Framework and covers the distribution of any signal by telecommunications networks encompassing television signals, internet data and telephony. The German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) is responsible inter alia for the regulation of the German telecommunications market. The Federal Cartel Office (the FCO), the national competition authority (Bundeskartellamt), plays an important role with respect to infrastructure and media regulation. The FCO has powers to address competition issues in all markets, although in some cases, competition issues will be addressed by the German Federal Network Agency. 
Regulation of the media falls within the authority of the German federal states (Bundesländer). The media laws of all 16 federal states have been partially harmonized by the State Broadcasting Treaty (Rundfunkstaatsvertrag). The State Broadcasting Treaty establishes the main framework of the German regulation of broadcast. Nearly every German state has established its own independent regulatory body, the state media authority (Landesmedienanstalt) for the regulation of the private broadcasting sector. The state media authorities are primarily responsible for licensing and supervision of commercial broadcasters and the allocation of transmission capacities for radio and television channels. They also have authority with respect to the regulation of channel carriage fees, conditional access systems, interfaces, electronic programming guides, the bundling of programs and price regulation. 
The operation of conditional access systems for television services is governed by both the State Broadcasting Treaty and the German Telecommunications Act. Generally, operators must not unfairly obstruct or discriminate against broadcasters and other content providers through conditional access systems. 
Unitymedia has been declared an operator with Significant Market Power on the market for call termination on an individual fixed public telephone network. Since November 2013, reciprocal termination rates for exchanging calls via Unitymedia’s IP-interface have been imposed, which results in Unitymedia, like every other telecommunications provider in Germany, charging the interconnection rate of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom, when receiving traffic via the IP-
I-32

interface. The level of termination rates applicable to Unitymedia with respect to calls terminating on its IP-interface was set at €0.001 ($0.0011) per minute in 2018 and is currently set at €0.0008 ($0.0009) per minute.
