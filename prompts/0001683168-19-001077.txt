ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on April 14, 2014, as Illumination America, Inc. and changed our name to Grom Social Enterprises, Inc. on August 17, 2017.
 
Effective August 17, 2017, we consummated the acquisition of Grom Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Grom Holdings”) pursuant to the terms of a share exchange agreement (“Share Exchange”) entered into on May 15, 2017. In connection with the Share Exchange, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase its authorized capital from 100,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares of common stock and to change its name to “Grom Social Enterprises, Inc.” At the closing of the Share Exchange, the Company issued an aggregate of 110,853,883 shares of its common stock to the Grom Holdings shareholders, pro rata to their respective ownership percentage. Each share of Grom Holdings was exchanged for 4.17 shares of our common stock. As a result, the stockholders of Grom Holdings owned approximately 92% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock at such time.
 
All references to common stock totals or values in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) unless otherwise stated, have been adjusted, retroactively, to reflect the Share Exchange ratio of 4.17 as of August 17, 2017.

Grom Social
 
Grom Social is a social media company for kids focused on producing original content and generating revenue from our website and synergistic subsidiary companies. Although we have only generated minimal revenue to date, our core business is our Grom Social media website for children, which we refer to as “Grom Social.” The concept for Grom Social was developed in 2012, by Zach Marks, who was 12 years old at the time and is the son of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Darren Marks.

The name “Grom,” is derived from Australian surfing slang, and is defined by us to mean “a promising young individual who is quick to learn.” Visitors to our Grom Social website located at www.gromsocial.com may log on via mobile phone, desktop computer or tablet and chat with friends, view original content or play games created by us.
 
Grom Social’s business model which had generated nominal revenue to date is based upon providing children ages five through 16 with a safe environment on the Internet while promoting “fun,” “wholesomeness” and “family values.” We define a "user" as any child between the ages of five and 16 and any parent who sign up for a Grom Social account. We require that each child receive parental approval to gain full access to the Grom Social platform. In certain jurisdictions and circumstances, we allow parents, teachers and guardians (collectively, “parents”) to sign up groups of children at one time. If a child does not follow the sign-up process described above, he/she will have only limited access to the site. Limited access does not allow the child to chat with other children or visit certain sections of the site.
 
We define a "user" as any child between the ages of 5 and 16 who logs on or downloads Grom Social in the app stores. We require that each child receive parental approval to gain full access to the Grom Social platform. In certain jurisdictions and circumstance, we allow parents, teachers, and guardians (collectively, “parents”) to sign up groups of children at one time. As a result, instead of having an equal number of parents as users, we have a lesser number. If a parent’s approval is not given, the account will not be opened. The child will be considered a user but will have limited access to the Grom Social platform.
 
Since inception, based on data provided by Google Data Analytics and Joomla Management Systems (“Joomla’) we have generated in excess of 15 million users including parents and guardians, in over 200 countries and territories. Currently, there are approximately 876,000 monthly active users.
 
On April 4, 2019, we submitted our new mobile app to the Apple Store and the Google Play Store for approval. We have received approval from the Google Play Store into the “the Designed for Families program”. We expect approval shortly, from the Apple Store. Although there can be no assurances, we will continue to support our website until our new users can fully migrate to our mobile app which can also be used on tablets. This is a standard process for the development of any new app. Before an app can be offered to the public for a free download or for a charge, it is subject to a review process. The Apple store covers IOS or programs that can only be download on an Apple phone. The Google Play Store addresses apps that can only be downloaded on Android devices.
 
Previously we communicated with our database of users both actively, through email and a parent portal; and passively, through messaging on a child’s profile page and through seventeen unique Grom characters that offer the same engagement level with the children with many additional “fun” and safety features.
 
We believe our new mobile app is the only children’s app where kids can:
 

· | Openly (free-form) chat with each other, without restriction as opposed to having to choose from pre-selected words to make sentences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Record videos of themselves to post in a social environment and use enhanced facial features, masks, and filters while doing so;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | View exclusive Grom TV content - Video on demand (VOD) platform for kids which is free and curated to provide only safe and educational content for children. There is no user-generated Grom TV content so we don't run into problems that plague other social media sites;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Message and chat with cartoon characters – currently this feature is not offered anywhere else;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Communicate with users and parents (through Grom’s MamaBear app) regardless of where they may be navigating on our Grom Social website. This feature eliminates the need to leave the section of the site that they are engaged in.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

We have established the following safeguards and procedures to ensure our Grom Social website is a safe place for children:
 

· | Account Approval: We have account creation procedures to help ensure that only children between the ages of five and sixteen can create an account. If a child submits a request to open an account on the Grom Social website, we send an email notification to his or her parents that their child has applied to create a Grom Social account. If the child’s parents approve the account, by using one of three methods that are approved by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act(“COPPA”) guidelines, the account is opened. If a parent’s approval is not given, the account will not be opened, and the child will have limited access to the Grom Social website.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Parental Involvement: By requiring parental approval for a child to open an account and to interact with other users on Grom Social, we hope to ensure that parents are aware of and involved with their child’s activity on the website. Further, we believe that parental involvement provides us with the ability to market products and services to parents. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Digital Citizenship Educational Content – kids must take and pass an internet safety course and receive a Digital Citizen License (“DCL”) before having full access to the site.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Limited Data collection of Child and Parent – No digital profiles will be built for children or parents. Parent email, birthdate, gender and country locations is the most detailed profile we will build for a user, thus keeping them anonymous in our system. Information collected for analytical data only.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
MamaBear
 
MamaBear is a mobile, all-in-one parenting app that we acquired in September 2016. By using MamaBear, a parent can follow and protect their child’s online presence by monitoring their social networking/media accounts, including, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. The app is available on iTunes and Google Play. MamaBear provides parents with a powerful all-in-one safety and awareness tool that we believe offers a unique set of social media monitoring features, family mapping, alerts and reputation management tools, as well as alerts to cyber threats toward their children. Moreover, the app offers a private place for families to communicate and stay abreast of family activities.

· | Content Monitoring: We have software that monitors posts for inappropriate content using standard “keyword” filter technology. If a post contains inappropriate content, it will not appear on the website and the poster will be sent a warning about offensive content. We believe that through monitoring content we can promote social responsibility and digital citizenship.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Anti-bullying: We have software that monitors the Grom Social website for bullying. In addition to monitoring the interaction between children on the website, we also post messages that strongly emphasizes anti-bullying and actively promotes social responsibility and digital citizenship. Additionally, our website has received the “KidSafe Seal of Approval” from KidSafe, an independent safety certification service and seal-of-approval program designed exclusively for children-friendly websites and technologies, including online game sites, educational services, virtual worlds, social networks, mobile apps, tablet devices, connected toys, and other similar online and interactive services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Use of “Gromatars”: Children on Grom Social create animated pictures, which we call “Gromatars,” to represent themselves on Grom Social without providing a real-life photograph. Gromatars are viewed as profile pictures on a user’s home wall, and when a user leaves a comment or “like” on a public page. Kids can build and customize their Gromatars by selecting over 200 different options such as the eyes, nose, hair, teeth, ears, skin color, hairstyle, and color.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe these safeguards are a critical component of our business model. We believe that children are increasingly accessing the Internet at younger ages and therefore the need for safe, age-appropriate web venues for younger children to browse and interact with other children is increasing. According to current statistics shown on GuardChild.com (“GuardChild”) a website, focused on providing software and applications to promote safe Internet browsing for children and statistics collected from various resources including: Pew Internet and American Life Project, Global Insights in Family Live Online, Norton/Symantec, Pew Research, FOSI, and McAfee Online Safety Study focused on providing software and applications to promote safe Internet browsing for children:
 

· | Approximately 81% of 9-17-year-olds say they visited a social networking site in the past three months,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Approximately 41% of teens had a negative experience as a result of using social networking; and 


· | Approximately 88% of teens have seen someone be “mean or cruel” to another person on a social networking site.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Content
 
In addition to providing a safe, social media platform for children to interact with their peers, we create our own content consisting of animated characters, interactive chats, videos, blogs, and games. geared to provide wholesome family entertainment.

According to Statista.com and Google Analytics, as of 2017, the average online duration of an Internet user between the ages of 6-11 has at a minimum doubled since 2014 from approximately 11-22 minutes in 2014 to 39 to 43 minutes in 2017. Based upon our login statistics provided by the Joomla management system, the average online duration of users logged onto our Grom Social website is approximately 47 minutes. We believe the longer duration time is a result of our ability to better engage users through our original content.

Strategy
 

· | Advertising Revenue. We believe that the release of our new app will enable us immediately begin to generate advertising revenue and the growth of our database may attract high-profile companies to advertise on our Grom Social website and mobile platforms, although there can be no assurances of advertisers using Grom’s website or mobile app. We intend to emphasize to advertisers what we believe is the unique level of parental involvement on Grom Social. We currently have one advertising program in early non-revenue testing. We currently expect to enter into an advertising partnership that will allow advertisers to sponsor certain sections of the app. We intend to charge each advertiser a fee for each view/click and/or commission to advertise a particular brand/product or service on our platforms.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Subscription Based Premium Content. Although we currently do not charge a subscription fee, we feel that we will be able to move to a subscription model by the end of 2019 based on our analytics and reaction to our exclusive live-action content. We are continuously making software upgrades which will enable us to offer premium “VIP” content to users for which they will be charged a monthly subscription fee. Users that sign up for this VIP program will become Grom Club Members. We currently hope to offer Grom Club Memberships during the fourth quarter of 2019 which will enable Grom Club Members to utilize current and new features to:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Create and view interactive videos that can be shared with other Grom Club Members, with non-paying Grom users and with any other third parties in their approved network;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Receive exclusive Gromatar options and accessories such as: masks, voice modification, face modification, special effects, and numerous filters.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Have unlimited access to new premium games;
--+--------------------------------------------


Ø | Receive free monthly screen savers and animated gifts; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Engage in exclusive chats with athletes and celebrities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Collaborate, through a feature called ColabLab (only available on the desktop version) with Zach and other Grom Club Members with similar interests to create new Grom Social features; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Earn and collect “Grom Coin Packages” (only available on the desktop version) that can be used to purchase merchandise, play games or purchase other exclusive content on the Grom Social website. Grom Club Members will earn Grom Coin Packages by participating in activities on the Grom Social website; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Receive discounts on Grom merchandise to be developed;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Turn off ads;
--+--------------


Ø | Enhanced feature sets-extended video recording time
--+----------------------------------------------------

 
Throughout our monetization efforts, we will maintain a free version of the app so we do not believe it will have any negative impact on our user base
 

· | Longer Term Revenue Opportunities. In addition to the foregoing near term initiatives, although there can be no assurances we will be successful, we currently expect to add the following features in the first half of 2020 to the Grom Social app:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Online Game Fees. The games currently available to users on our website are free. We intend to offer users an option to pay to play exclusive games and/or pay for game upgrades. These games may be developed by us, such as Grom Skate or obtained from outside developers, and adapted to use on our website.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Licensing Merchandise Revenue. We hope to create Grom apparel and other merchandise for purchase through our website and mobile app and enter into licensing and merchandise agreements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grom’s multimedia mobile app enables children to interact with each other in a “safe” and “fun” environment. Features of the app include direct messaging, video recordings with face filters and effects, notifications, profiles with custom colors, Gromatar cartoon avatars, over 1,000 hours of Grom TV exclusive videos on demand, a search and discovery section, hashtags and mentions in post descriptions, liking, commenting, and sharing of content, and the ability to share photos, videos and doodle drawings in direct messages. With this feature set and the safety permissions in place, the app gives children their own social platform similar to the popular adult platforms, but in a safe controlled environment.
 
TD Holdings
 
TD Holdings conducts its operations through its subsidiary companies, TDHK and TDA. The group’s principal activities, based in Manila, Philippines, are the production of 30-minute animated films.
 
TDA is a full-service production and pre-production studio working with international clients. TDA specializes in producing 2D digital animation production services for series and movies, primarily for international television markets. TDA provides its services on a contract for services basis or under co-production arrangements.
 
For pre-production, TDA produces storyboards, location design, model and props design, background color and color styling. For production, TDA focuses on library creation, digital asset management, background layout scene assembly, posing, animation and after effects. TDA currently provides services to high-profile properties, including Tom and Jerry, My Little Pony and Disney Animation’s Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero. TDA produces over two hundred half-hour segments of animated content for television annually, which we believe makes it one of the top producers of animation for television worldwide.
 

TDA’s notable projects include: | | |

Grom Educational Services
 
On January 2, 2017, we acquired web filtering assets including a proprietary Internet filtering software, NetSpective Webfilter ( the “NetSpective Web Filter”) from TeleMate.net. We have sold subscriptions for webfiltering software to approximately 3,700 schools and 2 million children where clients pay upfront for a period of one to five years. NetSpective products comply with The Children's Internet Protection Act (“CIPA”), which requires that K-12 schools and libraries in the United States use Internet filters and implement other technology protection measures to protect children from harmful online content as a condition for federal funding.
Grom Nutritional Services
 
GNS was formed in April 2017 with the intention of marketing and distributing four flavors of nutritional supplements to children.
 
In December 2016, Grom entered into an agreement with Bond Technology Systems, Inc. (“BondTech”) a manufacturer of proprietary liquid supplements to develop a drink formulation for Grom. Under the terms of the agreement, we formed GNS as a wholly-owned subsidiary to initially market and distribute four flavors (mixed berry, fruit punch, apple, and orange/vanilla) of a nutritional based supplement using the "Just Brilliant" brand name (TM application pending) to our user base of children and their parents. We intend to gear subsequent marketing efforts to the wholesale/retail grocery, convenience, and big box sectors.


The agreement also provides that BondTech will provide $200,000 in funding toward the formulation of the product, logistics, and manufacturing. The formulation will be owned by GNS with profits from the sale of the product split 50/50 between BondTech and GNS.
 
The development of the formulation has taken considerably longer than anticipated because the initial co-packer identified by BondTech was unable to provide an acceptable formulation that met our quality standards. We are in the process of developing a new formulation with a new co-packer. Although there can be no assurances, we currently believe that we will have a marketable product by the end of the second quarter of 2019, although there can be no assurance that there will not be further delays.
 
Illumination America Lighting
 
IAL is currently an inactive wholly-owned subsidiary. IAL acquired the LED lighting business formerly operated by Illumination America, Inc. prior to the Share Exchange. We expect IAL to remain inactive for the immediate future and do not plan to commit any Company resources to the IAL business.
Acquisition Strategy
 
Our acquisition strategy is to acquire synergistic companies, products or intellectual property that will help grow our Grom Social user base and also will become profitable as a stand-alone enterprise or division.
 
Acquisition of TD Holdings
 
On July 1, 2016, we entered into an acquisition agreement (the “TDH Acquisition Agreement”) for the acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of TD Holdings for which we paid $4,000,000 in cash and issued a 5% secured promissory note, in the principal amount of $4,000,000, which originally matured on July 1, 2018 (the “Note”) and 7,367,001 shares of our common stock valued at $4,240,000, or approximately $0.58 per share, to the selling shareholders of TDA (“TDA Sellers”). Wayne Dearing, the founder, 50% owner and managing director of TD Holdings is currently one of our executive officers.
 
Under the terms of the TDH Acquisition Agreement, we are also required to make additional payments to the TDA Sellers, up to a maximum of $5,000,000 (“Earnout Payments”) if TD Holdings achieves certain adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA Targets”) during the three-year period following the acquisition (the “Earnout Period”). The Earnout Payments, if any, will be paid 25% in cash and the balance in shares of common stock. The number of shares issuable shall be determined by using a share price equal to the lower of a 10% discount to our last private placement price per share prior to making the Earnout Payment, to a bona fide investor, and priced at arm’s length; or if the shares are listed on a recognized stock exchange and publicly traded, at a 10% discount to the previous 20 day weighted average closing price per share.

The applicable EBITDA Targets and Earnout Payments for each of the initial three years during the Earnout Period from 2016-2018 (and as extended to the year ended 2019 described below) are as follows:
 

EBITDA Target | Earnout Payment
--------------+----------------
$2,400,000 | $1,666,667 
$3,700,000 | $3,333,333 

 
In the event that TD Holdings achieves an EBITDA in an Earnout Year greater than $2,400,000 but less than $3,700,000, the Earnout Payment is calculated by multiplying $3,333,333 by the sum of “A” divided by “B” where:
 
“A” equals the sum of $3,700,000 less the EBITDA earned; and
 “B” equals $1,300,000 (being the difference between $2,400,000 and $3,700,000).
 
The foregoing notwithstanding, in the event that TD Holding’s EBITDA in any 12-month period during the Earnout Years is equal to or greater than $3,700,000, the full amount of the Earnout Payment will be paid one month after that EBITDA Target is achieved and no further Earnout Payments shall be made.
 
No earnout has been achieved for the three-period period between 2016-2018. The original Earnout Period was extended to December 31, 2019, pursuant to the First Amendment described below.
 
First Amendment of TDH Acquisition Agreement
 
On January 3, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the TDH Acquisition Agreement with the TDA Sellers (the “First Amendment”). Under the terms of the First Amendment:

· | the maturity date of the Note was extended from July 1, 2018 until July 1, 2019 (the “First Note Extension Period”); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the interest rate on the Note was increased from 5% to 10% during the Note Extension Period; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | during the Note Extension Period, the interest will be paid quarterly in arrears, instead of annually in arrears. The first such quarterly interest payment of $100,000 was due on September 30, 2018; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Earnout Period was extended to December 31, 2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 
Also, as consideration for the First Amendment, we issued an additional 800,000 shares of our common stock to the TDA Sellers.
 
Second Amendment of the TDH Acquisition Agreement 
 
On January 15, 2019, we entered into a second amendment to the TDH Acquisition Agreement (the “Second Amendment”). Under the terms of the Second Amendment:
 

· | the maturity date of the Note was extended from July 1, 2019 to April 2, 2020.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the TDA Sellers shall have the right to convert the Note at a conversion price of $0.27 per share, either in whole or in part at any time prior to the maturity, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Amendment
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in the event the Note is not repaid prior to July 2, 2019: (i) no management fee shall be paid by TDA to the Company as provided in the Share Sale Agreement. Management fees paid by TDA to the Company to date are approximately $100,000 per month. Non-payment of the management fees to the Company by TDA due to the non-payment of the Note would have a material adverse impact on the Company.

Acquisition of the MamaBear Mobile Software Application Assets of GeoWaggle, LLC (“MamaBear”) 
 
On September 30, 2016, we purchased the online application and website “MamaBear”. As consideration therefor, we issued 208,500 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $162,500, or approximately $0.78 per share. MamaBear is intended to generate revenue through a paid subscription and advertising model. In 2018, the revenue generated by the MamaBear safety application has been nominal.
 
Acquisition of the NetSpective Webfilter Assets and Software from TeleMate.net 
 
On January 1, 2017, we acquired the assets of NetSpective, a division of TeleMate.net Software, a Georgia corporation, (“Telemate”) pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement (the “APA” ). Under the terms of the APA, we issued a three-year 0.68% $1,000,000 redeemable, convertible promissory note (the “Telemate Note”) convertible into our common stock at a conversion rate of $0.78 per share. If not converted by Telemate by November 1, 2019, the Telemate Note may be converted by the Company into shares of the common stock at a conversion rate of $0.48 per share. In addition, we entered into a master services agreement (“MSA”) with TeleMate whereby Telemate provided engineering and sales support for a period of twelve months. Under the terms of the MSA, TeleMate assumed all of the risks of NetSpective losing cash measured on a GAAP basis, for a one-year period in operating Netspective in its customary fashion.
 
Additionally, TeleMate was entitled to an earn-out payment of up to $362,500, payable in our common stock at a price of $0.78 per share or 464,744 shares, if the NetSpective WebFilter generated $362,500 in “net cash flow” as defined by the APA Agreement for the one-year post-acquisition period ended December 31, 2017. Such cash flow was achieved by NetSpective, so they became entitled to receive the Earnout. However, TeleMate did not meet the terms of the MSA and failed to remit $146,882 collected on our behalf from NetSpective customers pursuant to the MSA. As a result, we entered into a First Modification to the APA (the “First Modification”).
 
Under the terms of the First Modification, TeleMate agreed to pay us $10,000 per month against their outstanding balance due to us of $146,822. The TeleMate Note may not be converted or any earnout shares issued by us until the outstanding balance is paid in full, and all interest payments due under the TeleMate Note have been suspended until all payments owing the Company has been made. If and when TeleMate is permitted to convert the TeleMate Note, the number of shares converted thereunder will be subject to a one-year leakout agreement.
 
We have received payment in full on the $146,822. If TeleMate does not convert the TeleMate Note to equity by October 1, 2019, the Company has the right to force conversion at a conversion price of $0.48 per share.
 
Acquisition of the Assets of Fyoosion LLC 
 
On December 27, 2017, we acquired of all of the assets of Fyoosion LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Fyoosion”), which included primarily goodwill, its website, and source code, as well as all other documentation. Fyoosion’s proprietary software utilizes a digital automation marketing platform for businesses to enable companies to efficiently generate sales leads and improve customer retention.
 
In consideration, therefore, we issued an aggregate of 300,000 shares of our common stock to Fyoosion. Such shares are subject to a leakout agreement limiting the number of shares that can be sold during the one-year period following the date of the asset purchase agreement to 25% of the daily average trading volume during the period prior to such sale. The agreement also provides that if the Company’s proposed business utilizing the assets attains EBITDA of $125,000 in the first year of the agreement, Fyoosion will be entitled to an additional 200,000 shares. This threshold was not met in 2018 and is not expected to be met in the future.

Business Strategy 
 
We hope to grow our business through a combination of marketing initiatives and synergistic acquisitions in an effort to increase our Grom Social user base to a large enough size to enable us to attract advertisers and paid users for our VIP content. However, there can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful or that our revenues will increase as a result of our business strategies.
Our Growth Strategy
 
Our growth strategy is as follows:
 
·         Increase the size of our database of users at Grom Social. Comparable to other successful social media companies, we believe the key strategy to our future success is to grow the size of our database. Although the revenue from Grom Social is now nominal, the database continues to grow we believe due to our production of original content and through synergies from our subsidiary companies. For example, at GES our MamaBear application has in excess of 900,000 downloads since inception. We are in the process of making these users aware of the Grom social website. There can be no assurance that we can continue to grow the Grom website and that if we are successful in doing so, we will be able to generate revenues from the website and from the new mobile application which is expected to launch in May 2019 assuming approval by Apple Store. The Google Play app has already been accepted.
 
·        Expand Core Products. We manage our existing and new brands through strategic product development initiatives, including introducing new products and modifying our existing intellectual property. Our marketing team and development teams strive to develop enhanced products to offer added technological, aesthetic and functional improvements to our portfolio of products.
 
·        Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We supplement our internal growth with selected strategic and synergistic acquisitions.   
 
Seasonality
 
We believe that seasonality does not have any impact on our operations. 
 
Competition
 
Grom Social
 
The markets in which we compete are characterized by innovation and new and rapidly evolving technologies. We believe we will face significant and intense competition in every aspect of our intended business, including from Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Google, which offer a variety of Internet products, services, and content, that will compete for our user's Internet time and spending dollars. In addition to facing general competition from these large, well-funded companies, we also face competition from smaller Internet companies that offer products and services that may compete directly with Grom Social for users, such as Yoursphere, Fanlala, Franktown Rocks, and Sweety High. Additionally, as we introduce new services and products, as our existing services and products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition from:

· | Companies that offer products that replicate either partial or the full range of capabilities we intend to provide.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Companies that develop applications, particularly mobile applications, that provide social or other communications functionality, such as messaging, photo-and video-sharing, and micro-blogging.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Companies that provide web-and mobile-based information and entertainment products and services that are designed to engage our target audience and capture time spent on mobile devices and online.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of these companies have substantially greater resources than us.
 
We believe that the following features differentiate us from our competitors and provide us with a possible competitive advantage with respect to our target market:
 

· | We provide children with a social media experience in a safe and controlled environment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We encourage direct parental involvement and oversight;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | We produce content developed by “kids and for kids”;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | We have developed a comprehensive registration process to safely register children on the website;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We provide 24/7 live monitoring of the website by trained individuals to help protect children from malicious content found that may be found on other social networking sites available to children, supplemented by standard “bad word” filtering software; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that Grom Social is one of the only, if not the only, Internet platform that offers games, chatrooms, educational services, social interaction, exclusive content, global connectivity, and group collaboration to develop new content and activities based on user behavior in one platform.
 
TD Holdings
 
We have extensive competition in our animation business coming from Korea, Canada, India, Ireland and to a lesser degree, China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. Businesses in these countries may receive government subsidies which may make it difficult to compete due to artificially low pricing levels. 
 
We expect that TDA’s digitally animated features will compete with family-oriented, animated and live-action feature films and other family-oriented entertainment products produced by major movie studios, including Disney, DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc., Warner Bros. Entertainment, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Fox Entertainment Group Inc., Paramount Pictures, Lucasfilm Ltd., Universal Studios, Inc., MGM/UA, and Studio Ghibli as well as numerous other independent motion picture production companies.
 
The primary competitors of TD Holdings in the Philippines are Toon City Animation, Snipple Animation Studio, and Synergy 88 Digital. Another significant competitor is Mercury Filmworks in Canada.
 
The competitive environment in the television industry has changed significantly over the past few years following the deployment of digital set-top boxes, the launch of numerous new television networks and the resulting fragmentation of the market. Competition is based primarily on consumer preferences and extends to the Company’s ability to generate and otherwise acquire popular entertainment and trademark properties and secure licenses to exploit, and effectively distribute and market, such properties.
 
Grom Educational Services
 
iBoss, Lightspeed, and Securly are GES’s main webfiltering competitors. There are other larger companies that have web filtering as a part of the larger product offering including Forcepoint (Websense), Bluecoat, Palo Alto Networks, Barracuda and Cisco. All of the larger companies are enterprise focused where they sell numerous products, and filtering is a minimal part of their portfolio.

Grom Nutritional Services
 
Consumer awareness regarding the benefits of dietary supplements and new product availability are the major drivers for the market worldwide. The nutritional supplements markets is an extremely competitive market estimated to be a $175 billion global market by 2020 according to the FN Media Group LLC. The largest companies in this space are Axxess Pharma Inc., Celsius Holdings, Inc., GNC Holdings Inc., and Pfizer Inc. 
Illumination America Lighting 
 
Since we are a distributor and not a manufacturer of lighting products, we currently face very intense competition from both traditional lighting companies that provide general lighting products, including incandescent, fluorescent, high-intensity discharge, metal halide, and neon lighting. We also have competitors from specialized lighting companies that are engaged in providing LED products. In general, we compete with both groups on the basis of our design, quality of light provided, maintenance costs, safety issues, energy consumption, price, product quality and brightness. Additionally, there are thousands of electrical contractors and lighting distributors of varying scales that install and distribute LED lighting products.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to several U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy and data protection, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, personal information, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of data. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. including data protection regulation.
 
In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
 
Our website follows the guidelines of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. 6501–6505. COPPA imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age.
 
Additionally, we are subject to CIPA, which was enacted by Congress in 2000 to address concerns about children's access to obscene or harmful content over the Internet. CIPA imposes certain requirements on schools or libraries that receive discounts for Internet access or internal connections through the E-rate program – a program that makes certain communications services and products more affordable for eligible schools and libraries. In early 2001, the FCC issued rules implementing CIPA and provided updates to those rules in 2011.
 
The Just Brilliant nutritional supplement we intend to market to children, is governed by the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The FDA defines supplements as a product intended to increase its levels in the diet. These may include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, or other plant-based substances. Over-the-counter supplements do not undergo the same formal approval process as prescription and over-the-counter drugs. The FDA does not require supplement manufacturers to submit their products to the FDA for review nor receive FDA approval, however, before marketing, companies must ensure they are not making false claims on the product label to mislead consumers. Like other food substances, dietary supplements are not subject to the safety and efficacy testing requirements imposed on drugs, and unlike drugs they do not require prior approval by the FDA; however, they are subject to the FDA regulations regarding adulteration and misbranding.
