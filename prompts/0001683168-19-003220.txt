Item 1. Business
Corporate Overview
 
We are currently a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company.
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 13, 2012. Our current business office is located at No. 45-2, Jalan USJ 21/10, Subang Jaya 47640, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia. Our telephone number is +6012 697 1115.
 
We were initially an exploration stage company under the name of Freedom Petroleum Inc. (changed to Steampunk Wizards, Inc., effective on July 2, 2015) that originally intended to engage in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties. In April 2015, after reviewing the markets with investor appetite and management's duties to its shareholders, the Company determined to discontinue its oil and gas operation. We then began exploring opportunities in the computer gaming and application industry.
 
We engaged in computer game development until October 13, 2016, when control of our company changed pursuant to a share purchase agreement and a spin-off agreement. On October 26, 2016, our corporate name was changed from “Steampunk Wizards, Inc.” to "Tianci International, Inc." The name change was effected on November 27, 2016, in connection with the merger of us into our then subsidiary, Tianci International Inc.
 
Effective April 6, 2017, we effectuated a 1-for-40 reverse stock split (the “2017 Reverse Stock Split”) of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value, whereby 49,854,280 outstanding shares were exchanged for 1,246,357 shares of our common stock. Common share amounts and per share amounts in these accompanying financial statements and notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split.
 
On August 3, 2017, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Shifang Wan (the “Seller”), the record holder of 4,397,837 common shares, or approximately 87.00% of the issued and outstanding of Common Stock of the Company, and Chuah Su Chen and Chuah Su Mei (collectively, the “Purchasers”, and together with the Company and the Seller, the “Parties”). Pursuant to the SPA, the Seller sold to the Purchasers and the Purchasers acquired from the Sellers the Shares for a total gross purchase price of Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000). The acquisition was consummated on August 15, 2017. The Purchasers used personal funds to acquire the Shares.
 
Upon the consummation of the sale, Ms. Cuilian Cai resigned from her positions as director, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Her resignation was not due to any dispute or disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices. The following individuals were also appointed to serve in the positions set forth next to their names below:
 

Name | Position 
--------------+------------------------------------------------
Chuah Su Chen | Director, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary
Chuah Su Mei | Director, Chief Executive Officer and President
Yeow Yuen Kai | Director and Chief Technology Officer 

 
Jerry Ooi was appointed to serve as a director effective August 30, 2017. Mr. Kai resigned from his position as the Chief Technology Officer effective September 20, 2017, and his position on our Board effective August 31, 2019.
 
Current Business 
 
Our principal business is to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Based on proposed business activities, we are a “blank check” company. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.

As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not entered into any binding agreement with any party regarding acquisition opportunities for us. While we are parties to a nonbinding term sheet to acquire an affiliated company, we continue to engage in active discussions with other operating businesses affiliated with our executive officers regarding potential acquisition opportunities. There is no assurance that any nonbinding term sheet will result into a definitive purchase transaction nor can we assure you that we will be able to successfully acquire such company or any company in the near future.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s officers. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

• | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
• | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
• | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds from the Registrant, from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
• | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 
• | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and 
• | Other relevant factors. 

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available acquisition opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business to be acquired. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information that may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources.
 
We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business’s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our lack of funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or others associated with the target business seeking our participation.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.
 
Additionally, we are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities, which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We are, and will continue to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination.

Historical Activities
 
2014 Securities Sale
 
In January 2014, we were a party to a securities purchase agreement (the "2014 SPA") by and among ourselves, certain of our shareholders (the "Selling Shareholders") owning an aggregate of 27,000,000 shares (before the 2017 Reverse Stock Split) (approximately 51.7%) of our common stock (the "Sold Stock") and Anton Lin ("Lin"). Pursuant to the 2014 SPA, Lin purchased the Sold Stock for $27,000 (the "Purchase Price") from the Selling Shareholders in a private sale transaction (the "Private Sale"). The Selling Shareholders were our former sole officer and director: Thomas Hynes ("Hynes") and corporate secretary: Nina Bijedic ("Bijedic"). Pursuant to the 2014 SPA, Hynes and Bijedic submitted their resignations from all positions held with us; prior to the closing of the Private Sale, our Board of Directors appointed Lin as our sole director and Chief Executive Officer, which appointment took effect immediately following the close of the Private Sale. Following the Private Sale, a change in control occurred since Lin gained control of almost 52% of our outstanding common stock.
2015 Share Exchange
 
On July 15, 2015, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Steampunk Wizards Ltd., a company incorporated pursuant to the laws of Malta (“Malta Co.”), Lin, being the owner of record of 11,451,541 common shares (before the 2017 Reverse Stock Split) of the Company and the persons listed thereof (the “Shareholders”), being the owners of record of all of the issued share capital of Malta Co. (the “Steampunk Stock”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, upon surrender by the Shareholders and the cancellation by Malta Co. of the certificates evidencing the Steampunk Stock as registered in the name of each Shareholder, and pursuant to the registration of us in the register of members maintained by Malta Co. as the new holder of the Steampunk Stock and the issuance of the certificates evidencing the aforementioned registration of the Steampunk Stock in the name of us, on August 21, 2015, we issued 4,812,209 shares (the “New Shares”) (before the 2017 Reverse Stock Split) (subject to adjustment for fractionalized shares as set forth below) of our common to the Shareholders (or their designees), and Lin caused 10,096,229 shares (before the 2017 Reverse Stock Split) of our common stock that he owned (the “Lin Stock,” together with the New Shares, the “Acquisition Stock”) to be transferred to the Shareholders (or their designees), which collectively represented 55% of the issued and outstanding common stock of us immediately after the Closing, in exchange for the Steampunk Stock, representing 100% of the issued share capital of Malta Co. As a result of the exchange of the Steampunk Stock for the Acquisition Stock (the “Share Exchange”), Malta Co. became a wholly owned subsidiary (the “Subsidiary”) of us and there was a change of control of us following the closing. The Shareholders of Malta Co. owned approximately 55% of our issued and outstanding common stock. There were no warrants, options or other equity instruments issued in connection with the Exchange Agreement.
 
Malta Co. was incorporated in 2014 to acquire the intellectual property (IP) related to an unfinished game called “Tangled Tut.” Making full use of the team’s experience and diverse talent set, the company built the first mobile game with 3D printable rewards embedded and the associated IP and server technology.
 
Through Malta Co, we became an independent games development and technology company that specialized in developing enchanting games and gaming technology where the real and virtual worlds blur.  We launched a mobile casual game called Bungee Mummy – Challenges, designed primarily for smartphones and tablets (supporting both Android and IOS), in late August of 2015.
 
On January 29, 2016, Lin resigned from his CEO and sole director positions with Tianci, and Mr. Joshua O’Cock became our CEO, CFO, Secretary and Director.
 
2016 Securities Sale and Spin-Off 
 
On October 13, 2016, we entered into a spin-off agreement (the “Spin-Off Agreement”) with Malta Co. and Praefidi Holdings Limited (the “Buyer”), an entity organized under the laws of Malta that was owned by Brendon Grunewald. Pursuant to the Spin-Off Agreement, the Buyer received all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Malta Co. and we received $2,000 as purchase price. The Buyer became the sole equity owner of Malta Co. and we had no further interest in Malta Co.
