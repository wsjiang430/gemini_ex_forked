Item 1. Business
Overview
We are designing and developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (“eVTOL”) aircraft for use in urban air mobility (“UAM”) networks. Our mission is to unlock the skies, freeing everyone to reimagine how they move and spend time. Our eVTOL aircraft are designed to be safe, sustainable, and quiet. Our production aircraft, Midnight, which we unveiled in November of 2022, is designed around our proprietary 12-tilt-6 aircraft configuration. This means that it has 12 propellers attached to 6 booms on a fixed wing with all 12 propellers providing vertical lift during take-off and landing and the forward 6 propellers tilting forward to cruise position to provide propulsion during forward flight with the wing providing aerodynamic lift like a conventional airplane. 
Midnight is designed to carry 4 passengers plus a pilot up to 100 miles at speeds up to 150 miles per hour, but is optimized for back-to-back short distance trips of around 20-miles, with a charging time of approximately 10 minutes between trips. We are working to certify Midnight with the FAA in late 2024 so that we can then enter into commercial service in 2025. 
Midnight is the evolution of our demonstrator eVTOL aircraft, Maker, which through its flight test program has helped validate our proprietary 12-tilt-6 aircraft configuration and certain key enabling technologies. The design of Midnight marries what we believe to be cutting-edge electric propulsion technology with state-of-the-art aircraft systems to deliver the key attributes of our eVTOL aircraft:
•Safety. High redundancy and simplified propulsion systems make for a significantly safer aircraft compared to a helicopter. Midnight has no single critical point of failure, meaning that should any single component fail, the aircraft can still safely complete its flight.
•Low noise. With its intended cruising altitude at approximately 2,000 feet, the design of Midnight is such that the noise that reaches the ground is expected to measure around 45 A-weighted decibels, approximately 100 times quieter than that of a helicopter. During forward flight, the aircraft’s tilt propellers spin on axes that are aligned with the oncoming air flow, rather than edge-wise to the flow, as is the case with traditional helicopters - further decreasing noise levels. Since Archer’s aircraft is spinning 12 small propellers rather than one large rotor, it can also spin them at significantly lower tip speeds, resulting in much lower noise levels.
•Sustainable. Midnight is all electric, resulting in zero operating emissions. Archer is committed to sourcing renewable energy wherever possible to power its aircraft. Archer’s design and engineering teams have worked to integrate materials into this aircraft that have their own unique sustainability stories. For example, Midnight’s seats are constructed out of “flax” fiber, a natural plant which requires very little irrigation and is highly absorbent of CO2. In addition, Archer’s design uses fabric made from recycled contents like plastic bottles.
We continue to work to optimize our eVTOL aircraft design for both manufacturing and certification. The development of an eVTOL aircraft that meets our business requirements demands significant design and development efforts on all facets of the aircraft. We believe that by bringing together a mix of talent with eVTOL, traditional commercial aerospace, as well as electric propulsion backgrounds, we have built a team that enables us to move through the design, development, and certification of our eVTOL aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) in an efficient manner, thus allowing us to achieve our end goal of bringing to market our eVTOL aircraft as efficiently as possible.
Our Planned Lines of Business
Upon receipt of all necessary FAA certifications and any other government approvals necessary for us to manufacture and operate our aircraft, we intend to operate two complementary lines of business. Our core focus is to operate a direct-to-consumer aerial ride share service (“Archer UAM”) with our secondary focus being the sale of our aircraft to other operators (“Archer Direct”).
•Archer UAM. We plan to operate our own UAM ecosystem initially in select major U.S. cities. Our UAM ecosystem will operate using our eVTOL aircraft, which is currently in development. We project that the cost to manufacture and operate our eVTOL aircraft will be such that it will be able to enter the UAM ride-sharing market at a price point that is competitive with ground-based ride sharing services today. We will continue to evaluate our go-to-market strategy

based on, among other things, estimated demand, readiness of the required infrastructure, and our ability to scale our aircraft fleet.
•Archer Direct. We also plan to selectively sell a certain amount of our eVTOL aircraft to third parties. We have entered into a purchase agreement with United Airlines Inc. (“United”) for the conditional purchase of up to $1 billion worth of aircraft, with an option for another $500.0 million worth of aircraft (as amended, the “United Purchase Agreement”). 
As we get closer to commercialization, we will look to determine the right mix of selling our eVTOL aircraft versus using them as part of our UAM ecosystem based on, among other factors, our capital needs, our volume of manufacturing, our ability to ramp Archer UAM operations, and the purchase demand from our Archer Direct customers.
To date, we have not generated any revenue from either of these planned categories, as we continue to design, develop, and seek the governmental approvals necessary for our eVTOL aircraft to enter into service. We will use our cash and cash equivalents for the foreseeable future to continue to fund our efforts to bring our eVTOL aircraft to market. The amount and timing of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of the design and development of our aircraft and manufacturing operations, as well as our progress in obtaining necessary FAA certifications and other government approvals. For example, any significant delays in obtaining such FAA certifications and other government approvals will likely require us to raise additional capital above our existing cash on hand and delay our generation of revenues.
Manufacturing Operations & Supply Chain Build-Out
We are in the process of developing the infrastructure necessary to manufacture Midnight reliably, at scale, and in a cost effective manner. That involves two main aspects: developing the necessary component supply chain and building out our manufacturing operations. 
With regards to the sourcing of our components, a key aspect of our strategy has been to focus our internal component development efforts on only the key enabling technologies like our electric propulsion system and flight control software. For those areas that are not differentiating technologies we aim to leverage the existing aerospace supply base to supply us with components that are already being used in certified aircraft today. Throughout 2022, we continued to expand our portfolio of suppliers that will provide us with components for Midnight. We have also matured the design, development and manufacturing capabilities for our proprietary electric propulsion system. 
With regards to our manufacturing operations, we are currently in the final stages of building out a production facility in San Jose, California, which we will utilize to produce the initial Midnight aircraft we will use as part of our FAA certification program, as well as a higher volume production facility in Covington, Georgia. In November 2022, we announced our plans to locate our high volume production facility in Covington, Georgia at a site adjacent to the Covington Municipal Airport. At this site, we have begun construction on our initial build out a 350,000 square-foot facility on a 96-acre site. This initial facility is expected to be capable of producing up to 650 aircraft per year. We are targeting to complete construction in the second half of 2023 or early 2024 with initial production expected to begin in the second half of 2024. The facility will be capable of being expanded by an additional 550,000 square feet, which is estimated to support production of up to 2,300 aircraft per year. In selecting the location for this high volume manufacturing facility, we completed a comprehensive survey of potential sites across the United States. Key considerations included the availability of talent in the local labor market, utility availability, ability to conduct seamless flight test operations, construction costs, and logistics. In connection with the project, we agreed on an incentive package with the State of Georgia, Newton County and City of Covington, which includes land conveyance, tax incentives and Georgia REBA grant. We also anticipate that financing for this project will be provided by Synovus, the largest bank headquartered in the State of Georgia. As discussed in more detail below, we plan to work alongside Stellantis N.V. (“Stellantis”) on the build out and stand up this facility and our operations there. 
Key Strategic Partners
Archer was founded with a focus on commercializing the eVTOL aircraft industry. We identified early on that partnering with established players in adjacent industries was key to that commercialization strategy. 
Stellantis
In 2020, we established a key strategic relationship with Stellantis, one of the world’s leading automakers including of brands Jeep®, Ram, Maserati, Dodge, and Chrysler. The goal was to allow us to leverage Stellantis’ deep manufacturing,

supply chain, and design expertise in connection with our efforts to design, develop, and commercialize our eVTOL aircraft. In 2021, Stellantis invested in Archer as part of the Business Combination (as defined below). Then, in January 2023, we announced a significant expansion of our partnership. As a result, Stellantis will work with us to stand up our manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia. This unique approach will continue to leverage each company’s respective strengths and competencies in an effort to bring our Midnight aircraft to market at scale to support our commercialization plans. The goal over the long term is for Stellantis to mass produce our eVTOL aircraft as our contract manufacturer. As a further sign of its commitment, Stellantis has agreed to provide up to $150 million in equity capital for potential draw by Archer at its discretion in 2023 and 2024, subject to achievement of certain business milestones which Archer expects to occur in 2023. The two companies are taking these important steps together as we share the goal of redefining urban transportation.
United
In 2021, we established a key strategic relationship with United as part of the airline's broader effort to invest in emerging technologies that decarbonize air travel. The goal has been for United, as our flagship customer, to contribute its expertise in aircraft operations as we work together to commercialize our eVTOL aircraft. As part of establishing that relationship, we entered into a purchase agreement with United covering their purchase of up to $1.5 billion of our eVTOL aircraft. United has indicated its plans to acquire a fleet of our eVTOL aircraft that would be deployed in a manner to give their customers a quick, economical and low-carbon way to get to and from United's hub airports and commute in dense urban environments. United also invested in Archer as part of the Business Combination.
Since 2021, we have also been working closely with United on commercialization efforts. In April of 2022, we formed a joint eVTOL Advisory Committee to support operations of our eVTOL aircraft, including maintenance and operational standards. In August of 2022, United paid us $10 million in pre-delivery payments for 100 aircraft covered under our purchase agreement. Then, in November of 2022, we jointly announced the first specific UAM route in the US: Downtown Manhattan Heliport to Newark Liberty International Airport. Our shared purpose is connecting people, and we continue to work closely to ensure our eVTOL aircraft will amplify their broader efforts to do that in a sustainable way.
Market Opportunity
In 2018, 55% of the world’s population lived in urban areas according to the United Nations, a proportion that they projected to increase to 68% by 2050. This migration has led to unprecedented traffic congestion, with a noticeable struggle to scale ground infrastructure. UAM offers a potential solution by expanding travel into the air. To date, the electrification of aircraft has lagged the adoption of electric automobiles in large part because of the greater technical challenges. However, over the last few years there have been significant advancements in the key enabling technologies for eVTOL aircraft, such as high-energy batteries and high-performance electric motors. We anticipate that the initial market opportunity will be focused in high-density metropolitan areas where traffic congestion is particularly acute and operating conditions are suitable for early eVTOL aircraft operations. While we believe the market for eVTOL aircraft and UAM services will be large, it remains undeveloped and there is no guarantee of future demand. 
We believe the primary drivers for adoption of UAM services will be the time savings and value proposition offered by UAM relative to more traditional ground-based transportation options. We expect that the following additional factors will also impact the pace of adoption of UAM: regulatory requirements for eVTOL aircraft and UAM network operations, public acceptance of eVTOL aircraft (including perception regarding the safety of eVTOL aircraft) and access to the infrastructure necessary to enable UAM services. In addition, macroeconomic factors could impact demand for UAM services, particularly if more permanent work-from-home behaviors persist as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If the market for UAM does not develop as expected, this would impact our ability to generate revenue or grow our business.

Competition 
We believe our main sources of competition fall into three categories:
•ground-based vehicle transportation, including personal vehicles and ride-sharing services;
•other eVTOL manufacturers and UAM service providers; and
•existing incumbent aircraft and helicopter charter services.
Table of Contents

We believe the primary competitive factors between us and other eVTOL manufacturers and UAM service providers will be the following:
•eVTOL aircraft performance, including payload, noise, charging time, quality, reliability and safety;
•cost of the UAM service offering;
•eVTOL aircraft manufacturing capacity and efficiency, including the availability of raw materials and supplier parts necessary to manufacture eVTOL aircraft at scale;
•UAM service capabilities, including overall customer experience; and
•hiring the talent necessary to effectively design, develop, certify and commercialize eVTOL aircraft. 
While we believe we will be able to compete favorably across these factors, we expect this industry to be dynamic and increasingly competitive and it is possible that our competitors could get to market before us, either generally or in specific markets. For additional information about competition, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.
Government Regulation and Compliance 
In the near-term, we will continue to focus our efforts on obtaining certification of our aircraft in the U.S. and engaging with key decision makers in the U.S. cities in which we plan to initially operate our aircraft. Our aircraft will be required to comply with regulations governing aircraft design, production and airworthiness. In the U.S., this primarily includes regulations put forth by the FAA and Department of Transportation (“DOT”). Outside the U.S., similar requirements are generally administered by the national civil aviation and transportation authorities of each country. The following describes the key certifications necessary for us to design, manufacture, sell and operate our eVTOL aircraft in the United States:
•Designing our aircraft: Type Certification is the FAA’s approval process for new aircraft designs and covers the design of the aircraft and all component parts. Our aircraft will be required to meet the criteria set forth by the FAA through its “special class” process under Part 21.17(b). The first step is agreeing to the certification basis. In November of 2022, we finalized our agreement to that certification basis with the FAA through a G-1 Issue Paper. As part of the FAA’s Type Certification process for a special class aircraft, the Airworthiness Criteria (i.e., the certification requirements for the particular aircraft) must then be published in the Federal Register for public comment. In December of 2022, the proposed Airworthiness Criteria for our Midnight aircraft were published in the Federal Register by the FAA. Following the comment period, the FAA will finalize those Airworthiness Criteria. The next step is to agree on the Means of Compliance with the FAA. As a reminder, the Means of Compliance is the detailed list of design, analysis and testing standards that will be used to demonstrate that the aircraft is safe and complies with the Airworthiness Criteria. We submitted a comprehensive proposal for Midnight’s Means of Compliance to the FAA back in December of 2021. Since our last update, many more of our Means of Compliance have been agreed to with the FAA resulting in a majority having now been agreed to. Based on our technical discussions with the subject matter experts at the FAA, we don’t see any significant design risks with the remaining Means of Compliance areas that have not yet been agreed to. Over the coming weeks and months, we will continue to work with the FAA to close out our remaining Means of Compliance. As we’ve discussed previously, we are working in parallel with the FAA to review and agree on our subject specific certification plans (“SSCPs”). SSCPs provide precise detail on each of the specific tests and analyses that will be completed during the implementation phase of the project, in which we actually demonstrate to the FAA that Midnight meets all relevant FAA requirements necessary to receive Type Certification. We have now submitted a number of our SSCPs to the FAA and are targeting to submit the remaining SSCPs on a rolling basis between now and the end of April.
•Producing our aircraft: Production certification is the FAA’s approval for us to be able to manufacture our aircraft under an FAA-approved type design. To obtain production certification from the FAA, we must demonstrate that our organization and our personnel, facilities, and quality system can produce our aircraft such that they conform to its approved design. As discussed above, we are working to develop the systems and processes we will need to obtain FAA production certification with the goal of obtaining such certification shortly following receipt of our Type Certification.
Table of Contents

•Selling our aircraft: Airworthiness certification from the FAA signifies that an aircraft meets its approved type design and is in a condition for safe operation in the National Airspace System. As is the industry standard, each of the aircraft manufactured by us will need to be issued an airworthiness certificate. We expect that the airworthiness certificates issued to our aircraft will be a Standard Airworthiness certificate in the Normal Category, as defined by the FAA.
•Operating our UAM service: The DOT and the FAA have regulatory authority over air transportation operations in the United States. To operate our UAM service, we believe we will be required to hold an FAA Air Carrier Certificate and operate under Part 135 of the FARs and register as an air taxi operator at DOT. In addition, takeoff and landing locations (e.g., airports and heliports) typically require state and local approval for zoning and land use and their ongoing use are subject to regulations by local authorities. Lastly, we will need to ensure we have sufficient commercial pilots available for our planned operations. We expect that as we build out our UAM service there will be additional federal, state and local laws, regulations and other requirements that will cover our operations. Therefore, we have already begun, and will continue to grow, our engagement and collaboration with the cities in which we intend to operate our UAM service in an effort to ensure that it operates in a safe manner.
We believe we are in material compliance with laws and regulations currently applicable to our business. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect compliance to have a material adverse effect on our business. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for a more comprehensive description of risks related to government regulation affecting our business. 
Facilities
We are currently headquartered in San Jose, California with additional offices, research and development facilities, flight test facilities and manufacturing facilities in Palo Alto, Mountain View, San Jose, and Salinas, California, as well as in Covington, Georgia. See the “Manufacturing Operations & Supply Chain Build-Out” section above for more information on the planned build out of our manufacturing facilities.
Our Employees and Human Capital
Our strategy has been and continues to be to hire top talent across various disciplines to build the best eVTOL aircraft and UAM service possible. We believe we have assembled a world-class team with extensive experience in aerodynamics, electric propulsion, batteries, and aircraft manufacturing, as well as key personnel necessary to help us ensure that we progress efficiently through the certification of our aircraft and towards the commercialization of our business. The fabric of this team is that we are curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity and encourage the iteration of ideas to address the complex challenges our industry faces. We believe our team and culture differentiates us versus our competitors and will be a key driver of our long-term success. 
Because we recognize that our people are critical for our continued success, we work hard to create an environment where employees can have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. Furthermore, we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion a part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the cities we plan to serve. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had a workforce of 483 people, including 390 full-time employees and 93 contingent workers. We have not experienced any work stoppages and generally consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.
Intellectual Property
We rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual terms to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered and applied for the registration of U.S. and international trademarks, service marks and domain names. We have also filed patent applications in the United States and foreign countries covering certain of our technology. In general, our issued patents expire between 2040 and 2043.
