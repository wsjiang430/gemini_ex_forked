Item 1. Business. 
The Company
 
Uniti Group Inc. (the “Company”, “Uniti”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the state of Maryland on September 4, 2014. Uniti is an independent, internally managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) engaged in the acquisition and construction of mission critical infrastructure in the communications industry. We are principally focused on acquiring and constructing fiber optic broadband networks, wireless communications towers, copper and coaxial broadband networks and data centers.
 On April 24, 2015, we were separated and spun-off (the “Spin-Off”) from Windstream Holdings, Inc. (“Windstream Holdings” and together with its subsidiaries, “Windstream”) pursuant to which Windstream contributed certain telecommunications network assets, including fiber and copper networks and other real estate (the “Distribution Systems”) and a small consumer competitive local exchange carrier (“CLEC”) business (the “Consumer CLEC Business”) to Uniti and Uniti issued common stock and indebtedness and paid cash obtained from borrowings under Uniti’s senior credit facilities to Windstream. In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into a long-term exclusive triple-net lease (the “Master Lease”) with Windstream, pursuant to which a substantial portion of our real property is leased to Windstream and from which a substantial portion of our leasing revenues are currently derived. 
 
Uniti operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, which includes income derived from the Master Lease.  We have elected to treat the subsidiaries through which we operate our fiber business, Uniti Fiber, and Talk America Services, LLC, which operates the Consumer CLEC Business (“Talk America”), as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”).  TRSs enable us to engage in activities that result in income that does not constitute qualifying income for a REIT.  Our TRSs are subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes.
 
The Company operates through a customary up-REIT structure, pursuant to which we hold substantially all of our assets through a partnership, Uniti Group LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), that we control as general partner. This structure is intended to facilitate future acquisition opportunities by providing the Company with the ability to use common units of the Operating Partnership as a tax-efficient acquisition currency. As of December 31, 2018, we are the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and own approximately 97.7% of the partnership interests in the Operating Partnership.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had revenues of $1,017.6 million, net income attributable to common shareholders of $8.0 million, Funds From Operations (“FFO”) of $373.7 million and Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) of $443.8 million. Both FFO and AFFO are non-GAAP financial measures, which we use to analyze our results. Refer to Part II, Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report for additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures. As of December 31, 2018, we managed our operations in four reportable business segments, which are described in more detail in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
Business
 
We are an independent, internally-managed REIT engaged in the acquisition and construction of mission critical infrastructure in the communications industry. We manage our operations in four separate lines of business: Uniti Fiber, Uniti Towers, Uniti Leasing and Talk America. 
 
Refer to Part II, Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Significant Business Developments, of this Annual Report for additional information regarding significant developments in our business in 2018.

Uniti Fiber
 
Uniti Fiber is a leading provider of infrastructure solutions, including cell site backhaul and small cell for wireless operators and ethernet, wavelengths and dark fiber for telecommunications carriers and enterprises. With Uniti Fiber, our goal is to capitalize on the rising demand by carriers and enterprises for dark fiber, establish ourselves as a proven small-cell systems provider and leverage wholesale enterprise opportunities as well as opportunities through the School and Libraries Program (commonly referred to as E-Rate) administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company. We believe fiber is the mission-critical focal point in the modern communications infrastructure industry and that Uniti Fiber will accelerate our growth and diversification strategy and expand our relationships with high quality national and international wireless carriers.  
 
At December 31, 2018, Uniti Fiber’s revenues under contract were over $1.3 billion, with a network consisting of 1.7 million strand miles of fiber and approximately 18,200 customer connections.  Results for Uniti Fiber are reported in our consolidated financial statements in our Fiber Infrastructure business segment.
 
Uniti Towers
 
Uniti Towers’ primary business is constructing and leasing space on communications towers to wireless service providers and other tenants in a number of other industries. Uniti Towers’ leadership has substantial experience in the telecommunications industry and has been overseeing construction and operation of thousands of wireless towers both domestically and abroad for decades. Uniti Towers provides build-to-suit opportunities using customized master lease agreements designed for long-term carrier partnerships. We believe that our strategy of focusing on fiber and towers through Uniti Fiber and Uniti Towers is highly synergistic and will drive incremental growth opportunities. 
 
At December 31, 2018, Uniti Towers’ portfolio consisted of 430 wireless communications towers located in 26 states across the eastern and central regions in the United States, and 498 wireless communications towers in Latin America.  Results for Uniti Towers are reported in our consolidated financial statements in our Towers business segment.
 
On February 19, 2019, the Company announced it had agreed to sell Uniti Towers’ Latin America business to an entity controlled by Phoenix Towers International (“PTI”) for cash consideration of approximately $100 million. PTI will acquire approximately 500 towers located across Mexico, Colombia and Nicaragua. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2019.
 
Uniti Leasing
 
Uniti Leasing is engaged in acquiring mission-critical communications assets, such as fiber, data centers, next-generation consumer broadband, coaxial and upgradeable copper, and leasing them back to anchor customers on either an exclusive or shared-tenant basis.  Presently, a substantial portion of Uniti Leasing’s revenue is rental revenues from leasing the Distribution Systems to Windstream pursuant to the Master Lease.  We believe our attractive cost of capital and advantaged REIT structure will enable Uniti Leasing to provide creative and tax-efficient solutions to additional customers, including (i) sale leaseback transactions, whereby Uniti Leasing acquires existing infrastructure assets from communications service providers and leases them back on a long-term basis; (ii) capital investment financing, whereby Uniti Leasing offers communications service providers a cost-efficient method of raising funds for discrete capital investments to upgrade or expand their network; and (iii) mergers and acquisitions financing, whereby Uniti Leasing facilitates mergers and acquisition transactions as a capital partner.  Results for Uniti Leasing are reported in our consolidated financial statements in our Leasing business segment.
Talk America
 
We conduct the Consumer CLEC Business through Talk America Services, LLC. Talk America provides local telephone, high-speed Internet and long-distance service to approximately 22,500 customers principally located in 17 states across the eastern and central United States. Substantially all of the network assets used to provide these services to customers are contracted through interconnection agreements with other telecommunications carriers.

Results for Talk America are reported in our consolidated financial statements in our Consumer CLEC business segment.
 
Industry
 
The current communications infrastructure industry is marked by the growing demand for and use of bandwidth-intensive devices and applications, such as smart devices, real-time and online streaming video, cloud-based applications, social media and mobile broadband. This growth in consumption requires the support of robust communications infrastructure, of which fiber networks and communications towers are critical components. Substantial investments have been made in recent years in fiber networks, lit services and colocation facilities to keep pace with the increased bandwidth use of both enterprise- and consumer-end users. As companies attempt to keep pace with this rapidly evolving business sector, communications infrastructure continues to increase in priority and economic importance. We believe this considerable demand creates tremendous opportunities for us as an acquirer and operator and as a funding source for operators seeking to capitalize on these trends through build outs and acquisitions of infrastructure assets.
 
The wireless communications industry is a prime example of the growing importance of the bandwidth infrastructure industry. As wireless traffic and mobile data consumption continue to grow worldwide, participants in the wireless communications industry are increasing their network capacity through the development of new wireless cell sites and the addition of bandwidth capacity.  Consumers are demanding network quality and coverage, and as a result wireless carriers are making significant capital investments to improve quality, expand their coverage and remain relevant in a highly competitive industry. We expect this continued growth in capital expenditures to generate high demands for wireless towers (including strong growth in long-term tower leasing), tower space and bandwidth infrastructure services. 
 
Strategy 
 
Our primary goal is to create long-term stockholder value by (i) generating reliable and growing cash flows, (ii) diversifying our tenant and asset base, (iii) paying a dividend, and (iv) maintaining our financial strength and liquidity. To achieve this goal, we employ a business strategy that leverages our first mover advantages in the sector and our strong access to the capital markets. The key components of our business strategy are: 
Acquire Additional Infrastructure Assets Through Sale Leaseback Transactions 
 
We actively seek to acquire communications infrastructure assets from communication service providers and lease these assets back to the communication service providers on a long-term basis. We believe this type of transaction benefits the communication service providers with incremental liquidity which can be used to reduce indebtedness or for other investments, while they continue to focus on their existing business. We will employ a disciplined, opportunistic acquisition strategy and seek to price transactions appropriately based on, among other things, growth opportunities, the mix of assets acquired, length and terms of the lease, and credit worthiness of the tenant. 
 
This strategy will also expand our mix of tenants and other real property and will reduce our revenue concentration with Windstream. We expect that this objective will be achieved over time as part of our overall strategy to acquire new distribution systems and other real property within the communications infrastructure industry to further diversify our overall portfolio.
 
Capitalize on the Market Demand for Increased Bandwidth Infrastructure and Performance
 
Bandwidth intensive devices and applications are rapidly fueling worldwide consumption of bandwidth, which in turn fuels a continuously growing demand for stable and secure bandwidth options.  Communications service providers and other enterprises whose services and businesses require substantial amounts of bandwidth are increasingly looking to infrastructure providers to support their bandwidth needs and to expand the reach, performance and security of their networks.  We believe Uniti Fiber is well positioned to capitalize on this ongoing demand for bandwidth infrastructure solutions.
 
7

Fund Capital Extensions to Existing and New Tenants for Improvements of Infrastructure Assets 
 
We believe the communications infrastructure industry in the United States is currently going through an upgrade cycle driven by consumers’ general desire for greater bandwidth and wireless services. These upgrades require significant capital expenditures, and we believe Uniti provides an attractive, non-competitive funding source for communication service providers to help accelerate the improvement and expansion of their networks at an attractive cost of capital. 
 
We intend to support our tenant operators and other communication service providers by providing capital to them for a variety of purposes, including capacity augmentation projects, tower construction and network expansions. We expect to structure these investments as lease arrangements that produce additional rents. 
 
Facilitate M&A Transactions in the Communication Service Sector as a Capital Partner 
 
We believe Uniti can provide cost efficient funds to potential acquirers in the communication service sector, and thereby facilitate M&A transactions as a capital partner, including by partnering with operators through use of “OpCo-PropCo” structures, pursuant to we acquire the underlying network and other assets and the operator acquires the operations. The highly fragmented nature of the communication service sector is expected to result in more consolidation, which we believe will provide us ample opportunity to pursue these types of transactions. 
 
Maintain Balance Sheet Strength and Liquidity 
 
We seek to maintain a capital structure that provides the resources and financial flexibility to position us to capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. Our access to, and cost of, external capital is dependent on various factors, including general market conditions, credit ratings on our securities, interest rates and expectations of our future business performance. We intend to maintain a strong balance sheet through disciplined use of leverage, aiming to lower our relative cost of capital over time, and continuing to have access to multiple sources of capital and liquidity. As of December 31, 2018, we had $38.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and $110 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, although we have since drawn substantially all of our revolver capacity. As of December 31, 2018, with the exception of our revolving credit facility, all of our debt is either fixed-rate debt, or floating-rate debt that we have fixed through the use of interest rate swaps. 
Competition 
 
We compete for investments in the communications industry with telecommunications companies, investment companies, private equity funds, hedge fund investors, sovereign funds and other REITs who focus primarily on specific segments of the communications infrastructure industry. The communications infrastructure industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including many local, regional and global corporations.  Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we have. In addition, revenues from our network properties are dependent, to an extent, on the ability of our operating partners, like Windstream, to compete with other communication service providers. 
 
However, we believe we are positioned to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives and that we have significant competitive advantages that support our leadership position in owning, funding the construction of and leasing communications infrastructure, including: 
 
First-Mover Advantage; Uniquely Positioned to Capitalize on Expansion Opportunities 
 
We are the first and only REIT primarily focused on the acquisition and construction of mission critical infrastructure in the communications industry. We believe this provides us with a significant first-mover competitive advantage to capitalize on the large and fragmented communications infrastructure industry. Additionally, we believe our position, scale and national reach will help us achieve operational efficiencies and support future growth opportunities.

Large Scale Anchor Tenant
 
We believe the assets we lease to Windstream under the Master Lease are critical for Windstream to successfully run its business and operations, and that Windstream will need the assets subject to the Master Lease while it undergoes its restructuring as set forth under “Risk Factors”. Windstream, as our anchor tenant, provides us with a base of rent revenues as an initial platform for us to grow and diversify our portfolio and tenant base.  
 
Windstream is a publicly-traded company that provides advanced network communications and technology solutions for businesses across the United States. Windstream also offers broadband, entertainment and security solutions to consumers and small businesses primarily in rural areas. Windstream continues to operate the Distribution Systems, hold the associated regulatory licenses and own and operate other assets, including distribution systems in select states not included in the Spin-Off. 
 
Windstream has a diverse customer base, encompassing enterprise and small business customers, carriers and consumers. The Distribution Systems we lease to Windstream are located in 29 different states across the continental United States. The fiber assets in any one state do not account for more than 20% of the total route miles in our network. We believe this geographic diversification will limit the effect of changes in any one market on our overall performance. 
 
Windstream is subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, which include the requirements to file annual reports containing audited financial information and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial information. Windstream’s filings with the SEC can be found at www.sec.gov. Windstream’s filings are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. 
 
Strong Relationships with Communication Service Providers 
 
Members of our management team have developed an extensive network of relationships with qualified local, regional and national communication service providers across the United States. This extensive network has been built by our management team through decades of operating experience, involvement in industry trade organizations and the development of banking relationships and investor relations within the communications infrastructure industry. We believe these strong relationships will allow us to effectively source investment opportunities from communication service providers other than Windstream. We intend to work collaboratively with our operating partners in providing expansion capital at attractive rates to help them achieve their growth and business objectives. We will seek to partner with communication service providers who possess local market knowledge, demonstrate hands-on management and have proven track records. 
Experienced and Committed Management Team 
 
Our senior management team is comprised of veteran leaders with strong backgrounds in their respective disciplines. Our senior management team has extensive experience managing telecommunications operations, consummating mergers and acquisitions and accessing both debt and equity capital markets to fund growth and maintain a flexible capital structure. 
Insurance 
 
We maintain, or will require in our leases (including the Master Lease), that our tenants maintain, all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. Under the Master Lease, Windstream has the right to self-insure or use a captive provider with respect to its insurance obligations. We believe that the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants are customary for similarly situated companies in the telecommunications industry. However, our tenants may elect not to, or be able to, maintain the required insurance coverages, and the failure by any of them to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. We may not continue to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our leases, including the Master Lease, and such insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost in the future or fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event.  Moreover, we cannot guarantee the future financial viability of the insurers.

Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we had 798 full-time employees.  Except for 18 employees in Mexico, none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 
Significant Customers
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, 68.2%, 74.8% and 87.9% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from leasing our Distribution Systems to Windstream Holdings pursuant to the Master Lease.  
 
On February 25, 2019, Windstream filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.  For a discussion of the impact that Windstream’s bankruptcy may have on the Master Lease, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement
 
U.S. Telecommunications Regulatory Overview
 
Market Overview
 
Our subsidiaries and our tenants operate in a regulated market.  As operators of telecommunications facilities and services, both we and the current and future tenants of our telecommunications assets are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local telecommunications laws and regulations. The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulates the provision of interstate and international telecommunications services, and state public utility commissions (“PUCs”) regulate intrastate telecommunications services. Federal and state telecommunications laws and regulations are wide-ranging, and violations of them can subject us and our tenants to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. We expect that the telecommunications industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation. Changes in laws and regulations and violations of federal or state laws or regulations by us or our tenants could have a significant direct or indirect effect on our operations and financial condition, as detailed below and set forth under “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.” 
 
Our operations require that certain of our subsidiaries across all segments hold licenses or other forms of authorization from the FCC and state PUCs in those states where we operate, and in some jurisdictions our subsidiaries must file tariffs or other price lists describing their rates, terms and conditions of the services they provide.  The FCC and PUCs can modify or terminate a service provider’s license or other authority to provide telecommunications services for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.  The FCC and PUCs may also investigate our subsidiaries’ operations and may impose fines or other penalties for violations of the same.  In addition, our subsidiaries are required to submit periodic reports to the FCC and PUCs documenting their revenues and other data.  Some of this information is used as the basis for the imposition of various regulatory fees and other assessments. In order to engage in certain transactions in some jurisdictions, including changes of control, the encumbrance of certain assets, the issuance of securities, the incurrence of indebtedness, the guarantee of indebtedness of other entities, including subsidiaries of ours, and the transfer of assets, we are required to provide notice and/or obtain prior approval from certain governmental agencies.  Failure to obtain such approvals could subject us to fines or other penalties. 
 
Our subsidiaries are subject to a number of federal and state regulations that govern the way we can conduct our business.  Such regulations also impose certain operating costs on our businesses.  These regulations can include restrictions on pricing flexibility for certain products, minimum service quality standards, service reporting, intercarrier compensation, contributions to universal service, and other obligations.   
 
We have sought to structure the operations for our core real estate business in a manner that will not require us to become regulated as a public utility or common carrier by the FCC or PUCs, but a number of our business operations are nonetheless subject to federal, state, and local regulation, and we cannot guarantee that our core real estate business will not become further subject to federal, state, and local regulation in the future.

Consumer CLEC Business
 
Talk America operates the Consumer CLEC Business as a reseller of telecommunication services pursuant to a Wholesale Master Services Agreement and a Master Service Agreement with Windstream.  In almost all cases, Windstream does not own the underlying telecommunication facilities required to support the Consumer CLEC Business, rather it is a reseller of facility-based services pursuant to wholesale interconnection agreements with third-party carriers that own the underlying telecommunication facilities. Talk America is authorized and regulated as a CLEC and an interexchange (long-distance) service provider in most states where it has Consumer CLEC Business customers. These certifications subject Talk America to regulations requiring it to file and maintain tariffs for the rates charged to its Consumer CLEC Business customers for regulated services and to comply with service quality, service reporting and other regulatory obligations. Talk America’s ability to operate the Consumer CLEC Business is dependent on existing telecommunication regulations that allow access to such underlying facilities of other carriers at reasonable rates.  The FCC is considering proposals to eliminate the requirement that incumbent local exchange carriers offer unbundled network elements to companies like Windstream and Talk America.  We cannot predict how the FCC will resolve those proposals, nor whether such network elements will continue to be available in the future at the rates they are available today.
 
With respect to the broadband Internet services that we provide, traditionally, the FCC has recognized that broadband Internet access services are “information services” subject to limited regulation. In 2015, the FCC issued a “network neutrality” decision that declared broadband Internet access services to be subject to certain “telecommunications services” regulation under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. These regulations would have limited the ways that broadband Internet access service providers could structure business arrangements and manage their networks and spurred additional restrictions, including rate regulation, which could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation. In 2017, the FCC voted to return broadband Internet access service to its prior classification as “information services.” As a result of these decisions, state legislators and governors have introduced, and in some cases passed, state laws and executive orders requiring different levels of adherence to “network neutrality” principles for broadband Internet access service providers active in the applicable states. As a result of these laws and regulations, it is unclear at this time how broadband services will be regulated in the future, and the potential impact those regulations may have on our broadband Internet service business.
 
Uniti Towers 
 
Uniti Towers is subject to international, federal, state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration, siting, construction, lighting, marking and maintenance of our towers. In the United States, the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require pre-approval by the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields. Towers requiring pre-approval must be registered with the FCC and maintained in accordance with FCC and FAA standards. Similar requirements regarding pre-approval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries where Uniti Towers owns and operates towers. Non-compliance with applicable tower-related requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders.
 
Regulatory regimes outside of the United States and its territories vary by country and locality; however, these regulations typically require approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Additionally, some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting, lighting and maintenance. Our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas. Non-compliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders. Our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters. 
 
In all countries where Uniti Towers operates, it is subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations. While these regulations vary, they typically require approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Opposition by local zoning authorities and community residents can delay or prevent new tower construction or site upgrade projects, thereby increasing the costs and timing of new tower construction and modifications or site upgrades. 
 
11

The failure to properly maintain towers pursuant to applicable regulatory requirements, such as but not limited to, lighting, painting, and other safety standards, can subject us to significant enforcement actions, including monetary penalties both within the United States and abroad.
 
Uniti Fiber
 
Our subsidiaries that compose Uniti Fiber own and operate significant fiber and other communications backhaul facilities throughout various regions of the United States. The provision of such services is subject to FCC and PUC licensure in many jurisdictions, and the companies are typically licensed as CLECs and/or interexchange carriers in those states where they operate.  The companies also hold various FCC wireless licenses in order to provide microwave backhaul services.  Because of the nature of the licenses that these companies hold, and the nature of the services that they provide, they are subject to various federal and state regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, revenue and other reporting requirements and tariffing requirements.  The companies must also maintain their wireless licenses with the FCC, which requires construction and notification reporting and other regulatory requirements.  New fiber network construction is also subject to certain state and local governmental permitting and licensing requirements.  Delays in the local and state permitting process can delay the construction of new facilities.  Failure to abide by permit requirements can subject the company to fines and other penalties.   
Regulatory Changes
 
Future revenues, costs and capital investment in the communication businesses of our tenants, Talk America, Uniti Fiber, Uniti Towers, and other related entities could be adversely affected by material changes to, or decisions regarding applicability of, government requirements, including, but not limited to, changes in rules governing inter-carrier compensation, interconnection access to network facilities, state and federal universal service fund (“USF”) support, rules governing the prices that can be charged for business data services, infrastructure location and siting rules, access to unbundled network elements, and other requirements.  Federal and state communications laws and regulations may be amended in the future, and other new laws and regulations may affect our business.  In addition, certain laws and regulations applicable to us and our competitors may be, and have been, challenged in the courts and could be vacated or modified at any time. We cannot predict future developments or changes to the regulatory environment or the impact such developments or changes would have on our business. 
 
In addition, regulations could create significant compliance costs for us.  Delays in obtaining FCC and PUC certifications and regulatory approvals could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses, and conditions imposed in connection with such approvals could adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge our customers. Both our subsidiaries and our tenants may also be affected by legislation and/or regulation imposing new or additional obligations related to, for example, law enforcement assistance, cyber-security protection, intellectual property rights protections, environmental protections, consumer privacy, tax, or other areas.  We cannot predict how any such future changes may impact our business, or the business of our tenants.
 
Environmental Matters 
 
A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect telecommunications operations and facilities. These laws and regulations, and their enforcement, involve complex and varied requirements, and many such laws and regulations impose strict liability for violations.  Some of these federal, state and local laws may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal property damages and the owner’s liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property and/or the assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral, which, in turn, could reduce revenues.
