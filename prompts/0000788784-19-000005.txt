ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in 1985 and our principal executive offices are located at 80 Park Plaza, Newark, New Jersey 07102. We conduct our business through two direct wholly owned subsidiaries, PSE&G and Power, each of which also has its principal executive offices at 80 Park Plaza, Newark, New Jersey 07102.
We are an energy company with a diversified business mix. Our operations are located primarily in the Northeastern and Mid- Atlantic United States. Our business approach focuses on operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment. As a holding company, our profitability depends on our subsidiaries’ operating results. Below are descriptions of our two principal direct operating subsidiaries.

PSE&G | Power 
A New Jersey corporation, incorporated in 1924, which is a franchised public utility in New Jersey. It is also the provider of last resort for gas and electric commodity service for end users in its service territory. Earns revenues from its regulated rate tariffs under which it provides electric transmission and electric and gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in its service territory. It also offers appliance services and repairs to customers throughout its service territory. Also invests in regulated solar generation projects and regulated energy efficiency and related programs in New Jersey. | A Delaware limited liability company formed in 1999 as a result of the deregulation and restructuring of the electric power industry in New Jersey. It integrates the operations of its merchant nuclear and fossil generating assets with its power marketing businesses and fuel supply functions through competitive energy sales in well-developed energy markets. Earns revenues from the generation and marketing of power and natural gas to hedge business risks and optimize the value of its portfolio of power plants, other contractual arrangements and oil and gas storage facilities. This is achieved primarily by selling power and transacting in natural gas and other energy-related products, on the spot market or using short-term or long-term contracts for physical and financial products. Also earns revenues from solar generation facilities under long-term sales contracts for power and environmental products.

Our other direct wholly owned subsidiaries are: PSEG Long Island LLC (PSEG LI), which operates the Long Island Power Authority’s (LIPA) electric transmission and distribution (T&D) system under a contractual agreement; PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings), which earns its revenues primarily from its portfolio of lease investments; and PSEG Services Corporation (Services), which provides us and our operating subsidiaries with certain management, administrative and general services at cost.
The following is a more detailed description of our business, including a discussion of our:

• | Business Operations and Strategy


• | Competitive Environment


• | Employee Relations


• | Regulatory Issues


• | Environmental Matters

BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY
PSE&G
Our regulated transmission and distribution (T&D) public utility, PSE&G, distributes electric energy and gas to customers within a designated service territory running diagonally across New Jersey where approximately 6.2 million people, or about 70% of New Jersey’s population resides.
Products and Services
Our utility operations primarily earn margins through the T&D of electricity and the distribution of gas.

• | Transmission—the movement of electricity at high voltage from generating plants to substations and transformers, where it is then reduced to a lower voltage for distribution to homes, businesses and industrial customers. Our

2

revenues for these services are based upon tariffs approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

• | Distribution—the delivery of electricity and gas to the retail customer’s home, business or industrial facility. Our revenues for these services are based upon tariffs approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU).

The commodity portion of our utility business’ electric and gas sales is managed by basic generation service (BGS) and basic gas supply service (BGSS) suppliers. Pricing for those services is set by the BPU as a pass-through, resulting in no margin for our utility operations.
We also earn margins through competitive services, such as appliance repair, in our service territory.
In addition to our current utility products and services, we have implemented several programs to invest in regulated solar generation within New Jersey, including:

• | programs to help finance the installation of solar power systems throughout our electric service area, and


• | programs to develop, own and operate solar power systems.

We have also implemented a set of energy efficiency and demand response programs to encourage conservation and energy efficiency by providing energy and cost-saving measures directly to businesses and families. 
How PSE&G Operates
We are a transmission owner in PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) and we provide distribution service to 2.3 million electric customers and 1.8 million gas customers in a service area that covers approximately 2,600 square miles running diagonally across New Jersey. We serve the most densely populated, commercialized and industrialized territory in New Jersey, including its six largest cities and approximately 300 suburban and rural communities.
Transmission
We use formula rates for our transmission cost of service and investments. Formula-type rates provide a method of rate recovery where the transmission owner annually determines its revenue requirements through a fixed formula that considers Operation and Maintenance expenditures, rate base and capital investments and applies an approved return on equity (ROE) in developing the weighted average cost of capital. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in January of each year based upon our internal forecast of annual expenses and capital expenditures. Rates are subsequently trued up to reflect actual annual expenses and capital expenditures. Our current approved rates provide for a base ROE of 11.68% on existing and new transmission investment, while certain investments are entitled to earn an additional incentive rate. 
We continue to invest in transmission projects that are included for review in the FERC-approved PJM transmission expansion process. These projects focus on reliability improvements and replacement of aging infrastructure with planned capital spending of $3.4 billion for transmission in 2019-2021 as disclosed in Item 7. MD&A—Capital Requirements.    
Distribution
PSE&G distributes gas and electricity to end users in our respective franchised service territories. In October 2018, the BPU issued an Order approving the settlement of our distribution base rate proceeding with new rates effective November 1, 2018. The Order provides for a distribution rate base of $9.5 billion, a 9.60% ROE for our distribution business and a 54% equity component of our capitalization structure. The BPU has also approved a series of PSE&G infrastructure, energy efficiency and renewable energy investment programs with cost recovery through various clause mechanisms. Our load requirements are split among residential, commercial and industrial customers, as described in the following table for 2018:

 | % of 2018 Sales
Customer Type | Electric | Gas 
Commercial | 58% | 38% 
Residential | 33% | 58% 
Industrial | 9% | 4% 
Total | 100% | 100%

3

Our customer base has modestly increased since 2014, with electric and gas loads increasing as illustrated below: 

Electric and Gas Distribution Statistics | 
 | December 31, 2018 | 
 | Number ofCustomers | Electric Sales and Firm GasSales (A) | Historical Annual Load Growth 2014-2018
Electric | 2.3 | Million | 41,889 | Gigawatt hours (GWh) | 0.3%
Gas | 1.8 | Million | 2,630 | Million Therms | 1.7%


(A) | Excludes sales from Gas rate classes that do not impact margin, specifically Contract, Non-Firm Transportation, Cogeneration Interruptible and Interruptible Services.

Electric sales were essentially flat with increases due to growth in the number of customers and improved economic conditions offset by conservation and more energy efficient appliances. Firm gas sales increased as a result of growth in the number of customers and customer response to continued low gas prices. Only firm gas sales impact margin.
PSE&G completed its BPU-approved Energy Strong Program I (ES I) in 2018. Under ES I, PSE&G, at an investment of $1 billion, completed the replacement and modernization of 240 miles of low-pressure cast iron gas mains in or near flood areas. PSE&G upgraded all of its electric substations that were damaged by water in recent storms; made investments that will create redundancy in the electric distribution system, reducing outages when damage occurs; and deployed technologies to better monitor system operations, enabling PSE&G to restore customers more quickly in the event of an electric outage. Concerning PSE&G’s gas system, PSE&G upgraded five natural gas metering stations, two liquefied propane stations and a liquefied natural gas station affected by severe weather or located in flood zones.
In 2018, PSE&G also essentially completed its Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP I), which was approved by the BPU in late 2015. By June 2019, through GSMP I, we will have invested approximately $900 million to replace approximately 450 miles of cast iron and unprotected steel gas mains and about 40,000 unprotected steel service lines to homes and businesses, including uprating of the mains to higher pressure. The mains and service lines were replaced with stronger, more durable plastic piping, reducing the potential for leaks and release of methane gas. The new elevated pressure system also includes the installation of excess flow valves on each gas service that automatically shut off gas flow if a service line is abruptly damaged, and better supports the use of high-efficiency appliances.
In May 2018, PSE&G received approval for the Gas System Modernization Program II (GSMP II), an expanded, five-year program to invest $1.9 billion over five years beginning in 2019 to replace approximately 875 miles of cast iron and unprotected steel mains in addition to other improvements to the gas system.
In June 2018, we filed for our Energy Strong Program II (ES II), a proposed five-year $2.5 billion program to harden, modernize and make our electric and gas distribution systems more resilient. The size and duration of ES II, as well as certain other elements of the program, are subject to BPU approval. A procedural schedule has been issued with the review process expected to conclude in mid-2019.
In October 2018, we filed our proposed Clean Energy Future (CEF) program with the BPU, a six-year estimated $3.6 billion investment program covering four programs; (i) an Energy Efficiency (EE) program totaling $2.5 billion of investment designed to achieve energy efficiency targets required under New Jersey’s Clean Energy law; (ii) an Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure program; (iii) an Energy Storage (ES) program and (iv) an Energy Cloud (EC) program which will include installing approximately two million electric smart meters and associated infrastructure. The procedural process for the CEF-EE program is expected to conclude by the third quarter of 2019. The CEF-EV/ES and CEF-EC programs will have separate procedural schedules. For additional information regarding the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel’s motions related to these programs, see Item 7. MD&A—Executive Overview of 2018 and Future Outlook.
Solar Generation
To support New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan and the state’s renewable energy goals, we have undertaken two major solar initiatives at PSE&G, the Solar Loan Program and the Solar 4 All® Programs. Our Solar Loan Program provides solar system financing to our residential and commercial customers. The loans are repaid with cash or solar renewable energy certificates (SRECs). We sell the SRECs received through periodic auctions and use the proceeds to offset program costs. Our Solar 4 All® Programs invest in utility-owned solar photovoltaic (PV) centralized solar systems installed on PSE&G property and third-party sites, including landfill facilities, and solar panels installed on distribution system poles in our electric service territory. We sell the energy and capacity from the systems in the PJM wholesale electricity market. In addition, we sell SRECs generated by the projects through the same periodic auction used in the loan program, the proceeds of which are used to offset program costs.
4

Supply
Although commodity revenues make up almost 39% of our revenues, we make no margin on the default supply of electricity and gas since the actual costs are passed through to our customers.
All electric and gas customers in New Jersey have the ability to choose their electric energy and/or gas supplier. Pursuant to BPU requirements, we serve as the supplier of last resort for two types of electric and gas customers within our service territory that are not served by another supplier. The first type, which represents about 80% of PSE&G’s load requirements, provides default supply service for smaller commercial and industrial (C&I) customers and residential customers at seasonally-adjusted fixed prices for a three-year term (BGS-Residential Small Commercial Pricing (RSCP)). These rates change annually on June 1 and are based on the average price obtained at auctions in the current year and two prior years. The second type provides default supply for larger customers, with energy priced at hourly PJM real-time market prices for a contract term of 12 months (BGS-Commercial Industrial Energy Pricing).
We procure the supply to meet our BGS obligations through auctions authorized by the BPU for New Jersey’s total BGS requirement. These auctions take place annually in February. Results of these auctions determine which energy suppliers are authorized to supply BGS to New Jersey’s electric distribution companies (EDCs). Once validated by the BPU, electricity prices for BGS service are set. Approximately one-third of PSE&G’s total BGS-RSCP eligible load is auctioned each year for a three-year term. For information on current prices, see Item 8. Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. 
PSE&G procures the supply requirements of its default service BGSS gas customers through a full-requirements contract with Power. The BPU has approved a mechanism designed to recover all gas commodity costs related to BGSS for residential customers. BGSS filings are made annually by June 1 of each year, with an effective date of October 1. PSE&G’s revenues are matched with its costs using deferral accounting, with the goal of achieving a zero cumulative balance by September 30 of each year. In addition, we have the ability to put in place two self-implementing BGSS increases on December 1 and February 1 of up to 5% and also may reduce the BGSS rate at any time and/or provide bill credits. See Item 8. Note 7. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. Any difference between rates charged under the BGSS contract and rates charged to our residential customers is deferred and collected or refunded through adjustments in future rates. C&I customers that do not select third-party suppliers are also supplied under the BGSS arrangement. These customers are charged a market-based price largely determined by prices for commodity futures contracts.
Markets and Market Pricing
Historically, there has been significant volatility in commodity prices. Such fluctuations can have a considerable impact on us since a rising commodity price environment results in higher delivered electric and gas rates for customers. This could result in decreased demand for electricity and gas, increased regulatory pressures and greater working capital requirements as the collection of higher commodity costs from our customers may be deferred under our regulated rate structure. A declining commodity price, on the other hand, would be expected to have the opposite effect. 
Power
Through Power, we seek to produce low-cost electricity by efficiently operating our nuclear, coal, gas, oil-fired and renewable generation assets while balancing generation output, fuel requirements and supply obligations through energy portfolio management. Our commitments for load, such as BGS in New Jersey and other bilateral supply contracts, are backed by the generation we own and may be combined with the use of physical commodity purchases and financial instruments from the market to optimize the economic efficiency of serving the load. Power is a public utility within the meaning of the Federal Power Act (FPA) and the payments it receives and how it operates are subject to FERC regulation. 
Power is also subject to certain regulatory requirements imposed by state utility commissions such as those in New York and Connecticut.
Products and Services
As a merchant generator and power marketer, our profit is derived from selling a range of products and services under contract to an array of customers including utilities, other power marketers, such as retail energy providers, or counterparties in the open market. These products and services may be transacted bilaterally or through exchange markets and include but are not limited to:

• | Energy—the electrical output produced by generation plants that is ultimately delivered to customers for use in lighting, heating, air conditioning and operation of other electrical equipment. Energy is our principal product and is priced on a usage basis, typically in cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) or dollars per megawatt hour (MWh).

5


• | Capacity—distinct from energy, capacity is a market commitment that a given generation unit will be available to an Independent System Operator (ISO) for dispatch to produce energy when it is needed to meet system demand. Capacity is typically priced in dollars per MW for a given sale period (e.g. day or month).


• | Ancillary Services—related activities supplied by generation unit owners to the wholesale market that are required by the ISO to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the bulk power system. Owners of generation units may bid units into the ancillary services market in return for compensatory payments. Costs to pay generators for ancillary services are recovered through charges collected from market participants.


• | Congestion and Renewable Energy Credits—Congestion credits (or Financial Transmission Rights) are financial instruments that entitle the holder to a stream of revenues (or charges) based on the hourly congestion price differences across a transmission path. Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) are obtained through Power’s owned renewable generation or purchased in the open market. Electric suppliers of load are required to deliver a certain amount or percentage of their delivered power from renewable resources as mandated by applicable regulatory requirements.

Power also sells wholesale natural gas, primarily through a full-requirements BGSS contract with PSE&G to meet the gas supply requirements of PSE&G’s customers. In 2014, the BPU approved an extension of the long-term BGSS contract to March 31, 2019, and thereafter the contract remains in effect unless terminated by either party with a two-year notice.
Approximately 45% of PSE&G’s peak daily gas requirements is provided from Power’s firm gas transportation capacity, which is available every day of the year. Power satisfies the remainder of PSE&G’s requirements from storage contracts, liquefied natural gas, seasonal purchases, contract peaking supply and propane. Based upon the availability of natural gas beyond PSE&G’s daily needs, Power sells gas to others and uses it for its generation fleet.
Power also owns and operates 414 MW direct current (dc) of PV solar generation facilities and has an additional 52 MW dc of PV solar generation in construction. Power also has a 50% ownership interest in a 208 MW oil-fired generation facility in Hawaii. 
The remainder of this section about Power covers our nuclear and fossil fleet in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions which comprises the vast majority of Power’s operations and financial performance.
How Power’s Generation Operates
Nearly all of our generation capacity consists of nuclear and fossil generation (11,458 MW) that is located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States in some of the country’s largest and most developed electricity markets. For additional information see Item 2. Properties.
The map below shows the locations of our Northeast and Mid-Atlantic nuclear and fossil generation facilities, including the Bridgeport Harbor 5 (BH5) project currently under construction:

• | Generation Capacity

Our nuclear and fossil installed capacity utilizes a diverse mix of fuels. As of December 31, 2018, our fuel mix was comprised of 51% gas, 32% nuclear, 10% coal, 5% oil and 2% pumped storage. This fuel diversity helps to mitigate risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles. Our total generating output in 2018 was approximately 55,800 gigawatt hours (GWh). The generation mix by fuel type in recent years has reflected the relatively more favorable price of natural gas compared to coal. The following table indicates the proportionate share of generating output by fuel type in 2018.

Generation by Fuel Type (A) | Actual 2018 | 
Nuclear: | | 
New Jersey facilities | 37% | 
Pennsylvania facilities | 19% | 
Fossil: | | 
Natural Gas and Oil: | | 
New Jersey facilities | 21% | 
New York facilities | 9% | 
Maryland facilities | 4% | 
Connecticut facilities | —% | (B)
Coal: | | 
Pennsylvania facilities | 10% | 
Connecticut facilities | —% | (B)
Total | 100% | 


(A) | Excludes pumped storage, solar facilities and fossil generation in Hawaii which account for less than 2.5 percent of total generation. 

(B) Less than one percent. 
In mid-2018, we commenced commercial operations of our Keys Energy Center (Keys), a 761 MW gas-fired combined cycle generating station in Maryland and Sewaren 7, a 538 MW dual-fueled combined cycle generating station in New Jersey. 
In July 2018, Exelon, co-owner of the Peach Bottom nuclear facilities in Pennsylvania, submitted a second 20-year license renewal application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3. It is anticipated that the NRC’s review process will take approximately two years from submission of the application. Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3 are currently licensed to operate through 2033 and 2034, respectively.
In February 2016, the proposed generating facility, BH5, a 485 MW dual-fueled combined cycle generation project, was awarded a capacity obligation. Construction continues on BH5, which is targeted for commercial operation in mid-2019. 

• | Generation Dispatch

Our generation units have historically been characterized as serving one or more of three general energy market segments: base load; load following; and peaking, based on their operating capability and performance. 

• | Base Load Units run the most and typically are called to operate whenever they are available. These units generally derive revenues from both energy and capacity sales. Variable operating costs are low due to the combination of highly efficient operations and the use of relatively lower-cost fuels. Performance is generally measured by the unit’s “capacity factor,” or the ratio of the actual output to the theoretical maximum output. In 2018, the base load capacity factors for the following units were:

7


Unit | 2018CapacityFactor
Nuclear | 
Salem Unit 1 | 97.9% 
Salem Unit 2 | 84.6% 
Hope Creek | 88.8% 
Peach Bottom Unit 2 | 93.4% 
Peach Bottom Unit 3 | 94.2% 
Coal | 
Keystone | 83.4% 
Conemaugh | 76.9% 


• | Load Following Units’ operating costs are generally higher per unit of output than for base load units due to the use of higher-cost fuels such as oil, natural gas and, in some cases, coal or lower overall unit efficiency. These units usually have more flexible operating characteristics than base load units which enable them to more easily follow fluctuations in load. They operate less frequently than base load units and derive revenues from energy, capacity and ancillary services.


• | Peaking Units run the least amount of time and in some cases may utilize higher-priced fuels. These units typically start very quickly in response to system needs. Costs per unit of output tend to be higher than for base load units given the combination of higher heat rates and fuel costs. The majority of revenues are from capacity and ancillary service sales. The characteristics of these units enable them to capture energy revenues during periods of high energy prices.

In the energy markets in which we operate, owners of power plants specify to the ISO prices at which they are prepared to generate and sell energy based on the marginal cost of generating energy from each individual unit. The ISOs will generally dispatch in merit order, calling on the lowest variable cost units first and dispatching progressively higher-cost units until the point that the entire system demand for power (known as the system “load”) is satisfied reliably. Base load units are dispatched first, with load following units next, followed by peaking units. It should be noted that the sustained lower pricing of natural gas over the past several years has resulted in changes in relative operating costs compared to historical norms, enabling some gas-fired generation to displace some generation by other fuel types. This change, combined with the addition of new, more efficient generation capacity, has altered the historical dispatch order of certain plants in the markets where we operate.
During periods when one or more parts of the transmission grid are operating at full capability, thereby resulting in a constraint on the transmission system, it may not be possible to dispatch units in merit order without violating transmission reliability standards. Under such circumstances, the ISO may dispatch higher-cost generation out of merit order within the congested area, and power suppliers will be paid an increased Locational Marginal Price (LMP) in congested areas, reflecting the bid prices of those higher-cost generation units.
Typically, the bid price of the last unit dispatched by an ISO establishes the energy market-clearing price. After considering the market-clearing price and the effect of transmission congestion and other factors, the ISO calculates the LMP for every location in the system. The ISO pays all units that are dispatched their respective LMP for each MWh of energy produced, regardless of their specific bid prices. Since bids generally approximate the marginal cost of production, units with lower marginal costs typically generate higher gross margins than units with comparatively higher marginal costs.
This method of determining supply and pricing creates a situation where natural gas prices often have a major influence on the price that generators will receive for their output, especially in periods of relatively strong or weak demand. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas will often translate into changes in the wholesale price of electricity. This can be seen in the following graphs which present historical annual spot prices and forward calendar prices as averaged over each year at two liquid trading hubs. 
8

Historical data implies that the price of natural gas will continue to have a strong influence on the price of electricity in the primary markets in which we operate.
The prices reflected in the preceding graphs above do not necessarily illustrate our contract prices, but they are representative of market prices at relatively liquid hubs, with nearer-term forward pricing generally resulting from more liquid markets than pricing for later years. As shown above, prices may vary by location resulting from congestion or other factors, such as the availability of natural gas from the Marcellus (Leidy) and other shale-gas regions. These variations can be considerable. Concurrent with the development of regional shale gas, we have been increasing our purchases from the Marcellus/Utica shale gas regions and in 2018 they accounted for approximately 70% of the gas we procured. While these prices provide some perspective on past and future prices, the forward prices are volatile and there can be no assurance that such prices will remain in effect or that we will be able to contract output at these forward prices.
Fuel Supply

• | Nuclear Fuel Supply—We have long-term contracts for nuclear fuel. These contracts provide for:


• | purchase of uranium (concentrates and uranium hexafluoride),


• | conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride,


• | enrichment of uranium hexafluoride, and


• | fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies.

9


• | Coal Supply—The Keystone, Conemaugh and Bridgeport Harbor 3 (BH3) stations operate on coal. Coal is delivered to these units through a combination of rail, truck, barge and ocean shipments.

To control emissions levels, our BH3 unit uses a specific type of coal obtained from Indonesia. We have coal inventory at the BH3 station as well as off-site storage to meet the plant’s projected requirements. 

• | Gas Supply—Natural gas is the primary fuel for the bulk of our load following and peaking fleet. We purchase gas directly from natural gas producers and marketers. These supplies are transported to New Jersey by four interstate pipelines with which we have contracted. In addition, we have firm gas transportation contracted for this winter season to serve a portion of the gas requirements for our Bethlehem Energy Center (BEC) in New York and hold year-round firm gas transportation to serve the majority of the requirements of Keys in Maryland.

We have 1.3 billion cubic feet-per-day of firm transportation capacity and 0.9 billion cubic feet-per-day of firm storage delivery under contract to meet our obligations under the BGSS contract. This volume includes capacity from the Pennsylvania and Ohio shale gas regions where we purchase the majority of our natural gas. On an as-available basis, this firm transportation capacity may also be used to serve the gas supply needs of our New Jersey generation fleet. 
Power has contracted for approximately 125,000 dekatherms/day of delivery capability on the PennEast Pipeline from eastern Pennsylvania to New Jersey. This delivery capability will be used to supplement the BGSS contract when it becomes operational.

• | Oil—Oil is used as the primary fuel for one load following steam unit and four combustion turbine peaking units and can be used as an alternate fuel by several load following and peaking units that have a dual-fuel capability. Oil for operations is drawn from on-site storage and is generally purchased on the spot market and delivered by truck or barge.

We expect to be able to meet the fuel supply demands of our customers and our operations. However, the ability to maintain an adequate fuel supply could be affected by several factors not within our control, including changes in prices and demand, curtailments by suppliers, severe weather, environmental regulations, and other factors. For additional information and a discussion of risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7. MD&A—Executive Overview of 2018 and Future Outlook and Item 8. Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.
Markets and Market Pricing 
The vast majority of Power’s generation assets are located in three centralized, competitive electricity markets operated by ISO organizations all of which are subject to the regulatory oversight of FERC: 

• | PJM Regional Transmission Organization—PJM conducts the largest centrally dispatched energy market in North America. It serves over 65 million people, nearly 20% of the total United States population, and has a record peak demand of 165,492 MW. The PJM Interconnection coordinates the movement of electricity through all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. The majority of our generating stations operate in PJM.


• | New York—The New York ISO (NYISO) is the market coordinator for New York State and is responsible for managing the New York Power Pool and for administering its energy marketplace. This service area has a population of about 19 million and a record peak demand of 33,956 MW. Our BEC operates in New York.


• | New England—The ISO-New England (ISO-NE) is the market coordinator for the New England Power Pool and for administering its energy marketplace which covers Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. This service area has a population of about 15 million and a record peak demand of 28,130 MW. Our Bridgeport and New Haven stations operate in Connecticut.

The price of electricity varies by location in each of these markets. Depending on our production and our obligations, these price differentials may increase or decrease our profitability.
Commodity prices, such as electricity, gas, coal, oil and environmental products, as well as the availability of our diverse fleet of generation units to operate, also have a considerable effect on our profitability. Over the long-term, the higher the forward prices are, the more attractive an environment exists for us to contract for the sale of our anticipated output. However, higher prices also increase the cost of replacement power; thereby placing us at greater risk should our generating units fail to operate effectively or otherwise become unavailable.
Over the past several years, lower wholesale natural gas prices have resulted in lower electric energy prices. One of the reasons for the lower natural gas prices is greater supply from more recently-developed sources, such as shale gas, much of which is 
10

produced in states adjacent to New Jersey (e.g. Pennsylvania). This trend has reduced margin on forward sales as we re-contract our expected generation output.
In addition to energy sales, we earn revenue from capacity payments for our generating assets. These payments are compensation for committing our generating units to the ISO for dispatch at its discretion. Capacity payments reflect the value to the ISO of assurance that there will be sufficient generating capacity available at all times to meet system reliability and energy requirements. Currently, there is sufficient capacity in the markets in which we operate. However, in certain areas of these markets, there are transmission system transfer limitations which raise concerns about reliability and create a more acute need for capacity.
In PJM and ISO-NE, where we operate most of our generation, the market design for capacity payments provides for a structured, forward-looking, transparent capacity pricing mechanism. This is through the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) in PJM and the Forward Capacity Market (FCM) in ISO-NE. These mechanisms provide greater transparency regarding the value of capacity and provide a pricing signal to prospective investors in new generating facilities to encourage expansion of capacity to meet future market demands. For additional information regarding FERC actions related to the capacity market construct, see Regulatory Issues—Federal Regulation. 
The prices to be received by generating units in PJM for capacity have been set through RPM base residual and incremental auctions and depend upon the zone in which the generating unit is located. For each delivery year, the prices differ in the various areas of PJM, depending on the transfer limitations of the transmission system in each area. Keystone and Conemaugh in Pennsylvania receive lower capacity prices than the majority of our PJM generating units since there are fewer constraints in that region and our generating units in New Jersey usually receive higher pricing.
Our PJM generating units are located in several zones. The average capacity prices that Power expects to receive from the base and incremental auctions which have been completed are disclosed in Item 8. Note 3. Revenues. The price that must be paid by an entity serving load in the various zones is also set through these auctions. These prices can be higher or lower than the prices disclosed in Note 3. Revenues due to the import and export capability to and from lower-priced areas. 
We have obtained price certainty for our PJM capacity through May 2022 and New England capacity through May 2026 for BH5 and May 2022 for New Haven through the RPM and FCM pricing mechanisms, respectively.
Like PJM and ISO-NE, the NYISO provides capacity payments to its generating units, but unlike the other two markets, the New York market does not provide a forward price signal beyond a six-month auction period.
On a prospective basis, many factors may affect the capacity pricing, including but not limited to:

• | load and demand,


• | availability of generating capacity (including retirements, additions, derates and forced outage rates),


• | capacity imports from external regions,


• | transmission capability between zones,


• | available amounts of demand response resources,


• | pricing mechanisms, including potentially increasing the number of zones to create more pricing sensitivity to changes in supply and demand, as well as other potential changes that PJM and the other ISOs may propose over time, and 


• | legislative and/or regulatory actions impacting the capacity auction or that permit subsidized local electric power generation.

For additional information on the RPM and FCM markets, as well as on state subsidization through various mechanisms, see Regulatory Issues—Federal Regulation.
Hedging Strategy
To mitigate volatility in our results, we seek to contract in advance for a significant portion of our anticipated electric output, capacity and fuel needs. We seek to sell a portion of our anticipated lower-cost generation over a multi-year forward horizon, normally over a period of two to three years. We believe this hedging strategy increases the stability of earnings.
Among the ways in which we hedge our output are: (1) sales at PJM West or other nodes within PJM corresponding to our generation portfolio and (2) BGS and similar full-requirements contracts. Sales in PJM generally reflect block energy sales at the liquid PJM Western Hub or other basis locations when available and other transactions that seek to secure price certainty for our generation related products. The BGS-RSCP contract, a full-requirements contract that includes energy and capacity, ancillary and other services, is awarded for three-year periods through an auction process managed by the BPU. The volume of 
11

BGS contracts and the mix of electric utilities that our generation operations serve will vary from year to year. Pricing for the BGS contracts, including a capacity component, for recent and future periods by purchasing utility is as follows: 

Load Zone ($/MWh) | 2016-2019 | 2017-2020 | 2018-2021 | 2019-2022
PSE&G | $96.38 | $90.78 | $91.77 | $98.04 
Jersey Central Power & Light Company (JCP&L) | $74.85 | $69.08 | $73.11 | $77.15 
Atlantic City Electric Company | $82.14 | $75.49 | $81.23 | $87.40 
Rockland Electric Company | $85.02 | $80.50 | $85.94 | $88.03 

Although we enter into these hedges to provide price certainty for a large portion of our anticipated generation, there is variability in both our actual output as well as in the effectiveness of our hedges. Actual output will vary based upon total market demand, the relative cost position of our units compared to other units in the market and the operational flexibility of our units. Hedge volume can also vary, depending on the type of hedge into which we have entered. The BGS auction, for example, results in a contract that provides for the supplier to serve a percentage of the default load of a New Jersey EDC, that is, the load that remains after some customers have chosen to be served directly either by third-party suppliers or through municipal aggregation. The amount of power supplied through the BGS auction varies based on the level of the EDC’s default load, which is affected by the number of customers who are served by third-party suppliers, as well as by other factors such as weather and the economy.
In recent years, as market prices declined from previous levels, there was an incentive for more of the smaller C&I electric customers to switch to third-party suppliers. In a falling price environment, this has a negative impact on our margins, as the anticipated BGS pricing is replaced by lower spot market pricing. As average BGS rates have declined to a level that more closely resembles current market prices, customers may see less of an incentive to switch to third-party suppliers. We are unable to determine the degree to which this switching, or “migration,” will continue, but the impact on our results could be material should market prices fall or rise significantly.
Reflecting February 2019 BGS auction results, the contracted percentages of our anticipated base load generation output for the next three years with modest amounts beyond 2021 are as follows:
 
Base Load Generation | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 
Generation Sales | 100% | 95%-100% | 30%-35%

In a changing market environment, this hedging strategy may cause our realized prices to differ materially from current market prices. In a rising price environment, this strategy normally results in lower margins than would have been the case had no hedging activity been conducted. Alternatively, in a falling price environment, this hedging strategy will tend to create margins higher than those implied by the then-current market.
Our fuel strategy is to maintain certain levels of uranium in inventory and to make periodic purchases to support such levels. Our nuclear fuel commitments cover approximately 100% of our estimated uranium, enrichment and fabrication requirements through 2020 and a significant portion through 2021. 
We also have various long-term fuel purchase commitments for coal to support our Keystone and Conemaugh stations. These purchase obligations are consistent with our strategy, in general, to enter into contracts for our fuel supply in comparable volumes to our sales contracts.
We take a more opportunistic approach in hedging both the fuel for and the anticipated output of our natural gas-fired generation. The generation from more efficient load following units can be estimated with a moderate degree of certainty. The peaking units are less predictable, as a significant portion of these units will only dispatch when aggregate market demand has exceeded the supply provided by lower-cost units. The natural gas-fired units are hedged based on their expected generation; however, at much lower thresholds than baseload generation. Additionally, the recent development of low-cost gas supplies in the Marcellus region presents opportunities during certain portions of the year to procure gas for our generating units at attractive prices.
More than half of Power’s expected gross margin in 2019 relates to our hedging strategy, our expected revenues from the capacity market mechanisms described above and certain ancillary service payments such as reactive power.

Energy Holdings Lease Investments 
Energy Holdings primarily owns and manages a portfolio of domestic lease investments. The majority of Energy Holdings’ $540 million of domestic lease investments are primarily energy-related leveraged leases. As of December 31, 2018, the counterparties for 55% of our total leveraged lease investments were rated below investment grade by Standard & Poor’s (S&P). See Item 8. Note 9. Financing Receivables for additional information.
Energy Holdings’ leveraged leasing portfolio is designed to provide a fixed rate of return. Leveraged lease investments involve three parties: an owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. In a typical leveraged lease financing, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. The purchase price is typically financed 80% with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. The creditor provides long-term financing to the transaction secured by the property subject to the lease. Such long-term financing is non-recourse to the lessor and, with respect to our lease investments, is not presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The lessor acquires economic and tax ownership of the asset and then leases it to the lessee for a period of time no greater than 80% of its remaining useful life. As the owner, the lessor is entitled to depreciate the asset under applicable federal and state tax guidelines. The lessor receives income from lease payments made by the lessee during the term of the lease and from tax benefits associated with interest and depreciation deductions with respect to the leased property. Our ability to realize these tax benefits is dependent on operating gains generated by our other operating subsidiaries and allocated pursuant to the consolidated tax sharing agreement between us and our operating subsidiaries.
Lease rental payments are unconditional obligations of the lessee and are set at levels at least sufficient to service the non-recourse lease debt. The lessor is also entitled to any residual value associated with the leased asset at the end of the lease term. An evaluation of the after-tax cash flows to the lessor determines the return on the investment. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), the leveraged lease investment is recorded net of non-recourse debt and income is recognized as a constant return on the net unrecovered investment.
For additional information on leases, including the credit, tax and accounting risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Credit Risk, and Item 8. Note 9. Financing Receivables.
LIPA Operating Services Agreement (OSA)
In accordance with a twelve year Amended and Restated OSA entered into by PSEG LI and LIPA, PSEG LI commenced operating LIPA’s electric T&D system in Long Island, New York on January 1, 2014. As required by the OSA, PSEG LI also provides certain administrative support functions to LIPA. PSEG LI uses its brand in the Long Island T&D service area. Under the OSA, PSEG LI acts as LIPA’s agent in performing many of its obligations and in return (a) receives reimbursement for pass-through operating expenditures, (b) receives a fixed management fee and (c) is eligible to receive an incentive fee contingent on meeting established performance metrics. Also, there is an opportunity for the parties to extend the contract for an additional eight years subject to the achievement by PSEG LI of certain performance levels during the initial term of the OSA. Further, since January 2015, Power provides fuel procurement and power management services to LIPA under separate agreements. 
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT
PSE&G
Our T&D business is minimally impacted when customers choose alternate electric or gas suppliers since we earn our return by providing transmission and distribution service, not by supplying the commodity. Increased reliance by customers on net-metered generation, including solar, and changes in customer behaviors can result in decreased reliance on our system and impact our revenues and investment opportunities. The demand for electric energy and gas by customers is affected by customer conservation, economic conditions, weather and other factors not within our control. Construction of new local generation and changing customer usage patterns also have the potential to reduce the need for the construction of new transmission to transport remote generation and alleviate system constraints.
Changes in the current policies for building new transmission lines, such as those ordered by FERC and being implemented by PJM and other ISOs to eliminate contractual provisions that previously provided us a “right of first refusal” to construct projects in our service territory, could result in third-party construction of transmission lines in our area in the future and also allow us to seek opportunities to build in other service territories. These rules continue to evolve so both the extent of the risk within our service territory and the opportunities for our transmission business elsewhere remain difficult to assess. For additional information, see the discussion in Regulatory Issues—Federal Regulation—Transmission Regulation, below.

Power
Various market participants compete with us and one another in transacting in the wholesale energy markets, entering into bilateral contracts and selling to individual and aggregated retail customers. Our competitors include:

• | merchant generators,


• | domestic and multi-national utility generators,


• | energy marketers and retailers,


• | private equity firms, banks and other financial entities,


• | fuel supply companies, and


• | affiliates of other industrial companies.

New additions of lower-cost or more efficient generation capacity could make our plants less economic in the future. Although it is not clear if this capacity will be built or, if so, what the economic impact will be, such additions would impact market prices and our competitiveness.
Our business is also under competitive pressure due to demand-side management (DSM) and other efficiency efforts aimed at changing the quantity and patterns of usage by consumers which could result in a reduction in load requirements. A reduction in load requirements can also be caused by economic cycles, weather, municipal aggregation and other customer migration and other factors. In addition, how resources such as demand response and capacity imports are permitted to bid into the capacity markets also affects the prices paid to generators such as Power in these markets. It is also possible that advances in technology, such as distributed generation and micro grids, will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity to a level that is competitive with that of most central station electric production. To the extent that additions to the electric transmission system relieve or reduce limitations and constraints in eastern PJM where most of our plants are located, our revenues could be adversely affected. Changes in the rules governing what types of transmission will be built, who is selected to build transmission and who will pay the costs of future transmission could also impact our generation revenues.
Adverse changes in energy industry law, policies and regulation could have significant economic, environmental and reliability consequences. For example, PJM, NYISO and ISO-NE each have capacity markets that have been approved by FERC. FERC regulates these markets and continues to examine whether the market design for each of these three capacity markets is working optimally. Various forums are considering how the competitive market framework can incorporate or be reconciled with state public policies that support particular resources, resource attributes or emerging technologies, whether generators are being sufficiently compensated in the capacity market and whether subsidized resources may be adversely affecting capacity market prices. We cannot predict what action, if any, FERC might take with regard to capacity market designs but it may have an impact on Power’s generation portfolio. For additional information, see the discussion in Regulatory Issues—Federal Regulation.
Environmental issues, such as restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants, may also have a competitive impact on us to the extent that it becomes more expensive for some of our plants to remain compliant, thus affecting our ability to be a lower-cost provider compared to competitors without such restrictions. In addition, most of our plants, which are located in the Northeast where rules are more stringent, can be at an economic disadvantage compared to our competitors in certain Midwest states. 
While it is our expectation that continued efforts may be undertaken by the federal and state governments to preserve the existing base nuclear generating plants, we still believe that pressures from renewable resources will continue to increase. 
EMPLOYEE RELATIONS
As of December 31, 2018, we had 13,145 employees within our subsidiaries, including 8,145 covered under collective bargaining agreements with eight unions expiring from 2019 through 2022. We believe we maintain satisfactory relationships with our employees.

Employees as of December 31, 2018

REGULATORY ISSUES 
In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to regulation by, and are party to various claims and regulatory proceedings with, FERC, the BPU, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and various state and federal environmental regulators, among others. For information regarding material matters, other than those discussed below, see Item 8. Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.
Federal Regulation
FERC
FERC is an independent federal agency that regulates the transmission of electric energy and gas in interstate commerce and the sale of electric energy and gas at wholesale pursuant to the FPA and the Natural Gas Act. PSE&G and the generation and energy trading subsidiaries of Power are public utilities as defined by the FPA. FERC has extensive oversight over such public utilities. FERC approval is usually required when a public utility seeks to: sell or acquire an asset that is regulated by FERC (such as a transmission line or a generating station); collect costs from customers associated with a new transmission facility; charge a rate for wholesale sales under a contract or tariff; or engage in certain mergers and internal corporate reorganizations. 
FERC also regulates generating facilities known as qualifying facilities (QFs). QFs are cogeneration facilities that produce electricity and another form of useful thermal energy, or small power production facilities where the primary energy source is renewable, biomass, waste or geothermal resources. QFs must meet certain criteria established by FERC. We own various QFs through Power. QFs are subject to some, but not all, of the same FERC requirements as public utilities.
FERC also regulates Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs)/ISOs, such as PJM, and their energy and capacity markets.
For us, the major effects of FERC regulation fall into five general categories:

• | Regulation of Wholesale Sales—Generation/Market Issues/Market Power


• | Energy Clearing Prices


• | Capacity Market Issues


• | Transmission Regulation


• | Compliance

Regulation of Wholesale Sales—Generation/Market Issues/Market Power
Under FERC regulations, public utilities that wish to sell power at market rates must receive FERC authorization (MBR Authority) to sell power in interstate commerce before making power sales. They can sell power at cost-based rates or apply to FERC for authority to make market-based rate (MBR) sales. For a requesting company to receive MBR Authority, FERC must first determine that the requesting company lacks market power in the relevant markets and/or that market power in the relevant markets is sufficiently mitigated. The following PSEG companies are public utilities and currently have MBR Authority: PSE&G, PSEG Energy Resources & Trade (ER&T), PSEG Fossil, PSEG Nuclear, PSEG Power Connecticut, PSEG New Haven, PSEG Energy Solutions, PSEG Keys Energy Center LLC, Pavant Solar II LLC, San Isabel Solar LLC and Bison Solar LLC. FERC requires that holders of MBR Authority file an update every three years demonstrating that they continue to lack market power and/or that their market power has been sufficiently mitigated and report in the interim to FERC any material change in facts from those FERC relied on in granting MBR Authority.  
Energy Clearing Prices
Energy clearing prices in the markets in which we operate are generally based on bids submitted by generating units. Under FERC-approved market rules, bids are subject to price caps and mitigation rules applicable to certain generation units. FERC rules also govern the overall design of these markets. At present, all units within a delivery zone receive a clearing price based on the bid of the marginal unit (i.e. the last unit that must be dispatched to serve the needs of load) which can vary by location. In addition, recent rule changes in the energy markets administered by PJM and ISO-NE (see Capacity Market Issues below) impose rigorous performance obligations and nonperformance penalties on resources during times of system stress. These FERC rules provide an opportunity for bonus payments or require the payment of penalties depending on whether a unit is available during a performance hour.
FERC has also ordered certain favorable changes to energy market price formation rules improving shortage pricing and enhancing bidding flexibility for units. We continue to advocate in this context for additional changes in market rules that would provide more transparency regarding operator actions affecting energy market prices and would promote better alignment between generation dispatch decisions and energy market price outcomes. Certain reforms, such as a reform that 
15

would allow prices to better reflect scarcity conditions in which short-term demand is met by fast-start resources, are currently pending before FERC. However, we cannot predict whether they will be adopted. 
In February 2019, the PJM Board approved a filing to modify the curves used for pricing reserves with FERC. The reforms include a 30-minute reserve product in real-time, more dynamic reserve requirements to better capture operator actions taken to maintain reliability, and improvement to the curves used to price reserves during reserve shortage conditions. If placed into effect, this reform is expected to improve energy and reserve prices by ensuring that when operators commit resources to ensure reliability, the commitments are reflected in market clearing prices. However, this reform could result in lower capacity payments. There is no timeline for this type of filing and therefore we cannot predict when FERC will act on the filing or the outcome of this matter.
Capacity Market Issues
PJM, NYISO and ISO-NE each have capacity markets that have been approved by FERC. FERC regulates these markets and continues to examine whether the market design for each of these three capacity markets is working optimally. Various forums are considering how the competitive market framework can incorporate or be reconciled with state public policies that support particular resources, resource attributes or emerging technologies, whether generators are being sufficiently compensated in the capacity market and whether subsidized resources may be adversely affecting capacity market prices. We cannot predict what action, if any, FERC might take with regard to capacity market designs.
PJM—The RPM is the locational installed capacity market design for the PJM region, including a forward auction for installed capacity. Under the RPM, generators located in constrained areas within PJM are paid more for their capacity as an incentive to ensure adequate supply where generation capacity is most needed. The mechanics of the RPM in PJM continue to evolve and be refined in stakeholder proceedings and FERC proceedings in which we are active.
In June 2018, FERC issued an order finding that PJM’s current capacity market construct was not just and reasonable. FERC found that the RPM market design was not sufficiently competitive because it enabled state-supported resources to bid below their costs which resulted in suppressed clearing prices. In particular, FERC found that nuclear generating units that receive zero emission certificate (ZEC) payments were of concern. FERC initiated a separate proceeding to develop a mechanism to protect resources that do not receive subsidies and proposed a Fixed Resource Alternative option that removes subsidized resources along with a commensurate amount of load. PSEG and other parties have sought rehearing of FERC’s order, which is still pending. 
In response to FERC’s order, PJM proposed a minimum offer price rule (MOPR) with a significant number of exceptions and a “resource carve-out” (RCO) option that would carve certain resources out of the capacity market that have actionable subsidies. If this proposal is ultimately adopted by FERC and our New Jersey nuclear units receive ZECs, they may become subject to the MOPR and would be required to submit capacity bids at a level that may be above the auction clearing price. Under this scenario, if Hope Creek, Salem 1 and Salem 2 nuclear units are awarded ZECs, they may not clear the capacity auction in whole or in part, and they may not receive capacity payments. However, these units may be eligible for the RCO option and receive payments directly from New Jersey Load-serving entities through a mechanism approved by the BPU. The BPU could utilize the existing BGS mechanism for this purpose.
PJM also proposed an alternative to the RCO option that includes a two-tiered “repricing” option. Under this proposal, PJM would run an initial auction to determine which resources would receive a commitment and a second auction to determine the price to pay the capacity resources. If this mechanism was adopted by FERC, it would likely have a favorable impact on the capacity payments received by non-nuclear units within the PSEG generating fleet but could adversely affect the nuclear units if, as ZEC recipients, they participate as RCO resources and have to make payments to other plants. We are unable to predict the outcome of the FERC proceeding or any BPU efforts to effectuate the RCO option.
In October 2018, PJM filed with FERC to revise the shape of the Variable Resource Requirement (VRR) curve that will be implemented for the capacity auction that will be held in August 2019. The VRR curve is the administratively determined demand curve that serves as one of the key elements for establishing the amount of generation capacity to be procured in the auction. PJM contends that its proposal will lower capacity prices as compared to the currently effective VRR curve. PSEG protested PJM’s proposal on the grounds that it would result in understated prices for capacity relative to the cost of constructing a new reference generating unit and will result in prices that are unjust and unreasonable. This matter is pending before FERC and we cannot predict the outcome. 
ISO-NE—ISO-NE’s market for installed capacity in New England provides fixed capacity payments for generators, imports and demand response. The market design consists of a forward-looking auction for installed capacity that is intended to recognize the locational value of resources on the system and contains incentive mechanisms to encourage availability during stressed system conditions. ISO-NE also employs a mechanism, similar to PJM’s Capacity Performance mechanism, that provides incentives for performance and that imposes charges for non-performance during times of system stress. We view this mechanism as generally positive for generating resources as providing more robust income streams. However, it also imposes additional financial risk for non-performance. In March 2018, FERC approved proposed changes to the FCM referred to as the 
16

Competitive Auctions and Sponsored Policy Resources (CASPR) to accommodate clean and renewable energy policy resources. The CASPR design creates a second auction that commences immediately following the Forward Capacity Auction and provides the opportunity for certain renewable, clean and alternative energy resources to acquire supply obligations when they cannot clear economically in the Forward Capacity Auction. The CASPR design also phases out the exemption from the MOPR in the capacity market afforded for up to 200MW annually (600 MW cumulatively) of renewable resources, an aspect of the market design that we did not support due to the capacity market suppression associated with this mechanism. The effective date of these CASPR provisions will be implemented beginning with the Forward Capacity Auction to be held in February 2019. 
NYISO—NYISO operates a short-term capacity market that provides a forward price signal only for six months into the future. Various matters pending before FERC could affect the competitiveness of this market and the outcome of these proceedings could result in artificial price suppression unless sufficient market protections are adopted. 
One capacity market matter pending before FERC involves rules to govern payments and bidding requirements for generators proposing to exit the market but required to remain in service for reliability reasons. In March 2015, FERC issued an order which held that units receiving special reliability payments could properly take those payments into account in formulating capacity market bids. We believe that this ruling could impact efficient price formation in the capacity market and could artificially suppress capacity market outcomes. In April 2015, a trade association, Independent Power Producers of New York, Inc. (IPPNY) of which Power is a member, filed for rehearing by FERC of this ruling, which was denied by FERC at the end of 2017. In connection with this same proceeding, FERC required NYISO to submit a report addressing whether buyer-side mitigation measures are needed for new entry occurring in the “Rest of State” region and for uneconomic retention and repowering anywhere in the state. NYISO filed a report with FERC in December 2015 contending that these measures are not needed. The IPPNY has opposed NYISO’s contentions. The matter remains pending before FERC. In addition, in May 2015, the New York Public Service Commission and other New York agencies filed a complaint at FERC requesting certain exemptions from the NYISO rules that prevent capacity suppliers from submitting bids that are not market competitive. In October 2015, FERC granted in part, certain of the requested exemptions for renewable resources and resources being used by the owner for self-supply. The IPPNY has challenged NYISO’s proposed implementation of the newly required exemptions. This challenge is still pending.
Transmission Regulation
FERC has exclusive jurisdiction to establish the rates and terms and conditions of service for interstate transmission. We currently have FERC-approved formula rates in effect to recover the costs of our transmission facilities. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in January of each year based upon our internal forecast of annual expenses and capital expenditures. Rates are subsequently trued up to reflect actual annual expenses and capital expenditures.
For additional information about our transmission filings, see Item 8. Note 7. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.
Transmission Policy Developments—There are several matters pending before FERC that concern the allocation of costs associated with transmission projects contending that insufficient levels of costs are being allocated to customers in the PSE&G transmission zone. Projects involved include the Artificial Island project and the Bergen-Linden Corridor project in New Jersey. In April 2016, FERC issued orders denying the complaints and leaving the current cost allocation in effect as to the Bergen-Linden project. In October 2017, FERC accepted the Artificial Island Cost allocation filing on the grounds that PJM correctly applied its Tariff. However, FERC deferred a ruling on whether the cost allocation methodology applied to the Artificial Island project is appropriate. FERC will decide this issue in a separate proceeding that is currently pending. It is anticipated that additional proceedings are likely to occur. 
Another proceeding is a matter remanded from a federal appellate court concerning the appropriate cost allocation for certain 500 kilovolt (kV) projects in PJM that either have been built or are in the process of being built. In May 2018, FERC approved a settlement for this matter that is expected to result in increased annual cost allocations to customers in the PSE&G transmission zone. The cost reallocation was implemented by PJM in July 2018. Under this settlement, Power, as a BGS supplier is obligated to pay amounts previously paid by other PJM transmission customers. In November 2018, the BPU authorized BGS suppliers to collect increased allocation amounts from BGS customers through a pass-through provision in the BGS supplier contracts. 
Transmission Rate Proceedings and Return on Equity—Numerous complaints have been filed at FERC in recent years seeking to reduce the base ROE of transmission owners across the country. Many of those complaints were resolved through agreement and settlement resulted in ROE reductions while others remain pending in the FERC adjudication process or are being litigated in the courts. Recent court decisions, as well as proposed changes to the ROE calculation methodology discussed below, create some uncertainty as to the timing and outcome of these complaints. The results of these settlements and proceedings could set precedents for other transmission owners with formula rates in place, including PSE&G.
In October 2018, FERC issued an order establishing a new framework for determining whether a company’s ROE is unjust and unreasonable. The order was issued in a proceeding that was remanded to FERC from D.C. Circuit concerning the 
17

establishment of the New England Transmission Owners’ ROE. FERC’s order proposes a new method for evaluating whether an existing ROE remains just and reasonable. Under FERC’s approach, FERC will determine a composite zone of reasonableness based on the results of three financial models, and if the targeted utility’s existing ROE falls within the range of just and reasonable ROEs for its risk profile, FERC will dismiss the complaint. However, if FERC determines that an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable, it proposes to rely on four financial models: a discounted cash flow, a risk premium analysis, a capital-asset pricing model analysis and an expected earnings analysis. We are analyzing the potential impact of these methodologies and cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.
Compliance
Reliability Standards—Congress has required FERC to put in place, through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), national and regional reliability standards to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system (grid) and to prevent major system blackouts. As a result, FERC directed NERC to draft a physical security standard intended to further protect assets deemed “critical” to reliability of the grid. In November 2014, FERC issued an order approving NERC’s proposed physical security standard. Under the standard, utilities will be required to identify critical substations as well as develop threat assessment plans to be reviewed by independent third parties. In our case, the third-party is PJM. As part of these plans, utilities could decide or be required to build additional redundancy into their systems. This standard will supplement the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards that are already in place and that establish physical and cybersecurity protections for critical systems. We are taking steps to meet these obligations. FERC directed NERC to develop a new reliability standard to provide security controls for supply chain management associated with the procurement of industrial control system hardware, software, and services related to bulk electric system operations. When adopted, compliance with these new standards would be expected to impose additional obligations and costs.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the SEC and the CFTC are in the process of implementing a new regulatory framework for swaps and security-based swaps. The legislation was enacted to reduce systemic risk, increase transparency and promote market integrity within the financial system by providing for the registration and comprehensive regulation of swap dealers and by imposing recordkeeping, data reporting, margin and clearing requirements with respect to swaps. To implement the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has engaged in a comprehensive rulemaking process and has issued a number of proposed and final rules addressing many of the key issues. We are currently subject to recordkeeping and data reporting requirements applicable to commercial end users. The CFTC has also re-proposed rules establishing position limits for trading in certain commodities, such as natural gas, and we will begin complying with these rules once they become final. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) 
Our operation of nuclear generating facilities is subject to comprehensive regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), a federal agency established to regulate nuclear activities to ensure the protection of public health and safety, as well as the security and protection of the environment. Such regulation involves testing, evaluation and modification of all aspects of plant operation in light of NRC safety and environmental requirements. Continuous demonstration to the NRC that plant operations meet requirements is also necessary. 
The NRC has the ultimate authority to determine whether any nuclear generating unit may operate. The NRC conducts ongoing reviews of nuclear industry operating experience and may issue or revise regulatory requirements as a result of these ongoing reviews. We are unable to predict the final outcome of these reviews or the cost of any actions we would need to take to comply with any new regulations, including possible modifications to the Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom facilities, but such costs could be material.
State Regulation
Since our operations are primarily located within New Jersey, our principal state regulator is the BPU, which oversees electric and natural gas distribution companies in New Jersey. We are also subject to various other states’ regulations due to our operations in those states. 
Our New Jersey utility operations are subject to comprehensive regulation by the BPU including, among other matters, regulation of retail electric and gas distribution rates and service, the issuance and sale of certain types of securities and compliance matters. PSE&G’s participation in solar, demand response and energy efficiency programs is also regulated by the BPU, as the terms and conditions of these programs are approved by the BPU. BPU regulation can also have a direct or indirect impact on our power generation business as it relates to energy supply agreements and energy policy in New Jersey.
In addition to base rates, we recover certain costs or earn on certain investments pursuant to mechanisms known as adjustment clauses. These clauses permit the flow-through of costs to, or the recovery of investments from, customers related to specific programs, outside the context of base rate proceedings. Recovery of these costs or investments is subject to BPU approval for 
18

which we make periodic filings. Delays in the pass-through of costs or recovery of investments under these mechanisms could result in significant changes in cash flow. For additional information on our specific filings, see Item 8. Note 7. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. 
New Jersey Energy Master Plan (EMP)—In May 2018, the New Jersey governor signed an executive order directing the BPU and other New Jersey executive branch agencies to prepare a new EMP by June 1, 2019. While not having the force of law, the EMP provides an overview of energy policy in New Jersey. The new EMP will, among other issues: focus on New Jersey converting to 100% clean energy sources by January 1, 2050; incorporate New Jersey’s offshore wind development goals; include provisions to guide the continued development of solar energy, including community solar; make recommendations to bolster energy storage in New Jersey; and explore methods to incentivize the use of clean, efficient energy and electric technology alternatives in New Jersey’s transportation sector and at its ports.
In January 2018, the governor of New Jersey signed Executive Order No. 8 directing the BPU to begin the process of moving the state toward its 2030 goal of 3,500 MW of offshore wind energy generation. An initial solicitation was established for 1,100 MW of offshore wind, with bids due in December 2018. For a discussion of our involvement with offshore wind in New Jersey, see Item 7. MD&A—Executive Overview of 2018 and Future Outlook.
Energy Efficiency Initiatives—In May 2018, the New Jersey governor signed legislation that requires the state’s electric and gas utilities to implement energy efficiency programs that are expected to achieve energy savings targets for electric and gas usage within five years of the utility’s implementation of its BPU-approved energy efficiency programs. To meet these savings targets, energy usage reductions and peak demand reductions that result from utility and non-utility based programs and investments (including building code changes) will be counted. The initial targets are 2% of annual electric usage and 0.75% of annual gas usage with the targets then being reassessed periodically by the BPU. The specific energy savings target for each public electric and gas utility will be determined from an energy efficiency study to be completed within a year from enactment of the legislation. The legislation requires utilities to make annual filings with the BPU outlining their planned investments and proposed programs for cost-effectively achieving the targeted energy savings. These filings are also expected to address the utility’s return of and on those investments and recovery of lost revenues associated with the lower sales. The BPU is required to adopt rules to implement the legislation within one year of enactment.
Infrastructure Investment Program (IIP)—The BPU has enacted IIP regulations that encourage utilities to construct, install or remediate utility plant and facilities related to reliability, resiliency and/or safety to support the provision of safe and adequate service. Under these regulations, utilities can seek authority to make specified infrastructure investments in programs extending for up to five years with accelerated cost recovery mechanisms. The BPU characterized the IIP regulations as a regulatory initiative intended to create a financial incentive for utilities to accelerate the level of investment needed to promote the timely rehabilitation and replacement of certain non-revenue producing infrastructure that enhances reliability, resiliency, and/or safety. 
BGSS Process—In November 2017, a filing was made by the Retail Energy Supply Association (RESA) with the BPU requesting that the BPU revisit the BGSS process and establish a gas capacity release program. In March 2018, the RESA filed an amended petition with the BPU requesting a formal proceeding to establish a gas capacity release program. This filing applies to all New Jersey gas utilities. The matter remains pending.
BPU 2018 Storm Investigation—The BPU conducted an investigation of the state’s EDCs’ responses to the March 2018 late winter storms. Based on the findings of the investigation, the BPU implemented certain recommendations that it deemed essential to facilitate the continued provision of safe, proper and adequate service; to help mitigate future outages; and to help develop more effective responses and coordination of resources. These recommendations imposed several specific follow-up requirements on the EDCs concerning, among other things, weather forecasting; updates to the EDCs’ event level classification matrices and emergency operations plans; and submission of a plan and cost benefit analysis for the implementation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI).  
In January 2019, PSE&G filed a response to the request for a plan and cost benefit analysis for the implementation of AMI.  The response highlighted a number of customer and operational benefits associated with the deployment of AMI, and incorporated PSE&G’s EC Business case and direct testimony from the CEF-EC proceeding previously filed with the BPU. PSE&G has filed all responses to the follow-up requirements specified by the BPU.  
Federal Tax Legislation —As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act), various state regulatory authorities, including the BPU, took action to ensure that excess federal income taxes previously collected in rates are returned to customers. We have adjusted our revenue requirement in certain of our rate matters as a result of the change in the federal income tax rate. 
Additional matters and information on our specific filings are discussed in Item 8. Note 7. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.

Cybersecurity
In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cybersecurity incidents, we have established a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our company’s and our customers’ information and our systems. Our cybersecurity program is built on technical, procedural, and people-focused measures to detect, protect against, respond to, and recover from cyber threats to our systems and information including company, employee and customer data. Features of our program include: identifying critical information and systems; conducting cyber risk assessments of our and third-party systems; maintaining awareness of cyber threats and vulnerabilities through partnerships with public and private entities, as well as industry groups; maintaining and testing our cybersecurity incident response plans and systems; training personnel on cybersecurity issues; cybersecurity awareness throughout our company with electronic notices and seminars; and periodically reviewing industry best practices and operational benchmarking. Cybersecurity and the effectiveness of our cybersecurity processes are discussed by senior management and at Board and Audit Committee meetings. Our strategy for managing cyber-related risks is integrated within our enterprise risk management processes. 
In addition, we are subject to federal and state requirements designed to further protect against cybersecurity threats to critical infrastructure, as discussed below. For a discussion of the risks associated with cybersecurity threats, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Federal—NERC, at the direction of FERC, has implemented national and regional reliability standards to ensure the reliability of the grid and to prevent major system blackouts. NERC CIP standards establish cybersecurity and physical security protections for critical systems and facilities. These standards are also designed to develop coordination, threat sharing and interaction between utilities and various government agencies regarding potential cybersecurity and physical threats against the nation’s electric grid. 
FERC further directed NERC to develop a new reliability standard to provide security controls for supply chain management associated with the procurement of industrial control system hardware, software, and services related to bulk electric system operations. FERC approved these supply chain risk management standards in October 2018, with an implementation date of July 1, 2020. We are taking steps to meet these additional obligations. Compliance with these new standards would be expected to impose additional costs. 
State—The BPU requires utilities, including PSE&G, to, among other things, implement a cybersecurity program that defines and implements organization accountabilities and responsibilities for cyber risk management activities, and establishes policies, plans, processes and procedures for identifying and mitigating cyber risk to critical systems. Additional requirements of this order include, but are not limited to: (i) annually inventorying critical utility systems; (ii) annually assessing risks to critical utility systems; (iii) implementing controls to mitigate cyber risks to critical utility systems; (iv) monitoring log files of critical utility systems; (v) reporting cyber incidents to the BPU; and (vi) establishing a cybersecurity incident response plan and conducting biennial exercises to test the plan.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations with regard to environmental matters including, but not limited to:

• | air pollution control,


• | climate change,


• | water pollution control,


• | hazardous substance liability, and


• | fuel and waste disposal.

We expect there will be changes to existing environmental laws and regulations that could significantly impact the manner in which our operations are currently conducted. Such laws and regulations may also affect the timing, cost, location, design, construction and operation of new facilities. Due to evolving environmental regulations, it is difficult to project future costs of compliance and their impact on competition. Capital costs of complying with known pollution control requirements are included in our estimate of construction expenditures in Item 7. MD&A—Capital Requirements. The costs of compliance associated with any new requirements that may be imposed by future regulations are not known, but may be material.
For additional information related to environmental matters, including proceedings not discussed below, as well as anticipated expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, hazardous substance liabilities and fuel and waste disposal costs, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

Air Pollution Control
Our facilities are subject to federal regulation under the Clean Air Act (CAA) that requires controls of emissions from sources of air pollution and imposes recordkeeping, reporting and permit requirements. Our facilities are also subject to requirements established under state and local air pollution laws. The CAA requires all major sources, such as our generation facilities, to obtain and keep current an operating permit. The costs of compliance associated with any new requirements that may be imposed and included in these permits in the future could be material and are not included in our estimates of capital expenditures.
Hazardous Air Pollutants Regulation—In February 2012, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published Mercury Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for both newly-built and existing electric generating sources under the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) provisions of the CAA. The MATS established allowable levels for mercury as well as other hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) and went into effect in April 2015. In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held that it was unreasonable for the EPA to refuse to consider the materiality of costs in determining whether to regulate hazardous air pollutants from power plants. In April 2016, the EPA released the final Supplemental Finding that considers the materiality of costs in determining whether to regulate hazardous air pollutants from power plants in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling. The 2016 Supplemental Finding determined that HAPS from existing electric generating units should be regulated and that the environmental and health benefits derived from the reduction in emissions of both HAPS and co-benefit pollutants far outweighed the cost of compliance. Industry participants and various state authorities filed petitions with the D.C. Circuit challenging the EPA’s Supplemental Finding. The D.C. Circuit is holding the case in abeyance pending further directions from the EPA. 
In December 2018, the EPA issued a proposed Supplemental Finding to reverse the 2016 Supplemental Finding, concluding that the analysis should not include the benefits from the reduction in emissions from co-benefit pollutants. Although the EPA proposed that it will retain the emission standards and other requirements of MATS, it is seeking comment on two alternatives to potentially rescind MATS. Finally, the EPA proposal concluded that no additional regulations are required. We do not expect this Supplemental Finding, if finalized as proposed, to impact the operation of our facilities.
Climate Change
CO2 Regulation under the CAA—In October 2015, the EPA published the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new power plants. The NSPS establishes two emission standards for CO2 for the following categories: (i) fossil fuel-fired utility boilers and integrated gasification combined cycle units, and (ii) natural gas combustion turbines. Simple cycle combustion turbines are exempt from the rule.
In October 2015, the EPA also published the Clean Power Plan (CPP), a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulation under the CAA for existing power plants. 
In August 2018, the EPA released the proposed Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule as a replacement for the CPP. The proposed ACE rule gives states great flexibility to evaluate specific heat rate improvement technologies and practices to be applied at coal-fired electric generating units. States have three years from the date of finalization to submit a plan that establishes a standard of performance that reflects the degree of emission limitation through the application of heat rate improvement technologies and practices. We cannot estimate the impact of this action on our business or results of operations.
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)—In response to concerns over global climate change, some states have developed initiatives to stimulate national climate legislation through CO2 emission reductions in the electric power industry. Certain northeastern states (RGGI States), including New York and Connecticut where we have generation facilities, have state-specific rules in place to enable the RGGI regulatory mandate in each state to cap and reduce CO2 emissions. These rules make allowances available through a regional auction whereby generators may acquire allowances that are each equal to one ton of CO2 emissions. Generators are required to submit an allowance for each ton emitted over a three-year period. Allowances are available through the auction or secondary markets. 
In September 2017, the RGGI States announced their new post-2020 program for a cap on regional CO2 emissions, which would require a decline in CO2 emissions in 2021 and each year thereafter, resulting in a 30% reduction in the CO2 emissions cap by 2030.
New Jersey adopted the Global Warming Response Act in 2007, which calls for stabilizing its GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, followed by a further reduction of greenhouse emissions to 80% below 2006 levels by 2050. To reach this goal, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), the BPU, other state agencies and stakeholders are required to evaluate methods to meet and exceed the emission reduction targets, taking into account their economic benefits and costs. In December 2018, the NJDEP proposed two rules that begin New Jersey’s re-entry into RGGI. The first proposal is the mechanism that establishes New Jersey’s initial cap on GHG emissions of 18 million tons in 2020. The proposal follows the RGGI model rule with a cap that will decline three percent annually through 2030 to a final cap of 11.5 million tons. New Jersey is committed to a start date of January 1, 2020. The second proposal establishes the framework for how New Jersey will 
21

spend the RGGI auction proceeds. We cannot estimate the impact of this action on our business or results of operations at this time. 
Water Pollution Control
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) prohibits the discharge of pollutants to U.S. waters from point sources, except pursuant to a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by the EPA or by a state under a federally authorized state program. The FWPCA authorizes the imposition of technology-based and water quality-based effluent limits to regulate the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and ground waters. The EPA has delegated authority to a number of state agencies, including those in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, to administer the NPDES program through state action. We also have ownership interests in facilities in other jurisdictions that have their own laws and implement regulations to control discharges to their surface waters and ground waters that directly govern our facilities in those jurisdictions.
Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines—In September 2015, the EPA issued a new Effluent Limitation Guidelines Rule (ELG Rule) for steam electric generating units. The rule establishes new best available technology economically achievable (BAT) standards for fly ash transport water, bottom ash transport water, flue gas desulfurization and flue gas mercury control wastewater, and gasification wastewater. Power’s Bridgeport Harbor station and the jointly-owned Keystone and Conemaugh stations have bottom ash transport water discharges that are regulated under the ELG Rule. Keystone and Conemaugh also have flue gas desulfurization wastewaters regulated by the ELG Rule.
Through various orders, the EPA has stayed the compliance dates in the ELG Rule and has announced plans to further revise the requirements and compliance dates of the ELG Rule. Power is unable to determine how this will ultimately impact its compliance requirements or its financial condition and results of operations.
Cooling Water Intake Structure Regulation—In May 2014, the EPA issued a final cooling water intake rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) that establishes requirements for the regulation of cooling water intakes at existing power plants and industrial facilities with a design flow of more than two million gallons of water per day.  
The EPA has structured the rule so that each state Permitting Director will continue to consider renewal permits for existing power facilities on a case by case basis, based on studies related to impingement mortality and entrainment and submit the results with their permit applications to be conducted by the facilities seeking renewal permits. 
Several environmental organizations and certain energy industry groups have filed suit under the CWA and the Endangered Species Act. The cases have been consolidated at the Second Circuit and a decision remains pending.
We are assessing the potential impact of the rule on each of our affected facilities and are unable to predict the outcome of permitting decisions and the effect, if any, that they may have on our future capital requirements, financial condition or results of operations, although such impacts could be material. See Item 8. Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for additional information. 
Hazardous Substance Liability
The production and delivery of electricity and the distribution and manufacture of gas result in various by-products and substances classified by federal and state regulations as hazardous. These regulations may impose liability for damages to the environment from hazardous substances, including obligations to conduct environmental remediation of discharged hazardous substances as well as monetary payments, regardless of the absence of fault and the absence of any prohibitions against the activity when it occurred, as compensation for injuries to natural resources. Our historic operations and the operations of hundreds of other companies along the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers are alleged by federal and state agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the Passaic River/Newark Bay Complex. The EPA is also evaluating the Hackensack River, a tributary to Newark Bay, for inclusion in the Superfund program. We no longer manufacture gas. For additional information, see Item 8. Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.
Site Remediation—The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act (Spill Act) require the remediation of discharged hazardous substances and authorize the EPA, the NJDEP and private parties to commence lawsuits to compel clean-ups or reimbursement for such remediation. The clean-ups can be more complicated and costly when the hazardous substances are in a body of water.
Natural Resource Damages—CERCLA and the Spill Act authorize the assessment of damages against persons who have discharged a hazardous substance, causing an injury to natural resources. Pursuant to the Spill Act, the NJDEP requires persons conducting remediation to address injuries to natural resources through restoration or damages. The NJDEP adopted regulations concerning site investigation and remediation that require an ecological evaluation of potential damages to natural resources in connection with an environmental investigation of contaminated sites. 
22

Fuel and Waste Disposal
Nuclear Fuel Disposal—The federal government has entered into contracts with the operators of nuclear power plants for transportation and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), nuclear plant owners are required to contribute to a Nuclear Waste Fund to pay for this service. Since May 2014, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) reduced the nuclear waste fee to zero. No assurances can be given that this fee will not be increased in the future. The NWPA allows spent nuclear fuel generated in any reactor to be stored in reactor facility storage pools or in Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations located at reactors or away from reactor sites. 
We have on-site storage facilities that are expected to satisfy the storage needs of Salem 1, Salem 2, Hope Creek, Peach Bottom 2 and Peach Bottom 3 through the end of their operating licenses. 
Low-Level Radioactive Waste—As a by-product of their operations, nuclear generation units produce low-level radioactive waste. Such waste includes paper, plastics, protective clothing, water purification materials and other materials. These waste materials are accumulated on site and disposed of at licensed permanent disposal facilities. New Jersey, Connecticut and South Carolina have formed the Atlantic Compact, which gives New Jersey nuclear generators continued access to the Barnwell waste disposal facility which is owned by South Carolina. We believe that the Atlantic Compact will provide for adequate low-level radioactive waste disposal for Salem and Hope Creek through the end of their current licenses including full decommissioning, although no assurances can be given. Low-Level Radioactive Waste is periodically being shipped to the Barnwell site from Salem and Hope Creek. Additionally, there are on-site storage facilities for Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom, which we believe have the capacity for at least five years of temporary storage for each facility.
