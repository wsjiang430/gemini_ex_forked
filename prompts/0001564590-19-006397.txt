Item 1. Business. 
 Overview Our mission is to extend human healthspan. We define healthspan, or healthy longevity, as the period of one’s life unburdened by the diseases of aging. Enabled by foundational scientific insights, we have devoted over seven years to identifying multiple mechanisms that we believe to be root causes of age-related disease. We are utilizing these insights to develop a broad portfolio of drug candidates to treat these diseases of aging, and we initiated our first clinical study of our lead drug candidate in the second quarter of 2018. We believe our team of scientific, clinical, and business leaders, and our strong culture of collaboration with external scientists make us uniquely qualified to accomplish our ambitious mission. 
 Age-related diseases such as arthritis, vision loss, and cognitive decline cause considerable economic, personal, and societal burden. As individuals age, the prevalence of chronic disease increases, with 80% of older Americans having at least one chronic disease and 50% having two or more. Age-related diseases negatively impact quality of life, are typically chronic, and progress from the time of onset until death. It is estimated that providing healthcare for people over the age of 65 costs four to five times more than for younger individuals. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this elderly population of Americans is expected to nearly double by 2050, increasing the economic burden of aging dramatically. Any success increasing longevity without treating underlying diseases of aging would only serve to increase this burden. 
 We have developed a portfolio of programs targeting specific biological mechanisms implicated in diseases of aging and a pipeline of drug candidates to attack specific age-related diseases, beginning with musculoskeletal, ophthalmologic, and pulmonary indications. 
 Cellular Senescence 
 We believe that the accumulation of senescent cells is a fundamental mechanism of aging and a major driver of many common age-related diseases. Cellular senescence is a natural biological state in which a cell permanently halts division. These cells are referred to as senescent. As senescent cells accumulate with age, they begin secreting large quantities of more than 100 proteins, including inflammatory factors, proteases, fibrotic factors, and growth factors, that disturb the tissue micro-environment. This collection of secreted proteins is referred to as the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype, or SASP. In addition to its effects on tissue function, the SASP contains factors that induce senescence in neighboring cells, setting off a cascade of events that culminates in the formation of the functionally aged and/or diseased tissue that underlies a variety of age-related diseases. 
 Senolytic medicines selectively eliminate senescent cells and stop the production of the SASP at its source, which we believe addresses a root cause of diseases of aging. Many existing therapeutics, such as antibodies, target single SASP factors, but fail to remove the cells that continually produce multiple SASP factors. By stopping the production of the SASP at it source, we believe senolytic medicines could have a more durable impact on disease and could slow, halt, or reverse particular diseases of aging, and shift the treatment paradigm from chronic to intermittent dosing. Less frequent dosing may also improve drug tolerability and patient adherence. We are developing a number of molecules that we refer to as senolytic medicines. 
 Our Pipeline 
 We are developing a portfolio of programs targeting specific biological mechanisms implicated in diseases of aging. Our core therapeutic approach targets cellular senescence, and we are currently advancing senescence programs in musculoskeletal, ophthalmologic, and pulmonary disorders. Our clinical development strategy is initially focused on the development of senolytic medicines designed to be administered locally into diseased tissue. After demonstrating efficacy in indications amenable to localized therapy, we plan to pursue the development of senolytic medicines that could be administered systemically to treat additional age-related diseases such as kidney disease, liver disease and neurological disorders. In addition to our efforts to eliminate senescent cells, we are also advancing other programs that have the potential to extend human healthspan, including the administration of circulating youth factors and the enhancement of mitochondrial function.

Our current pipeline of programs is illustrated below: 

Within our cellular senescence programs, our lead senolytic molecules, UBX0101 and UBX1967, designed for local treatment for the removal of accumulated senescent cells, are described below:
 Musculoskeletal/Osteoarthritis Programs
 UBX0101 is our lead drug candidate for musculoskeletal disease with an initial focus on osteoarthritis, or OA, of the knee. It is a potent senolytic small molecule inhibitor of the MDM2/p53 interaction. Disruption of this protein-protein interaction can trigger the elimination of senescent cells. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical study in OA of the knee in the second quarter of 2018 and we expect initial results from this Phase 1 clinical study in the second quarter of 2019. We own, co-own or have exclusively licensed worldwide rights for the use of UBX0101 for the treatment of OA.  See “—Intellectual Property.”
 Ophthalmology Program
 UBX1967 is our most advanced lead drug candidate for age-related diseases of the eye, including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This drug candidate is a potent senolytic small molecule inhibitor of specific members of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulatory proteins.  UBX1967 inhibits the function of proteins that senescent cells rely on for survival. In our preclinical studies, we have demonstrated that by targeting this pathway UBX1967 preferentially eliminates senescent cells while sparing non-senescent cells. We plan to submit an IND application for UBX1967 in early 2020 that, if accepted, would enable us to pursue multiple age-related eye indications in clinical trials.  Under a license agreement with Ascentage Pharma Group Corp Limited, we have exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights and non-exclusive manufacturing rights to UBX1967 outside of Greater China (China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) in all non-oncology indications  Inside Greater China, we will be obligated to develop, manufacture and commercialize UBX1967 through a joint venture with Ascentage.   See “—Licenses and Collaborations.” 
Our Strategy 
 To achieve our objective of building Unity into a leading healthspan company, we focus on two parallel efforts. First, we are committed to developing senolytic medicines that slow, halt, or reverse specific diseases of aging. Second, we dedicate significant resources and effort to better understand fundamental aging mechanisms and translating these insights into human medicines. This pioneering work is supported by valuable collaborations with leading academics. By investing early in the science of aging, we believe we are positioned to transition the field of 
 5


aging biology from fundamental scientific insights to the development and commercialization of medicines. Our core strategies to achieve this objective include: 
  
• | Demonstrate in our clinical studies that local treatment with senolytic medicines can alter the course of age-related diseases. We believe that local treatment with senolytic medicines has the potential to slow, halt, or reverse aspects of aging. If we prove this concept in a localized setting, we will be well-positioned to expand upon that success with numerous additional applications. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue research into the development of systemic senolytic medicines. We believe that harnessing the full potential of senolysis, or the selective elimination of senescent cells, to alter many diseases of aging will require systemic senolytic medicines. We intend to explore the development of systemic senolytic medicines using multiple modalities, including small molecules and biologics. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Target aging mechanisms beyond cellular senescence. While cellular senescence and senolysis have been shown to affect the course of multiple diseases of aging, we believe achieving our broader goal of extending human healthspan will require intervention in additional aging mechanisms beyond cellular senescence. We will continue to conduct fundamental research into these other aging mechanisms, including loss of circulating youth factors and mitochondrial dysfunction. We will also continue to partner with the most forward-thinking aging researchers in the world to foster a collaborative environment to bring their insights, innovation, and technologies into our powerful research and drug development infrastructure. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our core science and biotechnology experience. We strive to attract, retain, and incentivize a unique team with significant strengths and experience in basic science, biotechnology, medicinal chemistry, and clinical development. Over the last seven years, our team has identified multiple mechanisms that can selectively eliminate senescent cells, created potent senolytic molecules, and developed proprietary animal models to monitor senescent cell clearance. We have developed significant insight into the relationship between the accumulation of senescent cells and human disease. Further, our management team has extensive biotechnology and pharmaceutical experience, and has played a leadership role in the creation of numerous FDA-approved medicines. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Opportunistically expand our product portfolio. Our internal research has identified multiple biological pathways that are potential targets for diseases of aging. We will search for opportunities to in-license novel medicines that can rapid enter clinical development. We expect that our current leadership in the biology of cellular senescence will serve as a foundation for us to develop numerous products to treat human disease. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to build a robust and defensible patent portfolio. We are an innovative biotechnology company focused on developing novel insights into the biology and diseases of aging. Our current patent portfolio consists, on a worldwide basis, of 30 issued and allowed patents and more than 100 additional pending patent applications which we own, co-own or have exclusively licensed. We intend to continue to aggressively develop, file, and pursue additional patent protection for our innovative technologies and products.

 Healthspan and Diseases of Aging
 Age-related diseases such as arthritis, vision loss, and cognitive decline cause considerable economic, personal and societal burden. As individuals age, the prevalence of chronic disease increases, with 80% of older Americans having at least one chronic disease and 50% having two or more. This deterioration of health negatively impacts quality of life, and age-related diseases are typically chronic and persist from the time of onset until death.
 Diseases of aging drive significant healthcare spending. It is estimated that providing healthcare for people over the age of 65 costs four to five times more than for younger individuals. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services expect health spending in the United States, or U.S., to exceed $5.2 trillion by 2025, which is equal to approximately 20% of the projected U.S. gross national product for the same year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the population of Americans aged 65 years or older is expected to nearly double by 2050, dramatically increasing the economic burden of aging. Moreover, diseases associated with aging have a detrimental impact on quality of life and older adults are often less optimistic about their future. Of the 34 million 
 6


family caregivers in the U.S. who support aging relatives, many experience a deterioration in their own health and well-being as a result. 
 We believe that by creating medicines that target fundamental aging mechanisms, we can reduce the economic, personal, and societal burden of aging and enhance quality of life. 

 Our Approach to Extending Human Healthspan 
 Causes of Cellular Senescence 
 Cellular senescence is a natural biological state in which a cell permanently halts division. Cells become senescent when they experience some form of unresolvable cellular stress. To date, six stress mechanisms have been identified that can cause a cell to become senescent, including (i) extensive cell division and telomere shortening, (ii) DNA damage, (iii) oxidative stress, (iv) high concentration glucose, (v) mitochondrial dysfunction, and (vi) activation of a cancer-causing gene. 
 These cellular stress events result in the activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which drives the production of two cell-cycle dependent kinase inhibitors, or CDK inhibitors, p21 and p16. These two molecules are required for the establishment and subsequent maintenance of the senescent cell state. The first CDK inhibitor to be produced is p21, which works through subsequent pathways to block the production of numerous proteins that cells need to divide. The initial p21-driven signal is an acute response to cell damage and eventually decreases. In contrast, p16 permanently locks the cell into a non-dividing state and the production of p16 continues as long as the cell lives. Given that p16 production, in most cases, continues indefinitely and is believed to be produced almost exclusively in senescent cells, it is a widely used marker to identify and quantify senescent cells. 
 The process through which stress mechanisms can induce cells to become senescent is illustrated in the figure below. 
  

How Senescent Cells Drive Diseases of Aging: The SASP 
 Once cells become senescent, they begin secreting large quantities of more than 100 proteins, including pro-inflammatory factors that recruit the immune system, proteases that remodel the extra-cellular matrix, pro-fibrotic factors that drive the formation of dysfunctional matrix, and growth factors that perturb the function of the tissue 
 7


micro-environment. This collection of secreted proteins is referred to as the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype, or SASP. In addition to its effects on tissue function, the SASP contains factors that induce senescence in neighboring cells, setting off a cascade of events that ultimately culminates in the formation of a functionally aged and/or diseased tissue that underlies a variety of age-related diseases. This process is illustrated in the figure below. 
 

Numerous SASP factors have been implicated as potentially contributing to human disease and it is now believed that the SASP is the primary means by which senescent cells drive specific diseases of aging. For example, a variety of single SASP factors (TNF-α and VEGF-A) have been demonstrated to drive human diseases by themselves and have been the target of well-known antibody therapeutics, including HUMIRA® and EYLEA®. While these antibodies are able to modify human disease by removing the activity of a single SASP factor, we believe the clearance of senescent cells will remove the source of numerous SASP factors, providing improvement in both efficacy and duration-of-effect. 
 Our Therapeutic Paradigm 
 We were founded on the principle that the selective elimination of senescent cells and their accompanying SASP has the potential to slow, halt, or reverse diseases of aging. Our insights into senescent cell biology allow us to 
 8


identify senescence-driven diseases, target the senescent cells driving a particular disease, and selectively eliminate these cells. The figure below illustrates this process. 
 

In developing this approach, we have acquired significant expertise with respect to senescent cell survival pathways, which are the signaling systems that senescent cells rely on for survival. When these pathways are inhibited with specifically designed molecules, senescent cells undergo programmed cell death. Through our research, we have identified several of these mechanistically distinct survival pathways, which differ depending on cell type and the tissue in which the senescent cells reside. 
 Using small molecules, we have cataloged these survival pathways on a cell-type-by-cell-type basis into a database we refer to as the ATLAS. The database indicates the survival pathways on which specific senescent cell types depend thereby elucidating vulnerabilities in those cells that can be exploited by the administration of senolytic molecules to trigger the selective elimination of these cells. The ATLAS provides us with a map of chemical starting points for the creation of senolytic medicines. 

 Advantages of Our Approach 
 We believe that senolytic medicines—medicines that selectively eliminate senescent cells from diseased tissues—may have four advantages over other efforts to treat age-related diseases: 
  
• | Senolytic medicines target a root cause of diseases of aging. We believe that the accumulation of senescent cells is a root cause of many diseases of aging. Unlike treatments that inhibit the activity of a single factor (such as antibodies targeting single pro-inflammatory proteins), we believe a senolytic medicine that selectively eliminates accumulated senescent cells and consequently also their associated SASP, could blunt the activity of numerous factors contributing to disease. As a result, senolytic medicines could have improved efficacy because they target diseases at their source and therefore may be able to normalize tissue levels of numerous disease-causing factors simultaneously. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Senolytic medicines can be dosed intermittently. The administration of senolytic medicines would remove senescent cells from diseased tissue. As new senescent cells may take months or even years to re-accumulate, senolytic medicines could potentially be dosed infrequently. We believe that intermittent dosing (rather than ongoing chronic dosing) could restore normal tissue function such that further drug administration would not be required until senescent cells have re-accumulated. Intermittent dosing may also improve drug tolerability and patient adherence when compared to chronic therapies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Senescent cells accumulate at sites of disease, simplifying multiple aspects of clinical development. We believe senescent cells accumulate at sites of disease and drive disease through their accompanying SASP. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our ability to quantify senescent cells and accompanying SASP factors in sites of disease may simplify clinical development in a number of ways. First, we can simplify indication selection to pursue the development of senolytic medicines for diseases in which we observe the local accumulation of senescent cells. Second, it is possible to identify patients that may better respond to senolytic medicines based on p16 expression and other biomarkers of senescence. Third, we can potentially monitor patients for response to therapy by tracking the reduction of senescence-associated biomarkers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Senolytic medicines restore tissues to a healthy state. We believe senescent cells generally do not accumulate in young individuals and that the accumulation of senescent cells is unnecessary for normal tissue function. Our goal for the administration of senolytic medicines is to restore tissue to a functionally younger state. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Discovery and Development Strategy 
 We believe that each of our senolytic programs has the potential to address a root cause of an age-related disease. Our clinical development strategy is initially to develop senolytic medicines designed to be administered locally into diseased tissue (either by injection or inhalation), which reduces systemic toxicological risks by limiting drug exposure largely to the treated tissue. After demonstrating safety and efficacy in indications amenable to localized therapy, we plan to pursue the development of senolytic medicines that could be administered systemically, initially acting on specific tissues for which direct local administration is challenging. Ultimately, we envision the potential for systemic administration of senolytic medicines to selectively eliminate senescent cells throughout the body to treat diseases of aging that are not amenable to local treatment, such as kidney, liver, and heart disease. We are also developing medicines that act on aging mechanisms beyond cellular senescence, such as those that address the loss of circulating youth factors and enhance mitochondrial health. By targeting specific biological mechanisms that are implicated in diseases of aging, our vision is to address the body as a whole, reducing age-related diseases and extending human healthspan. 
Cellular Senescence Biology Program
 Musculoskeletal/Osteoarthritis Programs 
 Unmet Need and Therapeutic Rationale 
 Diseases of the musculoskeletal system represent one of the leading causes of disability in the world, particularly among the aging population. According to the 2015 World Health Organization World Report on Ageing and Health, musculoskeletal diseases account for the most time those over age 50 in the developed world spend living with a disability. To date, senescence has been linked with osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, and intervertebral (spine) facet joints, degeneration of intervertebral discs, and loss of bone density. 
 Osteoarthritis, or OA, is a degenerative disease that negatively impacts subchondral bone and the synovial tissue surrounding the joint, causing pain and physical impairment. The effect of tissue degeneration causes the normally smooth joint layers to become fragmented and pitted, the synovial tissue to become inflamed and thickened, and the bone to develop abnormal morphology, all of which lead to a decrease in joint function and mobility, pain, and physical impairment. OA is a highly prevalent disease, symptomatically affecting as many as 10% to 15% of the world’s population over age 60, and results in a decline in quality of life. The most common joint affected by OA is the knee, followed by the hip, ankle, and shoulder. Importantly, the current standard of care begins with symptomatic treatment that temporarily addresses joint inflammation or pain control. The natural progression of treatment often results in joint replacement surgery. Based on data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) for 2009, the aggregate cost of knee and hip replacements in the United States was $42.3 billion. The overall cost of OA is estimated to be greater than $150 billion per year in the United States. 
 OA of the knee is believed to be a heterogeneous and multifactorial disease.  We believe that the accumulation of senescent cells and associated SASP are significant contributing factors in OA disease. A number of SASP factors are secreted by senescent cells into the tissue and/or synovial fluid surrounding an affected joint, including (i) cytokines and chemokines which may cause inflammation, such as the interleukins IL-1ß and IL-6; (ii) proteases and protease inhibitors, which may cause tissue degradation, such as MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13; and (iii) growth 
 10


factors and adhesion molecules, which may lead to tissue remodeling, such as VEGFC and ICAM-1. The presence and concentrations of these SASP factors may vary based on the tissue and fluid type, however we believe these SASP factors lead to cartilage loss, inflammation of the synovial membrane, abnormalities to bone, degeneration of the joint cartilage, and pain.
 Evidence for Cellular Senescence Burden in Human Disease and Human Biomarker Discovery 
 To evaluate the link between cellular senescence, SASP accumulation and OA disease, we conducted a non-interventional biomarker study in 30 patients with primary OA of the knee. The enrolled patients displayed a range of OA disease between grades 1 and 4 based on an X-ray scoring system called the Kellgren-Lawrence, or KL, grade.  The KL grade is a common tool used to classify extent of OA with scores ranging from 0, referring to no disease, to grade 4, referring to severe disease. During the study, patients underwent knee MRI imaging with contrast enhancement and arthroscopy, a fiber optic surgical device inserted into the knee joint, for biopsy of synovial membrane and non-weight bearing cartilage. They also provided blood and urine, and underwent pain scoring, as measured by the WOMAC-A sub-scale, a commonly used standardized questionnaire, to evaluate their OA disease status and its relationship to senescent cell burden. 
 Immunohistochemistry, or IHC, of the sampled tissue demonstrated p16-positive cells affecting a number of cell types within the synovial membrane. The degree of senescence was quantified in these samples by measuring the percentage of p16 positive cells relative to the total cell number in the specimen. 
 Several significant findings were identified by assessing the relationship between the percent of p16-positive cells and other measures in this study.  First, the extent of senescence was significantly correlated with the concentration of IL-6, a well-established inflammatory marker associated with OA.(Figure 1A). Second, the extent of senescence in the synovial membrane from each patient showed statistically significant correlation to the amount of pain each of those patients experienced at the start of the study, based on the WOMAC-A pain sub-scale (Figure 1B). Third, the extent of senescence in the synovial membrane, including examining specific individual areas within the knee, showed statistically significantly correlation with the MRI-based synovitis score that evaluates 11 different regions within the knee (Figure 1C). Finally, a relationship trend was identified when assessing the correlation between the extent of senescence and the grade of disease based on the KL grade. When evaluating the relationship in patients with mild to moderately severe disease (KL grades 1-3), this relationship was statistically significant (Figure 1D).

 Mechanism of Action of UBX0101 
 UBX0101 is a small molecule inhibitor of the MDM2/p53 protein-protein interaction. The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that regulates a broad set of genes that control cellular functions including cell cycle arrest, cell death (or apoptosis), and senescence. MDM2 is a protein-ubiquitin ligase that marks proteins for destruction. UBX0101 binds to MDM2, raising p53 levels and causing senescent cells to undergo apoptosis. 
 Preclinical Studies with UBX0101 
 We conducted in vitro experiments to study the potency of UBX0101 and its ability to eliminate senescent cells. In vitro studies demonstrate that UBX0101 is a potent inducer of p53 expression and senescent cell apoptosis. This confirmed that UBX0101 elevates p53 and eliminates senescent cells. In particular, treatment of irradiated human fetal lung fibroblasts, or IMR90, and irradiated human primary synovial fibroblasts exhibited a dose-dependent potent reduction of senescent cell survival. IMR90 cells have been the cell line used to study senescence biology for the past 30 years. These cells are used to study senescence in vitro because they are normal cells without acquired mutations that could drive resistance to drug-induced apoptosis. We use IMR90 and synovial fibroblast cells as our primary screens and complement these two cell types with disease-relevant primary cell cultures to confirm that mechanisms of senescence translate to the relevant cell type. 
 We next studied the in vivo efficacy of UBX0101 in a mouse model of OA. We used the mouse anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, transection model in which the ACL is transected in a surgical procedure after which the mouse is allowed to recover for 14 days. This model induces an aggressive form of OA characterized by inflammation, cartilage degeneration, and pain. We selected this model as it has demonstrated the accumulation of senescent cells. Intra-articular, or IA, dosing of our clinical candidate, UBX0101, led to a dose-dependent reduction of senescent cells as measured by lowering the expression of p16 (Figure 2A) and a reduced expression of SASP factors, including IL-1ß (Figure 2B) and MMP-13 (Figure 2C), each in whole knee homogenate. Although attempts to replicate these findings in different animal models of OA proved to be challenging, as it is difficult to mimic a disease like OA, which 
 12


develops over a long period of time in humans, in short-term animal models, these mouse model data further support our hypothesis that elimination of senescent cells with UBX0101 leads to changes in accompanying SASP. 
  
Figures 2A, 2B and 2C. IA dosing of UBX0101 reduces p16 expression (*p<0.05) and OA-relevant SASP factors, including IL-1ß and MMP-13 expression levels in the ACLT murine model. 
 We also conducted an ex vivo study in which cartilage (chondrocytes) from active OA lesions was obtained from human knees following total knee replacement surgery and then placed in culture and treated with UBX0101. The regions of high OA disease tissue burden correlated well with higher p16 and MMP-13 biomarker levels, which we believe is a key indicator of cellular senescence-driven disease within cartilage. When treated with UBX0101, the number of p16 positive cells and cells expressing MMP-13 were greatly reduced. In addition, the expression of two key proteins, type 2 collagen and aggrecan, were significantly upregulated (n=4; *p≤0.05)). These two proteins are among the most abundant components of cartilage. These data suggest that chondrocytes from patients with end-stage OA are capable of synthesizing new cartilage once accumulated senescent cells are removed. As a result, we believe that intervening in vivo in humans could not only slow the progression of OA, but could also induce a reparative state in which more functional tissue is restored.
 The potential for local toxicity was assessed in GLP-compliant studies after a single-dose intra-articular injection in both rabbits (doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 mg/joint) and canines (doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/joint). Findings from these rabbit and canine studies showed that a single intra-articular administration of UBX0101 was well tolerated at doses up to 0.6 mg/joint in the rabbit and 1 mg/joint in the canine, the highest doses tested in the GLP toxicity studies. UBX0101-related histopathological findings after a single intra-articular injection were limited to fibrinoid degeneration and mixed cell inflammation of the synovium in canines. Neither the degeneration nor the inflammation was considered adverse at any dose level due to the minimal severity of the changes. There was no evidence of systemic toxicity in the canines following intra-articular injection. Although histopathological findings were noted in earlier exploratory rabbit studies performed at high doses (up to 9 mg/joint), no UBX0101-related findings in the joint or evidence of systemic toxicity were noted in the 2017 GLP toxicity study conducted in rabbits. 
 The potential systemic toxicity was evaluated in GLP-compliant toxicity studies after a single oral administration in both rats (doses of 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg) and canines (doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg). In these studies, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was 300 mg/kg in rats and 100 mg/kg in canines. At doses of 100 mg/kg and above, adverse effects after oral dosing consisted of transient, reversible and monitorable clinical signs in canines (300 mg/kg), decrease in body weight in canines (100 and 300 mg/kg) and rats (600 mg/kg) and clinical pathology changes (decrease in hematopoietic populations and increase in hepatic parameters) in both canines (100 and 300 mg/kg) and rats (300 and 600 mg/kg). At pathological examination, changes in hematopoietic organs were noted in both rats (600 mg/kg) and dogs (100 and 300 mg/kg) whereas non-adverse liver-related changes were observed in rats only (300 and 600 mg/kg). These effects were observed at systemic exposures that are greater than 800-fold the anticipated maximum exposure in patient after a single intra articular injection. 
 The potential genotoxicity of UBX0101 was evaluated in the following GLP studies: (i) a bacterial reverse mutation assay (in vitro) at concentrations up to 5000 µg/plate, (ii) a chromosome aberration assay (in vitro) at concentrations ranging from 0.25 µg/ml to 300 µg/ml, and (iii) a rat micronucleus assay (oral/once) at doses of 500, 
 13


1000 and 2000 mg/kg. In these studies, UBX0101 was non-mutagenic in bacterial species up to a concentration of 5000 ug/plate and it was weakly positive in vitro for inducing chromosomal aberrations, which is consistent with the pharmacological activity of UBX0101. It was negative for inducing polyploidy and endoreduplication in cultured human lymphocytes and negative in the in vivo rat micronucleus at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg, the maximum recommended dose based on regulatory guidelines. 
 We also conducted the following safety pharmacology studies: (i) hERG channel in mammalian cells (in vitro) at concentrations of 1, 3, 10 and 30 µM, (ii) central nervous system in rat (oral/once) at doses of 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg, (iii) cardiovascular in canine (oral/once) at doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg, and (iv) respiratory in rat at doses of 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg. These studies indicated that the risk for significant hERG inhibition in vivo is minimal. UBX0101 demonstrated a low potential for cardiovascular effects in canines (NOAEL of 30 mg/kg) and did not produce any effect on ventilatory function or neurobehavioral effects in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg (the no-observed-effect-level, or NOEL) when given as a single oral administration. 
 The nonclinical exploratory and GLP studies have demonstrated that findings related to the proposed clinical intra-articular route of administration are generally non-adverse and likely to be reversible. There was no systemic toxicity noted after intra-articular injection in safety assessment studies at any dose level tested. Estimated UBX0101 knee concentrations at the NOAEL from the safety studies were 38-fold higher than the exposures required to achieve the EC50 concentration in the in vitro OA knee efficacy model. Based on the findings of our preclinical studies, we believe the safety pharmacology and toxicology studies support the evaluation of UBX0101 in the Phase 1 clinical program. 
 UBX0101 Development Plan 
 In the second quarter of 2018, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical study in patients with moderate to severe OA of the knee. This Phase 1 study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the safety and tolerability of single, ascending intra-articular doses of UBX0101. In the initial phase, or Part A, of the study, 48 patients were randomly assigned to receive UBX0101 or placebo in 3:1 randomization by dose level cohort. Primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include plasma pharmacokinetics, synovitis as measured by MRI, pain, and SASP factors in synovial fluid and plasma. Patients will be followed for a total of 12 weeks following treatment administration, at which time key endpoints will be assessed.
 In the first quarter of 2019, we expanded the study to include a second phase, or Part B, with an additional cohort of at least 24 patients with the highest safe and tolerated dose level evaluated during Part A of the study (4 mg). Part B is intended to supplement Part A by further evaluating the impact of UBX0101 on SASP factors. In Part B, patients will be randomized to receive UBX0101 or placebo in a 2:1 randomization. Primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints include SASP factors in synovial fluid and plasma, pain, and drug exposure. Synovial fluid samples will be obtained pre-treatment and at four weeks. Key endpoints will be assessed at four weeks and patients will be followed for a total of six weeks following treatment administration. We expect top-line results from both Part A and Part B in the second quarter of 2019. 
 OA of the knee is believed to be a heterogeneous and multifactorial disease where multiple SASP factors are implicated in pathogenesis. While evidence suggests that individual SASP factors contribute to OA disease pathology, it is our belief that suppression of multiple factors is likely needed for a meaningful clinical benefit to be observed. The Phase 1 study will evaluate the impact of UBX0101 on SASP factors (24 in synovial fluid and 8 plasma) believed to play a role in human OA. The factors were selected based on our Ph 0 OA biomarker study, pre-clinical data, and an extensive literature review. These factors, which include cytokines and chemokines, proteases and protease inhibitors, and growth factors and adhesion molecules, will be measured for change from baseline to 12 weeks in Part A and from baseline to 4 weeks in Part B (Figure 3).

 At the conclusion of Parts A and B of this study, if the results are positive, we expect to have the option to use the  safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic data from Parts A and B, to support the further expansion of selected cohorts to sufficiently power a proof-of-concept study for the assessment of pain and inflammation. Additionally, we may also conduct a repeated dose study to optimize the dosing regimen for future trials.
 Ophthalmology Programs 
 Unmet Need and Therapeutic Rationale 
 The majority of significant eye diseases are age related, with the prevalence of vision-threatening disease increasing significantly over the age of 75. Of the 285 million individuals worldwide living with visual impairment, 65% are over the age of 50. The individual diseases that are associated with these figures include age-related macular degeneration, diabetic eye diseases and glaucoma, all of which have a high prevalence and significant unmet need in either prevention or therapeutic options. The diseases we are evaluating as initial target indications for local administration of senolytic therapy in the eye are age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, diabetic retinopathy, and primary open angle glaucoma. 
Age-Related Macular Degeneration 
 Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in people over the age of 65 in the United States, where there are an estimated 2.1 million people with AMD. This number is projected to more than double by 2050, reaching 5.4 million. The prevalence of AMD increases significantly with advancing age, with a prevalence of 2.8% in those aged 65 to 74 years, increasing to 8.7% in those over 75 years. AMD affects central vision, impairing functions such as reading, driving, and facial recognition, and has a major impact on quality of life and the ability to live independently. AMD is defined in three stages: (i) “early,” in which visual function is affected in the presence of signs of age-related changes in the retina such as drusen and pigmentary changes, (ii) “intermediate,” in which increasing degrees of macular lipid deposition and structural changes are noted, and (iii) “late,” in which central vision is severely compromised due to abnormal blood vessel growth (known as “wet” AMD) or advanced atrophy of the retina (known as “dry” AMD). It is a heterogenous, complex, multifactorial disease, with inflammatory, degenerative, genetic, and vascular factors all contributing to its development and progression. The 
 15


potential role of senescent cells and the associated SASP in driving the two main presentations of the disease, both wet and dry forms, could prove a unifying mechanism across this complex disorder. 
 Standard of care for AMD is limited to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or anti-VEGF, drugs which control aspects of the wet form of the disease only. Therapeutic options for dry AMD have proven challenging with no currently approved therapies available to slow progression or reverse disease. Wet AMD has been significantly impacted by anti-VEGF therapy but that approach is limited by the need for frequent, long-term eye injections, a significant percentage of patients not completing or being non-responsive or poorly-responsive to anti-VEGF therapy, and the contribution of multiple other mechanisms at play in the disease beyond VEGF. Thus, there is considerable potential for a senolytic approach to impact disease progression and achieve stabilization in AMD via modulation of senescent cell burden and the accompanying SASP. SASP factors in AMD include molecules that promote abnormal blood vessel growth, inflammation, and fibrosis, all of which have been implicated in various stages of the disease. It is our hypothesis that a senolytic medicine could have a meaningful and prolonged impact on the AMD disease state and help restore the cellular microenvironment to a more normal, pre-senescent state.
 Diabetic Macular Edema 
 The prevalence of diabetic macular edema, or DME, in the U.S. ranges from approximately 4.0 to 6.8% of people with diabetes who are 40 years of age or older. There is a high burden of DME among non-Hispanic blacks and robust associations with higher hemoglobin A1c and longer duration of underlying diabetes.
 Because the prevalence of DME increases with increasing duration of hyperglycemia, retinopathy is more likely to be found in eyes of patients who have a longer interval between the onset of diabetes and its discovery. Lower frequencies of DME would be expected in asymptomatic people who are discovered to have diabetes by testing during population-based studies. These people are probably closer to the time of “onset” of their diabetes than symptomatic patients who are discovered to have Type 2 diabetes by their physicians.
 Despite the success achieved with anti-VEGF treatment for retinal disease like AMD that involve the proliferation of abnormal blood vessels, or neovascularization, in DME, the impact of this therapeutic approach has been limited. This is due to poor patient compliance with the regimen (monthly and or bimonthly IVT injections), the number of cases that are refractory to anti-VEGF treatment (50% of DME patients), and the long-term complication of increased ischemia and retinal fibrosis associated with long-term treatment with anti-VEGF injections. As a result there is an unmet need in this group of patients. Although VEGF has been identified as a primary biomarker for neovascular disease, other biomarkers, which we believe are SASP factors, are present in DME (including IL-1ß, TNF-a, IL-6, and TGF-ß, among others). Due to the multifactorial nature of the disease, a significant opportunity exists to develop a more comprehensive approach to the treatment of DME that targets the root cause of the disease.
 Diabetic Retinopathy 
 Diabetic retinopathy, or DR, is estimated to affect over 90 million people globally and approximately 28 million have vision-threatening stages of disease. It is a leading cause of vision loss in middle-aged and elderly people and impacts 8% of the U.S. population over age 65. Due to the increasing diabetic population arising from lifestyle changes in developing countries, the disease incidence is predicted to climb. 
 Diabetic retinopathy is a complex multifactorial disease, characterized by progression through a series of stages of increasing severity. High glucose levels incite a variety of inflammatory and a number of metabolic stress-induced events leading to proliferation of neovascularization, with subsequent bleeding and swelling causing visual loss. The risk of developing diabetic retinopathy and its severity increase with the duration of underlying diabetes. It is also associated with poor glycemic control and the presence of additional coexistent diseases, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and impaired kidney function. 
 Current standard of care for diabetic retinopathy, which includes blood sugar control, anti-VEGF drugs, and laser therapy, is modestly effective. Limitations of existing therapy include general challenges with achieving diabetes control, the need for frequent intra-vitreal injections for the administration of anti-VEGF therapy, a significant percentage of patients not completing or being non-responsive to anti-VEGF therapy, and tissue destruction with 
 16


permanent side effects from laser therapy. This presents a significant opportunity to design and develop a treatment paradigm that treats a root cause of the disease. 
 Evidence suggests that diabetic retinopathy is driven by the accumulation of senescent cells that are a direct result of elevated glucose levels in patients with diabetes. These senescent cells are triggered by local stresses in the retina and their accumulation drives the production of the accompanying ocular SASP factors, VEGF and PDGF. Overproduction of VEGF and IL-6 leads to ocular inflammation and abnormal blood vessel growth, key signatures of the causes of diabetic retinopathy. Thus, a senolytic approach could target multiple aspects of the underlying causes of diabetic retinopathy and ideally lead to greater therapeutic coverage in a wider range of patients. By eliminating senescent cell accumulation and accompanying SASP factors, one could limit further disease progression, reduce vessel leakage and inflammation, and prevent vision loss. 
 Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma 
 Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world, with an estimated 60 million cases worldwide. There are approximately 2.7 million people in the United States with glaucoma, with up to 50% of cases undetected as the result of the disease typically being asymptomatic until very late in the course of its progression. This number is projected to reach 6.3 million by 2050 and age is one of the strongest risk factors for the development of the disease. Prevalence in general increases with age, with 2.5% prevalence between the ages of 55 and 64, 5.7% between 65 and 74 and 10.3% over the age of 75. 
 Primary open-angle glaucoma, or POAG, is a degeneration of nerve cells in the retina characterized by a progressive loss of retinal nerve function. This occurs due to abnormalities in the outflow channels, which are referred to as the trabecular meshwork, or TM, of the front portion of the eye such that removal of aqueous humor, or AH fluid, no longer balances AH production. As a result, intra-ocular pressure, or IOP, increases. Before vision loss becomes prominent, POAG is an asymptomatic disease making screening examinations critical for early detection. There are no available therapies that restore lost visual function. With advancing disease, more central vision is lost and, if left untreated, total blindness can occur. There are no curative therapies for glaucoma. Treatment is lifelong and aimed at slowing progression of disease. Even with maximal therapy a proportion of patients will continue to progress, highlighting the significant unmet need in glaucoma treatment. 
 Current POAG management primarily includes strategies to lower IOP by medical and/or surgical means in an attempt to slow disease progression. IOP is a modifiable risk factor in glaucoma and therefore a target for therapy, yet it is known that IOP is but one of many factors in the complex pathophysiology of POAG. Topical therapeutic options to reduce IOP include prostaglandin analogues, cholinergic agonists, and ß-blockers. The major challenge in topical therapy is non-adherence with regimens that require at least daily dosing and are associated with significant tolerability profiles. Adherence rates with topical regimens at one year following prescription were reported to be between 10% and 40%. Compounding this problem is a greater than 40% incidence rate of intolerability issues and that 40% of patients require more than one medication to control IOP to their individual target range. Surgical options to control IOP include laser therapy, surgery to open the outflow channels, and micro-incisional glaucoma surgery. Surgical interventions are associated with greater risks and are in general reserved for more advanced cases. 
 Thus, POAG remains a high unmet medical need with significant opportunity for a sustained and durable IOP lowering therapy. We believe that POAG is driven by the accumulation of senescent cells and secretion of the SASP in the TM as a result of cellular stress and injury leading to decreased outflow of AH. A reduction in cellularity leading to changes in TM architecture has been described in glaucoma and supports our belief that a senolytic could have prolonged effect on IOP lowering through the clearance of senescent cells and reduction in SASP. 
 Evidence for Senescence Burden in Human Disease and Human Biomarker Discovery: AMD, DME and DR
 We evaluated the presence of senescent cells in retinal donor tissue from normal and AMD subject samples by IHC staining for p16. We believe that data supported our hypothesis that the accumulation of senescent cells is linked to AMD and is seen at the juncture between normal retina and AMD affected retina.  
 17


We have also evaluated the link between senescence in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells, or HRMEC, and human DME/DR patients by evaluating the gene expression of several disease-relevant factors. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, demonstrated elevations in VEGF, PDGF, IL-1ß, and TNF in senescent HRMEC, relative to non-senescent cells. These disease-relevant mediators have been reported to be elevated in DME/DR patients.  We believe this data is consistent with our hypothesis that senescent cell accumulation and SASP factors play a central role in both DME and DR. We further investigated this hypothesis by evaluating one of our proprietary senolytic molecules in an animal model of DR. 
 With recently optimized methods, we are now focused on quantifying the senescence burden in samples from normal donors verses donors with AMD and DME/DR.  We intend to use this method to identify the cell types that stain positive for p16, and the localization of disease-relevant factors which will assist in the development of AMD and DR models in cells and animal models.


Figure 4. Disease-relevant mediators are elevated in senescent HRMEC
 Evidence for Senescence Burden in Human Disease and Human Biomarker Discovery: POAG
 We evaluated the presence of senescent cells in the trabecular meshwork, or TM, by quantifying the detection of p16 positive cells in TM from control verses POAG patients. We are currently focused on utilizing optimized methods for the detection of p16-positive cells and co-localization with disease-relevant factors in human donor globes. In addition, we will have the opportunity to look for p16-positive senescent cells in POAG patient retinas.
 Mechanism of Action of UBX1967 (Inhibitors of the Bcl-2 Family) 
 The most advanced senolytic drug candidate in our ophthalmology program, UBX1967, is a potent small molecule inhibitor of specific subtypes within the Bcl-2 family of regulator proteins. The B-cell lymphoma 2, or Bcl-2, gene family encodes more than 20 proteins that regulate the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and are fundamental to the balance between cell survival and cell death. Inhibition of certain Bcl-2 family proteins results in cell death. Targeting this pathway has been extensively studied in connection with the search for new oncology medicines.  
 In vitro and in vivo Pharmacology Studies with UBX1967 
 We conducted an in vitro assessment of binding and efficacy to determine the potency of senolytic molecules for the Bcl-2 family protein targets and their potency at eliminating senescent cells. Biochemical assays for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w yielded binding affinities in the sub-nM range. In order to assess the activity of UBX1967 on senescent cells, we used a cell-based assay with radiation-induced senescence. Senescent cells were then exposed to increasing concentrations of UBX1967 for 72 hours. In this study, UBX1967 showed potent, dose-dependent senolytic activity against IMR90, human retinal pigmented epithelial cells, and HRMEC as measured by reduction of senescent cell survival. 
 UBX1967 demonstrated selectivity for elimination of senescent HRMEC over non-senescent HRMEC which is observed as decreased potency in non-senescent cells (Figure 5).
 18




Figure 5. Dose dependent induction of apoptosis in HRMEC cells
 We next studied the efficacy of UBX1967 in the eye in an in vivo model. We employed the mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy, or OIR, model, which provides an in vivo model of retinopathy of prematurity, or ROP, and DR. In this model, UBX1967 showed statistically significant improvement in the degree of neovascularization at all dose levels along with a reduction in the number of p16-positive senescent cells. We also identified a dosing formulation of UBX1967 that is compatible with clinical development, a polysorbate-80 (PS-80)-based solution formulation, which has demonstrated the same activity in this OIR model (Figure 6).
 

Figure 6. Intravitreal injection of UBX1967 reduced retinal neovascularization in the mouse OIR model
 19


Based on these results in this key OIR model, we believe a single ocular injection of UBX1967 can functionally inhibit pathogenic angiogenesis and promote vascular repair (Figure 7). 
 

Figure 7. Representative images from mouse OIR illustrate the reduction in neovascularization and vaso-obliteration after treatment with UBX1967
 We believe that efficacy of UBX1967 in the OIR model is due to elimination of senescent cells and accompanying SASP that propagates senescence in retinal cells and promotes neovascularization of retinal vessels. 
 We then studied in vivo efficacy in a mouse streptozotocin model to understand the effects of UBX1967 in a diabetic retina, which shows phenotypes similar to the human diseased condition. In this model,  UBX1967 demonstrated changes in the electroretinogram, or ERG, as a measure of retinal/photoreceptor function, vascular leakage, and production of several disease-relevant cytokines. UBX1967 showed a dose dependent reduction (1 – 100 µM) in IL-1ß and TNF mRNA (p<0.05 v. vehicle control) in the diabetic retina. Evans Blue dye permeation was measured as an indication of vascular leakage in the eye. Administration of UBX1967 significantly reversed leakage in the DMSO-based formulation (p<0.01) and demonstrated dose-dependent reversal in the PS-80-based formulation, although not statistically significant.  Finally, at doses of 1 – 100 µM delivered per eye, UBX1967 led to significant increase in the amplitude of both the A- and B-waves (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively) of the ERG when compared 
 20


to the vehicle control group. The UBX1967-treated groups were not significantly different from the non-diabetic control animals.

Figure 8.  Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice have increased cytokine expression (8A), increased retinal vascular leakage (8B) and decreased A-wave amplitude in ERG (8C).  Administration of UBX1967 attenuated each of these disease-relevant endpoints.
 We have also studied the in vivo efficacy of UBX1967 in a mouse model of elevated IOP, which is relevant to glaucoma. An experimental increase in IOP was induced in one eye of a mouse cohort by injection of bleomycin, a DNA damage agent known to cause fibrosis. Within the study design, the left eye of a single animal was used as a vehicle control (no insult and no treatment) while the right eye was subjected to insult and treatment with UBX1967. During the study we measured the level of p16 expression and intraocular pressure. We experienced some procedural challenges with this version of the elevated IOP model and we have recently employed a more refined technique to administer bleomycin and UBX1967.  Using these new refinements, we will now extend the study duration in order to measure neuron loss in the retina after administration of UBX1967.  Preliminary studies with a reference standard molecule indicate a decrease in bleomycin-induced IOP elevation and preservation of retinal ganglion cells. 
 We completed non-GLP non-clinical safety assessment, tolerability and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, or DMPK, studies with UBX1967 in two non-clinical species. In December 2018, we nominated UBX1967 as a development candidate to progress into GLP safety assessment studies to enable the filing of an IND. 
 21


Ophthalmology Development Plan 
 One of the properties of UBX1967 is a sustained exposure in ocular tissues of interest after intravitreal injection. After engaging regulatory authorities regarding the design of IND-enabling studies, we have determined that the duration of these non-clinical studies will be longer than originally anticipated due to the pharmacokinetic profile. As a result, we expect to file our IND for UBX1967 in early 2020 that, if accepted, would enable us to pursue multiple age-related diseases of the eye in clinical trials, such as AMD, DME and DR. 
 As part of our continued commitment to our ophthalmology indications, we have also designed a number of alternative senolytic molecules with differing mechanisms of action. We are also focused on the physiochemical properties of our small molecules and are developing approaches to optimize solubility, permeability, and PK parameters to create favorable ocular absorption, distribution, metabolism, and residency profiles. 
 Pulmonary Programs 
 Unmet Need and Therapeutic Rationale 
 Data from the World Health Organization from 2015 shows that respiratory diseases make up three of the top five causes of death worldwide, several of which are prevalent in the elderly. In addition, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the U.S. National Institutes of Health published a white paper in 2017 highlighting the association of age with lung disease, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, and underscoring the potential for understanding and developing therapeutics related to aging biology. 
 Historically, therapies for these diseases have been non-specific in their mode of action, whether anti-inflammatory (e.g., corticosteroids), or immunosuppressive (e.g., cyclophosphamide), or purely supportive in nature (e.g., supplemental oxygen). Increasingly, new therapies have been developed that are more targeted to specific pathogenic factors, such as anti-IL-5 antibody (mepolizumab) in COPD and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (nintedanib) in IPF. In contrast, the goal of senolytics is not just to interrupt specific pathogenic pathways but specifically to target senescent cells and thereby inhibit multiple pathogenic pathways. 
 We initiated an active discovery and development program in IPF based on a series of observations including the aggressive nature of the disease and data suggesting a potentially strong association between IPF and senescence. 
 IPF is a severely debilitating fibrotic disease of the lung that primarily affects older adults and often leads to a progressive worsening of lung function, eventually leading to respiratory failure or lung transplantation. Increasing organ fibrosis causes a restriction of ventilation that symptomatically is perceived as a constant state of suffocation. While the course of the disease is variable, the prognosis is uniformly poor with a median survival of about three to four years after diagnosis. In the United States, it is estimated to affect up to 90,000 people, with approximately 40,000 people dying each year. While the overall prevalence is not high, it increases substantially in people over the age of 65. The hypoxemia resulting from IPF ultimately necessitates the use of supplemental oxygen. Supplemental oxygen relieves dyspnea and improves functional status and may play a role in ameliorating associated comorbidities such as secondary pulmonary hypertension. However, the use of supplemental oxygen requires equipment for administration that can place significant burden on patients, limiting their mobility and profoundly reducing quality of life. 
 Beyond the use of oxygen, there are two marketed products available for the treatment of IPF, nintedanib and pirfenidone, that are recommended by the American Thoracic Society. In clinical studies, these anti-fibrotic agents slowed the rate of decline in lung function over 52 weeks but did not show a significant effect on survival or disease exacerbations. IPF remains a fatal disease for which additional effective therapies that treat the underlying lung fibrosis to improve quality of life and survival are needed. 
 Resident cell types within the lung, including epithelial cells and macrophages, have been shown to become senescent. Accumulation of these senescent cells followed by SASP secretion may drive IPF disease exacerbation and progression. In the case of senescent lung cells, we believe that the SASP is characterized in part by pro-fibrotic factors such as connective tissue growth factor CTGF and TGF-β. We believe that excessive and prolonged exposure to these factors leads to remodeling of the lung, expansion of lung matrix, and fibrosis, all of which deteriorate function and 
 22


ultimately result in death. Furthermore, these factors may also play a role in suppressing the endogenous capacity of the lung to demonstrate regenerative capacity that has been shown in patients after removal of diseased lung tissue, as well as during recuperation of those patients who survive Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, an injury that severely damages the lung. 
 Evidence for Cellular Senescence Burden in Human Disease and Human Biomarker Discovery 
 Our exploratory work in IPF resulted in the identification of senescent cells associated with areas of active disease in lung tissue taken from patients with IPF. Immunohistochemistry staining for p16 in human IPF lung tissue demonstrated the presence of senescent cells. These cells were predominantly epithelial in origin and located in areas of fibrosis and at the leading edge of the disease. These sites are likely amendable to access by inhalation therapeutics. 
 Importantly, the number of p16 positive cells was greater across all levels of fibrosis relative to that of normal tissue (p<0.0001 for group difference among means by one-way ANOVA). Additionally, there was a strong relationship between the extent of disease in a given area and the percentage of senescent cells present in those areas. At its peak, approximately 30% of the total cellularity in an affected region is comprised of senescent cells. These data support the hypothesis that elimination of senescent cells and its associated SASP could halt progressive fibrosis and potentially allow for restoration of pulmonary function. This further supports our hypothesis that IPF is related to SASP proliferation and suggests that treatment with senolytic molecules has the potential to treat the root cause of disease. We further studied our hypothesis regarding cellular senescence accumulation and their accompanying SASP by investigating the cellular senescence signature in a key animal model of lung fibrosis. 
 Preclinical Disease Model of Lung Fibrosis 
 Preclinical studies were conducted to understand the involvement of senescent cells in in vivo models of lung fibrosis. Based on initial results demonstrating a modest increase in whole lung senescence (p16 mRNA) following 
 23


local delivery of bleomycin, we validated an in vivo bleomycin-induced PD model focusing on enriched epithelial cells from mouse lungs and demonstrated a reduction in p16 mRNA following local senolytic treatment.


Figure 9. Epithelial cells enriched from mouse lungs treated with bleomycin exhibited an increase in p16 mRNA, which was significantly reduced following local senolytic treatment
 While preliminary results from the bleomycin model of lung fibrosis in the mouse were compelling, we are exploring alternative models that better represent senescence and fibrotic lung disease. We are also conducting studies that explore how the observed senolysis translates to a reduction in lung fibrosis. 
 Development Plan in Pulmonary Diseases 
 We intend to advance our lead development candidate, an inhaled administration senolytic molecule for pulmonary indications, into IND-enabling studies and, subject to the acceptance by the FDA of an IND for such candidate, into human clinical trials. While IPF is currently our lead indication, we are also exploring inhaled administration opportunities in other lung diseases, such as systemic sclerosis with pulmonary manifestations and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and in obstructive diseases such as COPD. 
 We expect our integrated pulmonary development plan will utilize patient safety data and pharmacological dose responses from the initial clinical study to accelerate the design of next-generation clinical studies in other pulmonary diseases. We expect that any Phase 1 program in any of these diseases would closely parallel our work in IPF and would take advantage of any learnings regarding pharmacokinetics following inhaled administration as well as biomarker and imaging responses. This approach should allow us to lay additional groundwork for a broader range of pulmonary diseases once we demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of inhaled senolytic administration. 
 Research and Discovery – Other Anti-Aging Programs
 We have secured our lead position in the discovery and development of senolytic medicines through our commitment to fundamental biological research and translational science. We have partnered with key academics and thought leaders to pursue areas of emerging aging science. We continue to recruit top-tier scientists with the desire and drive to understand, uncover, and invent. We invest a significant proportion of our resources and effort in emerging fields of aging science in order to transition fundamental scientific observations to the design and development of new therapeutics. We believe that we have built the internal research capabilities and scientific network to continue to be at the forefront of extending human healthspan. 
 24


Strategy for Systemically Administered Senolytic Medicines 
 In addition to our discovery and development of locally administered senolytic medicines for the treatment of local disease, we are similarly investigating the systemic administration of senolytic medicines for the treatment of senescent cell-driven disease within specific organs, tissues, and cell types. 
 Our first approach to systemic administration is to create a senolytic medicine that is designed to target a specific organ or even specific tissue within that organ. Such a senolytic medicine would selectively eliminate senescent cells within a tissue and reduce the SASP within that tissue. In considering therapeutic areas with unmet need and where there is strong evidence for the role of senescent cells driving disease, we are evaluating liver and kidney disease as well as neurological disorders.
 Our long-term goal is to use the principles that we establish for the design of systemically administered, targeted senolytic medicines to produce a pipeline of clinical candidates to eliminate senescent cells throughout the body. This could draw on ideas from immunology, senolytic viruses, vaccines, CAR-T type approaches or antibody drug conjugates. 
 Circulating Youth Factors (α-Klotho Protein) 
 We are also evaluating the administration of circulating youth factors in age-related diseases. Our lead discovery effort in circulating youth factors is focused on the α-Klotho protein. First discovered in 1997, the klotho gene was identified in mice as an “aging-suppressor” that accelerates aging when disrupted and extends lifespan when overexpressed. The α-Klotho protein is a circulating hormone primarily produced in the kidneys and choroid plexus of the brain and was recently discovered to delay and suppress the deleterious effects of aging on multiple organs, including the brain. Circulating levels of α-Klotho protein gradually decline with age and are implicated in chronic stress, cognitive impairment, and neurodegenerative disease.
 A small percentage of the population possesses naturally elevated α-Klotho levels as a result of the α-Klotho-VS heterozygous genetic variation. α-Klotho-VS heterozygosity is associated with extended healthspan, enhanced cognition, and less age-related cognitive decline. Elevated α-Klotho levels are also associated with greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume and improved connectivity between cortical regions, which in turn correlates with better executive function in normal aging humans. As this brain region is especially susceptible to shrinkage with age and vulnerable in several psychiatric and neurological disorders, its protection may provide clinical benefit in both normal aging and disease. 
 In 2014, Dena Dubal, of the University of California, San Francisco, and one of our scientific collaborators, first demonstrated that genetically elevated α-Klotho levels significantly enhance cognitive performance and neural resilience independent of age in normal and human amyloid precursor protein mouse models of neurodegenerative disease related to Alzheimer’s Disease. α-Klotho is hypothesized to optimize synaptic neurotransmission of NMDA receptors in the brain, effectively combatting the cognitive and synaptic deficits, despite high levels of pathogenic Ab, tau, and phosphorylated tau proteins associated with Alzheimer’s Disease.
 We are exploring the utility of α-Klotho protein in a variety of preclinical animal models, with the intention of identifying a drug candidate. 
 Manufacturing
 Our success as a company will depend on our ability to deliver reliable, high-quality preclinical and clinical drug supply. As we mature as a company and approach commercial stage operations, securing reliable high-quality commercial drug supply will be critical. We do not currently own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates. Because we rely on contract manufacturers, we employ personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical, and quality experience. Our staff has strong project management discipline to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. 
 25


Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulation that imposes various procedural and documentation requirements and that governs record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, and more. Our systems and our contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and compliance is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program. 
 Our current supply chains for our lead drug candidates involve several manufacturers that specialize in specific operations of the manufacturing process, specifically, raw materials manufacturing, drug substance manufacturing, and drug product manufacturing. We currently operate under purchase order programs for our drug candidates with Material Service Agreements in place, and we intend to establish long-term supply agreements in the future. We believe our current manufacturers have the scale, the systems, and the experience to supply all planned clinical studies. 
 We do not currently require commercial manufacturing capabilities. Should our needs change, we will likely need to scale up our manufacturing processes to enable commercial launch. To ensure continuity in our supply chain, we plan to establish supply arrangements with alternative larger scale suppliers for certain portions of our supply chain, as appropriate. 
 Commercialization Plan
 We do not currently have, nor do we expect to have in the near term, any FDA-approved drugs in our portfolio. Therefore, we have not yet built an infrastructure for sales, marketing, or commercial distribution. 
 Should any of our drug candidates be approved for commercialization, we intend to develop a plan to commercialize them in the U.S. and other key markets, through an internal infrastructure or external partnerships. 
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the field of research in aging, are typically rife with rapid technological developments, bold competition, and dependence on intellectual property. Like any biotechnology company, we face competition from multiple sources, including large or established pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and wellness companies, academic research institutions, government agencies, and private institutions. We believe our drug candidates will prevail amid the competitive landscape through their efficacy, safety, administration methods and convenience, cost, public and institutional demand, intellectual property portfolio, and treatment of the root cause of many age-related diseases. 
 We are aware of other companies seeking to develop treatments to prevent or treat aging-associated diseases through various biological pathways, including Calico, resTORbio and several other earlier-stage companies exploring cellular senescence. Calico has not yet disclosed any pipeline candidates or mechanisms of interest, and resTORbio is developing candidates targeting TORC1. Hence, we believe that we currently have the most advanced program addressing cellular senescence. 
 Our drug candidates are likely to compete against current therapies from a wide range of companies and technologies, including therapies for our lead indications: 
  
• | Musculoskeletal diseases, including osteoarthritis: current standard of care treatments (though not disease-modifying and focused on symptom management) include anti-inflammatory drugs (Ibruprofen, Diclofenac, Celecoxib), analgesic pain relief (Acetaminophen), or narcotic pain relief (Tramadol).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ophthalmology diseases, including diabetic retinopathy: potentially disease-modifying therapeutics are being sold and developed by several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Roche/Genentech and Regeneron.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pulmonary disease, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: therapeutics are being sold and developed by several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions, including Genentech, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Cytokinetics and Mallinckrodt, and are in various stages of clinical studies.

Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites, patient registration for clinical studies, and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, more tolerable, more convenient, or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our products’ entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety, and convenience of our drug candidates. 
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications that relate to our proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
Patent Portfolio 
 Our patent portfolio consists of a combination of issued and allowed patents and pending patent applications that are owned or co-owned by us and/or licensed or optioned to us from third parties. The majority of these patents and applications cover our cellular senescence program, and others pertain to our programs that target aging mechanisms beyond cellular senescence, including the administration of circulating youth factors and enhancement of mitochondrial health. As of March 2019, we own, co-own, or have an exclusive license or exclusive option to license in certain fields of use to more than 100 patents and pending applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. This portfolio includes 27 issued U.S. patents, 33 pending U.S. applications (including 13 provisional applications), and over 30 granted or pending applications in foreign jurisdictions. 
 Our cellular senescence patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications that are directed to our senolytic agents and programs, including our lead molecules UBX0101 and UBX1967, related molecules, and other compounds. We also have licensed the issued patents and patent applications covering the composition of matter and process manufacturing of UBX1967 under a license agreement with Ascentage Pharma Group Corp. Ltd., or Ascentage, as further described below. Our cellular senescence patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications directed to compositions of matter, use for treating age-related conditions, and methods of manufacture. 
 Our patent portfolio, including patents and applications that we have exclusively optioned, as well as those we own, co-own or have exclusively licensed, directed to our programs that target aging mechanisms beyond cellular senescence, including the administration of circulating youth factors and enhancement of mitochondrial health, includes four pending U.S. patent applications and six pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. 
 In general, patents have a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional priority date. Several of our issued U.S. and foreign patents that relate to UBX0101 and UBX1967 are scheduled to expire between approximately 2032 and 2037. The patent term may be extendible by up to five years in certain countries by means of patent term extension, depending on the regulatory pathway and the remaining term upon marketing approval. Certain other patents and patent applications directed to our cellular senescence patent portfolio, if they were to issue, may have later expiration dates.

 Other Anti-Aging Programs
We have an option to enter into an exclusive license with The Regents of the University of California for a patent family directed to methods of treatment and the use of klotho protein for the development of human therapeutics. Patent applications in this family are pending in the U.S. and six foreign jurisdictions. Future U.S. and foreign patents issued from this family are expected to expire in 2036, excluding any patent term adjustments and patent term extensions. 
 We also own one pending PCT application and co-own one U.S. provisional application with the Buck Institute on the enhancement of mitochondrial health. Future U.S. and foreign patents issued from these two patent families are expected to expire in 2038 and 2039, excluding any patent term adjustments and patent term extensions.
 Other Intellectual Property 
 Our continuing research and development, technical know-how, and contractual arrangements supplement our intellectual property protection to maintain our competitive position. Our policy is to require inventors who are identified on any Company-owned patent applications to assign rights to us. We also have confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and other advisors to protect our proprietary information. Our policy is to require third parties that receive material UNITY confidential information to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. 
 We also protect our brand through procurement of trademark rights. As of March 1, 2019, the mark UNITY BIOTECHNOLOGY® and the UNITY BIOTECHNOLOGY® design logo are registered in both the United States and the European Union. The mark UNITY® is also registered in the European Union. In order to supplement protection of our brand, we have also registered several internet domain names. 
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing, and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 29


U.S. Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 The process required by the FDA before drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical study may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy, or in the case of a biologic, the safety, purity and potency, of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the drug candidate is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical studies may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to commence. 
 Clinical Studies 
 Clinical studies involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practice regulations, or GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical study site’s IRB before the studies may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor 
 30


the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 
 The clinical investigation of a drug or biologic is generally divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. 
  
• | Phase 1. The drug or biologic is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug or biologic is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and preliminarily evaluate efficacy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug or biologic is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a drug candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but the FDA may accept results from Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust. 
 The FDA, the IRB or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to a substantial application user fee. Applications for orphan drug products are exempted from the NDA and BLA application user fees. 
 An NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 
 Once an NDA or BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 31


Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug or biologic to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions and typically follows such recommendations. 
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA or BLA 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical study(ies), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA or BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical studies. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review, that are intended to expedite the development and approval of new drugs and biologics that address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast-track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current. These six- and 10-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast-track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition 
 32


and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 
 Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for the other expedited review and approval programs, including accelerated approval, priority review, and fast-track designation. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs and biologics marketed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements. 
 Manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 33


 
• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs or BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product licenses or approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA or NDA application user fee. 
 A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, only a handful of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, although numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety 
 34


risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
 Hatch-Waxman Amendments and Exclusivity 
 Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. 
 Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method 
 35


of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. 
 The FDA also cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until all applicable non-patent exclusivities listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug have expired. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug containing an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic action. During that five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing (and therefore cannot approve) any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA that relies on the FDA’s approval of the drug, provided that that the FDA may accept an ANDA four years into the NCE exclusivity period if the ANDA applicant also files a Paragraph IV certification. 
 A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment. 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product 
 36


or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales. 
 Healthcare Reform
 In March 2010, former President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; requires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; requires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and imposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Licenses and Collaborations
 Description of Ascentage Agreements 
 In February 2016, we entered into several related agreements with Ascentage Pharma Group Corp Limited, or, Ascentage, based in Hong Kong, China. These agreements include (i) a compound library and option agreement, which includes a template form of license agreement, (ii) a license agreement covering an initial compound, APG1252, and (iii) a research services agreement.  In January 2019, we entered into another license agreement granting us development and commercialization rights to UBX1967 and the right to continue preclinical development efforts with another Ascentage-controlled Bcl-2 inhibitor compound.
Library Agreement and License Template 
 The compound library and option agreement, or library agreement, gives us access to Ascentage’s existing collection of Bcl-2 inhibitor compounds, as well as any additional Bcl-2 inhibitor compounds developed during the term of the library agreement, in order to screen such compounds for senolytic activity. The library agreement permits us to nominate up to 15 such compounds at any given time for further evaluation and subsequently to select up to five of such selected compounds for preclinical development and an additional five as back-up compounds.. Prior to commencing IND-enabling toxicology studies on an Ascentage compound of interest, we must formally designate the compound as a development candidate under the library agreement and enter into a separate license agreement with Ascentage covering that compound on the terms set forth in the template form of license agreement. The library agreement includes exclusivity provisions that (i) prohibit us from developing Ascentage Bcl-2 compounds for oncology indications, (ii) prohibit Ascentage from researching or developing certain Bcl-2 compounds for non-oncology indications under any circumstances, and (iii) prohibit Ascentage from researching or developing certain other Bcl-2 compounds for a specified set of non-oncology indications under certain circumstances. The term of the 
 37


library agreement is determined by a formula that is linked to the term of the research services agreement, with a maximum term of six years. The library agreement may be terminated by either party due to the other party’s uncured material breach of the library agreement. 
 Under the terms of the template form of license agreement, Ascentage will grant us the following rights with respect to a selected Ascentage compound for all non-oncology indications: (i) exclusive worldwide development rights, and (ii) exclusive commercialization rights outside of Greater China (China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). Inside Greater China, we will be obligated to commercialize the licensed Ascentage compound through a joint venture with Ascentage. Ascentage will also have the right to manufacture at least 50% of our supply requirements of the licensed compound, provided they achieve and maintain certain manufacturing quality standards. We will be obligated to make certain milestone payments in the form of shares of our common stock, subject to the equity cap described below, and other milestone payments in in the form of cash, not to exceed $38 million per licensed product, based in each case, upon the achievement of certain clinical and commercial milestones. We will also be required to make low-single digit royalty payments on net sales of the licensed product under the agreement. Our royalty payment obligations will expire on a country-by-country basis and licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the later to occur of (a) the expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering such licensed product in such country, (b) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such licensed product in such country, and (c) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in any country. We have the right to credit certain royalty payments that we pay to third parties with respect to certain licensed products against our royalty obligation to Ascentage. Any license agreement may be terminated by either party due to the other party’s uncured material breach of the agreement. 
 Under the library agreement, we issued 133,333 shares of our common stock as an upfront license fee. Of such shares, 80% were issued to Ascentage and 20% were issued to the University of Michigan in satisfaction of Ascentage’s obligation to pay a related sublicense fee to the University of Michigan. In addition to the shares issued pursuant to the APG1252 license agreement described below, we will also be obligated to issue an additional 133,333 shares of our common stock as an upfront license fee to Ascentage and the University of Michigan for each of the next two license agreements. The aggregate number of shares of our common stock we could be required to issue to Ascentage and the University of Michigan pursuant to the library agreement, the APG1252 license agreement, and any additional license agreements we enter into pursuant to the library agreement is capped at 1,333,338 shares. 
 APG1252 License Agreement 
 In conjunction with the library agreement, we entered into our first license agreement with Ascentage, which grants us the right to develop and commercialize an Ascentage compound known as APG1252 on the template license terms described above, including up to $38.0 million of potential cash milestone payments and low-single digit royalties. Under the APG1252 license agreement, Ascentage retains the right to manufacture APG1252 compounds for use in our licensed products. In connection with the APG1252 license agreement, we issued 533,335 shares of our common stock as an upfront license fee to Ascentage and the University of Michigan, in the proportion described above. The APG1252 license agreement may be terminated by either party due to the other party’s uncured material breach of the APG1252 license agreement, and we may terminate for convenience on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis. 
Research Agreement 
 In conjunction with the library agreement we also entered into a research services agreement with Ascentage under which we provide $500,000 per year in funding to Ascentage for the further development of Bcl-2 inhibitor compounds, which we retain the right to access under the library agreement. The research agreement has a term of up to four years from the effective date of February 2, 2016, provided that the research agreement may be terminated by us for convenience after the first year, by either party due to the other party’s uncured material breach, and by Ascentage if we fail to make the $500,000 payment in any given year. 
UBX1967 License Agreement 
 In January 2019, we entered into our second license agreement with Ascentage granting rights to UBX1967 (which Ascentage calls APG1197) on the template license terms described above, including up to $38.0 million of potential cash milestone payments and low-single digit royalties. Under the terms of this license agreement, Ascentage 
 38


has granted us exclusive development and commercialization rights and non-exclusive manufacturing rights to UBX1967 for all non-oncology indications outside of Greater China. Inside Greater China, we will be obligated to develop, manufacture and commercialize UBX1967 through a joint venture with Ascentage. The UBX1967 license agreement also grants us the right to continue our preclinical development efforts with another Ascentage-controlled Bcl-2 inhibitor compound.  In the event we wish to pursue clinical development of the additional compound as well as UBX1967, we will be required to enter into a separate license agreement with Ascentage on the template license terms described above. In connection with the UBX1967 license agreement, we will issue 106,666 shares of common stock to Ascentage and 26,667 shares if common stock to the University of Michigan as an upfront license fee in early 2019. The UBX1967 License Agreement may be terminated by either party due to an uncured material breach of the agreement but the other party, and we may terminate for convenience on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis.  
 Additional License Agreements 
 We are party to three additional license agreements that support our senescence-related patent portfolio. These agreements are with The John Hopkins University, or JHU, an entity affiliated with the Mayo Clinic, or Mayo, and the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, or Buck, and provide us with a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license under those counter-parties’ rights to a patent family that is co-owned by JHU, Buck, Mayo and us to develop and commercialize licensed products, including for the treatment of senescence-related diseases in therapeutic areas including osteoarthritis, ophthalmology, and pulmonary disease. 
 Under our November 2016 license with JHU, which relates to patents that are relevant only to osteoarthritis indications, we may be obligated to make development and sales milestone payments to JHU in the form of equity (22,033 shares of our common stock) and cash (of up to $2.6 million in the aggregate), to pay JHU a low-single digit percentage of certain sublicensing revenue, and to pay JHU a running royalty payment of less than 1% on net sales, in all cases, with respect to licensed products for the treatment of osteoarthritis, which we refer to as Royalty Products. Our obligation to pay running royalties to JHU under the agreement is subject to a non-material minimum annual royalty, and may continue on a country-by-country basis until such time as neither the manufacture, sale, or use of such Royalty Product would infringe a valid claim of a licensed patent in the applicable country. Our agreement with JHU continues on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent in such country (or until twenty years after the effective date if no licensed patent issues in such country). We may terminate the agreement for convenience (as a whole, with respect to a licensed product, or with respect to a particular licensed patent). Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy or insolvency-related events. 
 Under our June 2013 license with Mayo, we may be obligated to make development and sales milestone payments to Mayo of up to $10.8 million in the aggregate, to pay Mayo a percentage of certain sublicensing revenue that is between the high-single digits and the low-teens, and to pay Mayo running royalty payments ranging from less than 1% to low-single digit percentages on net sales of licensed products. Our obligation to pay running royalties to Mayo under the agreement is subject to a non-material minimum annual royalty and could potentially extend until January 1, 2037. We also issued 677,966 shares of our common stock to Mayo under this agreement. Our agreement with Mayo continues until the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim within the licensed patents and (ii) 13 years after first commercial sale of the first licensed product. We may terminate the agreement for convenience, and either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. 
 Under our January 2017 license with Buck, which includes similar rights to a second patent family that is co-owned only by Buck and us, we may be obligated to make development and sales milestone payments to Buck of up to $5.4 million in the aggregate, to pay Buck a mid-single digit percentage of certain sublicensing revenue, and to pay Buck running royalty payments ranging from less than 1% to low-single digit percentages on net sales of licensed products. Our obligation to pay running royalties to Buck under the agreement is subject to a non-material minimum annual royalty and could potentially extend until January 1, 2037. We also issued 132,203 shares of our common stock to Buck under this agreement. The term of our license agreement with Buck continues until the expiration of all our payment obligations to Buck thereunder. We may terminate the agreement for convenience, and either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach.

Employees
 As of March 1, 2019, we had 106 employees, all of whom were full-time. Greater than 65% of our employees hold advanced degrees. The majority of our employees work in our Brisbane, California, facility. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or a collective bargaining agreement. 
 40


Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Brisbane, California, where we currently lease approximately 39,000 square feet of office and laboratory space pursuant to a lease dated May 13, 2016. Although this facility is sufficient for our current needs, we will require additional space by the end of 2019 to accommodate our anticipated growth. Therefore, on February 28, 2019, we entered into a lease for a new facility which we anticipate will be ready for occupancy during the fourth quarter of 2019.  The new facility is located in South San Francisco, California, and is comprised of approximately 62,000 square feet of office and laboratory space.  The new lease has a term of 10 years from the lease commence date. Substantially all our employees work at our current facility and will also work at the new facility. 
Legal Proceedings
 We are not currently involved in any litigation or legal proceedings that, in management’s opinion, are likely to have any material adverse effect on our company. While we know of no imminent legal action in which we are likely to be involved, we may in the future become engaged in litigation or other legal proceedings. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact due to defense fees, settlement costs, demands on management attention, and other concerns.
