Overview
Payoneer is a financial technology company empowering the world’s small and medium-sized businesses (“SMB(s)”) to transact, do business and grow globally. Payoneer was founded in 2005 with the belief that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. It is our mission to enable anyone anywhere to participate and succeed in the global digital economy. In the 18 years since our founding, we have built a global financial platform that has already made it easier for millions of SMBs, particularly in emerging markets, to pay and get paid, manage their funds, and grow their business. 
Payoneer’s cross-border payment solutions makes it easier for SMBs to pay and get paid quickly, reliably, and cost-effectively, regardless of where they do business. Our core value proposition for customers is the Payoneer Account, which is a secure, regulated payment infrastructure platform that offers a global, multi-currency account to businesses of any size from almost every country. 
Payoneer serves SMBs worldwide in a wide variety of industries. They are exporters selling goods cross-border to consumers and businesses, freelancers and businesses capitalizing on the digitization of the workplace and remote work, services companies exporting their capability to international clients, vacation rental hosts reopening after the pandemic, and digital creators delivering their content to customers around the world and more. Given the diverse nature of Payoneer’s customers and their businesses, our revenues experience seasonal fluctuations as a result of consumer and businesses spending patterns. 
Our SMB customers have similar financial needs to larger companies, including the need to find customers, manage their business, get paid quickly and reliably and make cost-effective payments everywhere they do business, manage their supply chain, identify new growth opportunities, access capital, and manage risk. Payoneer provides a broad range of services to enable SMBs to more easily build, manage, and grow their business globally.
We built a financial network for the future of global trade which spans more than 190 countries and territories. In 2022, Payoneer supported transactions in over 7,000 unique trade corridors and enabled local settlement in more than 100 countries. Our global platform is built on bank-grade security, stability and redundancy. Our ability to reach and serve customers at scale is supported by our modern technology infrastructure, our ability to offer a broad product suite, a global operations team, and data and machine learning capabilities.
We have also built a meaningful brand in the global digital commerce ecosystem. This awareness allows us greater leverage with our marketing efforts. The majority of new customers that sign up to Payoneer come organically to our website, and we get many additional customers from customer referrals and via our partners. This reduces our cost of customer acquisition, improving the efficiency of our sales and marketing efforts. In addition, we have sales teams based in key market hubs around the world, host dozens of virtual and physical events annually that attract tens of thousands of businesses to help them connect and learn about new growth opportunities, and market online in targeted channels. 
We have grown rapidly since our founding. In the year ended December 31, 2022, our volume and revenue grew by 8% and 33%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Volume was $61.3 billion and $56.7 billion and revenue was $627.6 million and $473.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Global Trends: A Changing World Drives Unmet Needs and Opportunity
Since our founding, we have focused our efforts on several powerful secular trends that are creating significant opportunities for new types of services and service providers.
Digitalization is Accelerating
More people and businesses are engaging a greater amount of their activities online than ever before, driving the rapid growth of digital commerce for businesses and consumers all over the world. Business-to business (“B2B”) digital commerce is even bigger than 

4



retail eCommerce and according to third-party research has grown even more quickly than consumer eCommerce, with B2B digital commerce industry volume expected to be $42.7 trillion by 2026.
Cross-border Commerce is a Substantial and Growing Portion of Digital Commerce
The growth of digitalization has also eased the ability for people and businesses in different places around the world to communicate, interact and transact. As a result, we have seen dramatic growth of cross-border activity of many types, including content consumption, communication, and commerce. This growth in cross-border commerce is changing the way people buy and sell and increasing the opportunity and need for new payment and commerce-enabling solutions to support cross-border trading businesses. 
At the same time however, global businesses routinely have to deal with local requirements in each of the markets with which they trade, requiring them to manage multiple strategic banking relationships globally and resulting in increased cost and delay. Establishing a banking relationship in each market, for example, is often hard to achieve, very time consuming and difficult to complete remotely, requiring meaningful investment. For digital businesses that operate online, it is difficult to find one partner that can help them cover the globe. To optimize their global business, digital merchants have needed to work with and manage multiple partners that are optimized for each region in which they sell.
Emerging Markets are Driving Global Economic Growth
Emerging markets account for half of global GDP and 2/3 of global GDP growth over the past decade. Emerging markets are home to more than half of the world’s population and have a median age of 34. Constrained by limited local markets and resources, many of these SMBs are digitally native and global from inception. Many markets have leapfrogged their developed economy counterparts on the export stage. 
Despite their digital maturity, many SMBs doing business in these emerging markets have access to only the most basic services offered by their local financial institutions. Global banking and payment services mostly remain out of reach, forcing emerging market SMBs to seek alternative methods of payment. Payoneer taps into the growth opportunity of these markets by enabling the SMBs in these markets to do business globally.
Marketplaces and Platform Ecosystems are Growing Rapidly
A key driver and beneficiary of these trends is the emergence of marketplaces and platforms as aggregators of digital commerce. They bring together large numbers of buyers and sellers from a wide range of geographies and across a variety of categories, including eCommerce, B2B, digital services, remote work, travel customer base, content creation, gaming, e-learning, accounting services and more. 
Marketplaces and platforms represented over 67% of consumer digital commerce in 2021, up from 62% in 2020, growing faster than digital commerce in general. The marketplace business model has become very global and Payoneer now works with marketplaces and platforms in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and North America. We support these marketplaces in their relationships with sellers of goods, services, content, vacation rentals and more from over 190 countries and territories around the world. Our view across multiple marketplaces also allows us to identify industry-wide bad actors and cancel their account across the entire ecommerce ecosystem. This can help stop both active fraud and prevent future fraud on unsuspecting platforms.
As sellers gain scale and expertise on these marketplaces, they are also looking to invest in building their own brand to diversify their business and sell omnichannel. These SMBs want to grow beyond the marketplace ecosystems through direct-to-consumer webstore sales.
Global Regulatory and Compliance Requirements are Constantly Evolving 
Global cross-border payments are a highly regulated industry and continuous changes in the regulatory and compliance landscape means scale, expertise, and technology are critical to doing business successfully. Most traditional financial institutions and even modern fintech companies lack experience in emerging markets and the ability to manage scaled customer onboarding and risk management to cover the world. This presents a significant competitive advantage for Payoneer.

5



For example, to manage a global base of sellers requires a marketplace to implement a compliance program, address challenges of money laundering and terrorist financing and deal with complex risk management challenges. As a result, many marketplaces have historically limited the number of cross-border sellers and the number of countries from which sellers can join. There are few solutions available to deal with these challenges on a multi-national basis, and the solutions that have begun to emerge are neither comprehensive nor uniform in their geographic coverage or quality. This creates challenges for financial institutions and other companies that look to serve these global platforms. Payoneer has built robust compliance infrastructure and has nearly two decades of experience navigating the risk challenges associated with cross-border payments, particularly into emerging markets.
The Payoneer Account for SMBs
Payments are at the heart of commerce and are the foundation of our ecosystem. Many of our customers interact in networks where both parties are Payoneer customers and by operating together on the Payoneer platform they are able to transact seamlessly, in real-time. Every payment a business accepts or makes also creates an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of their business. We use these data insights to build additional services, which in turn accelerate commercial activity, increase volume, bring more customers into our network, and further strengthen our ecosystem. The power of the Payoneer platform emanates from the following components:
Platform that Enables Global B2B
The Payoneer platform is built to serve businesses of all sizes and be a true enabler of global B2B commerce. The opportunity is vast with B2B commerce representing a larger market than consumer commerce globally. Our platform can onboard businesses of all sizes from over 190 countries and territories and provides them access to financial services that are frictionless, interconnected and natively global and digital.
Our customers use their Payoneer Account to collect funds from all over the world, with sources including large marketplaces, trading partners, corporate buyers and other small firms. They use Payoneer to manage their funds in the currencies they want and need, and move their money where it needs to go. They can send funds to their local bank account, pay for expenses using our Commercial Mastercard, make payments through our In-Network ecosystem, and pay suppliers. They can also access working capital from Payoneer to invest for growth. 
Drive Growth Through Modern Technology and Global Reach
Payoneer delivers technology-based services to our customers through a proprietary modern technology infrastructure that includes robust and secure application programming interfaces (“APIs”) as well as web and mobile applications and machine learning infrastructure. Our platform supports millions of transactions and hundreds of thousands of new applicants monthly and tens of billions of dollars of volume annually. We build and maintain most of the systems we use to deliver service to our customers, including our customer-facing systems, back-office systems, risks management and compliance systems. We also rely on a wide range of third-party systems for specialized capabilities, which are integrated into our proprietary platform. We continuously make significant investments in cybersecurity infrastructure and processes to protect our systems and data from breaches.
Trusted Brand Supported by Local Teams
Payoneer’s customers come from over 190 countries and territories. To effectively serve this global customer base, we have teams in developed and emerging markets, including primary hubs in the US, Israel, Hong Kong, Philippines and China that provide operational support. These teams provide around the clock customer care in dozens of languages across multiple channels (mobile, online, chat, email, phone and social media). Our broad range of support includes customer care, account management, customer approvals, payment review and approvals, risk management, card operations, customer implementations and configuration management. In addition, we have extensive infrastructure to support our enterprise accounts in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, we are able to provide global coverage for our customers, ensuring no matter where they come from or where they do business, we can help make global business local for them.
In 2022, Payoneer returned to hosting face-to-face customer events in many key markets worldwide, including a seven-city roadshow through India. These events gave us the opportunity to meet with and build deeper relations with thousands of SMBs. These events are geared towards growing businesses that are looking to learn new ways to expand and get connected to our ecosystem of partners. We create unique content, combining our data, customer surveys and expert analysis to emphasize trust, empowerment,

partnership and connection to the world. We reinforce this commitment with our global and local teams that provide support and produce resources that focus on addressing key questions, opportunities, and challenges for our customers.
Data Creates Competitive Advantages and Delivers Value to Customers
We have built machine-learning models leveraging the data that we collect in the ordinary course of our operations and services in a manner compliant with applicable privacy and data protection rules and regulations. These models enable us to make informed predictions to better serve our customers’ needs. For instance, we apply our machine-learning models in key areas such as lifetime value assessment, risk management and working capital underwriting. Utilizing these unique data insights, we are able to offer new valuable solutions, drive growth and improve our profitability. We believe this data has a virtuous cycle and can create a sustainable advantage as these insights enable us to do more business in a better way, which then provides even more data that we can use to refine and enhance our capabilities and performance.
Robust and Scalable Compliance, Risk & Regulatory Infrastructure
We implement a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering/Combatting Terrorist Financing (AML/CTF) and Sanctions Program in compliance with the laws of the jurisdictions where Payoneer is regulated. Through our AML/CTF program we manage the compliant onboarding and ongoing monitoring of our customers, who come from more than 190 countries and territories worldwide. Our Know Your Customer (KYC) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) processes are managed through a proprietary infrastructure and dedicated team, combining automated tools and operational processes with regular audits and reviews to test and monitor for compliance. We have also built a sophisticated risk management infrastructure to address the risks of digital commerce and a global risk management platform to manage the risks of supporting billions of dollars of volume in over 7,000 trade corridors globally for millions of platform participants. As of December 31, 2022, we are in good standing in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world.
We are regulated as a non-bank financial institution in key markets around the world, namely the United States, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan and Australia. In the United States, we are registered as a Money Service Business and are licensed as a Money Transmitter in all U.S. states in which such licenses are necessary and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We also have regulatory authorizations in India, where we act as an Online Payment Gateway Service Provider, approved by the Reserve Bank of India. Payoneer Europe Limited is an authorized e-money institution in Ireland covering the European Economic Area (EEA) and serving the United Kingdom until the end of its temporary permission to do so and holds a license with Mastercard to issue cards. Payoneer Payment Services UK Ltd is an Electronic Money Institution authorized by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and will start serving the United Kingdom prior to the end of Payoneer Europe Limited’s temporary permission. Payoneer Hong Kong Limited is a licensed Money Services Operator with the Customs and Excise Department in Hong Kong. Payoneer Japan Limited is a Registered Fund Transfer Service Provider with the Kanto Finance Bureau in Japan. Payoneer Australia Pty Limited is licensed by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission to deal in non-cash payment products. Payoneer terms and conditions are provided to our customers from one or more of our regulated entities, each of which is obligated to implement compliance programs, protect customer funds and meet the other regulatory obligations under the supervision and oversight of the local regulators.
Sophisticated Global Banking and Treasury Infrastructure
With customers coming from and doing business all over the world, Payoneer has invested significantly in building a proprietary global banking infrastructure. We work with more than 80 banks and payment providers and are connected into well over 100 local clearing systems through which we can deliver payments locally to customers, in exact amounts, in their local currency. We have invested heavily in innovative and reliable systems, including our smart routing platform and a global treasury team, which automates global payment routing while ensuring that we maintain an appropriate amount of money in the right jurisdictions to support anticipated transaction activity. In addition, we focus on redundancy in our global infrastructure, providing us with multiple ways to settle with customers.

Product, Solutions and Technology
As digital commerce becomes more pervasive and more global, we find our customers expressing a need for an increasingly broad range of services to enable them to grow, address their challenges and capitalize on their opportunities. 
Since our founding, we have been building and extending our platform, working collaboratively with enterprises and SMBs that have been at the forefront of digital commerce. The result is a unique global platform built for modern digital business, able to support a wide range of customers and meet their vast and growing needs.
​
Global Marketplace Payments
Payoneer provides marketplaces and other enterprises with Mass Payout services via APIs and online application. These Mass Payout services enable enterprises to pay sellers across the world with a broad set of localized payment methods including local bank payments, international wires, mobile wallets, physical and virtual cards and paper checks, and enable them to pay in local currencies and directly into bank accounts.
​
B2B Accounts Payable / Accounts Receivable (AP/AR) Services
Payoneer offers B2B AP/AR services to enable SMBs the ability to pay and get paid by their trading partners around the world quickly, locally and cost-effectively. These include enabling SMBs to pay their suppliers one by one or in bulk, create and manage invoices, bill customers in multiple currencies, and enable buyers to pay with convenient local or global payment methods, regardless of where the seller comes from.
Global Multi-Currency Account
The core Global Multi-Currency Payoneer Account enables SMBs to receive payments in multiple currencies. Our SMB customers can receive funds from marketplaces, buyers, trading partners and more. They can accept payments locally in the country where their buyer is located in the buyer’s local currency. Once the funds are in the Global Multi-Currency Account, they are available to the customer in the currency in which they were originally received and free to use as the customer decides, including repatriating to their home market, withdrawing into a local bank account or paying their suppliers. Many of our customers find significant value in the ability to hold and transact in multiple currencies, particularly if they are doing business from countries or regions that face significant macro uncertainties and/or currency fluctuations.
Physical & Virtual Commercial Cards
Payoneer SMB customers can use physical or virtual cards to access the balances in their Payoneer Account. Some of our customers use physical cards to access their funds through local ATM networks, make purchases online and in-store at local businesses or pay business expenses. Our Digital Purchasing Card, launched in late 2020 in partnership with Mastercard, is a virtual commercial card product designed for our customers to make purchases for their key expenses.
Working Capital
Payoneer has introduced services to provide SMBs with access to working capital with amounts advanced ranging from $50 to more than $1 million. We leverage machine learning models and underwriting processes that enable us to effectively manage risk while providing a valuable service to our customers. We fund these obligations through a mix of balance sheet cash and warehouse financing facilities.
Merchant Services
Payoneer Checkout is a new offering that enables SMBs to accept payments on their webstores from buyers globally. Funds are consolidated in their Payoneer Multi-Currency Account, enabling SMB customers to unify their business across sales channels and better track all their global sales activities. The product went live in Hong Kong and is expected to be rolled out to additional regions in 2023.

Tax Services
We offer several Tax Services to empower our customers to better automate the management of their tax obligations, including the ability to collect US tax forms, manage withholding and pay VAT obligations in several foreign markets.
​
Compliance & Risk Services
We offer services that enable digital enterprises to make payments to their customers without having the need to be regulated themselves. These digital enterprises offload the compliance and regulatory burden, which reduces their operating costs and allows them to focus on their core business.
Growth Solutions - Green Channel
Green Channel is a matching and onboarding program designed to connect marketplaces with top merchants that have been pre-screened by our robust fraud prevention and compliance capabilities. The service empowers marketplaces to grow their inventory rapidly by bringing on high-quality cross-border sellers, while also helping those sellers to expand into new markets quickly and seamlessly, creating a trusted ecosystem for cross-border business.
ERP and Partner Integrations
As a technology-driven platform, Payoneer integrates with a wide range of partners to extend the Payoneer ecosystem and deliver more value to our customers. We use APIs to integrate with a wide variety of partners across categories that include accounting software providers, ERP systems, logistics companies, sourcing platforms, mobile wallets, advertising platforms, marketplaces and more. These APIs integrations and partnerships enable us to provide a range of important functionality including:

● | integrating Payoneer into the systems our customers use to operate their businesses, allowing them to see their transaction data and order management data in one place;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
●enabling partners to provide us with supplemental data to use for underwriting working capital;
​

● | facilitating our partners to debit the balances of Payoneer customers to make purchases or to settle into their bank accounts; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
●initiating invoicing or payments through Payoneer from accounting software systems.
​
Payoneer for Banks
Payoneer for Banks enables banks, mobile wallets, neobanks and other providers of financial services to SMBs to partner with Payoneer. Through Payoneer for Banks, partners on four continents now offer their customers the ability to sign up for Payoneer and access their Payoneer Global Multi-Currency Account through their online account or mobile app and to settle funds in near-real time from Payoneer directly into their local bank account. Payoneer for Banks partners integrate Payoneer APIs to embed Payoneer services into their technology.
Our Growth Strategy
Payoneer is solving key customer needs through our differentiated product offering and platform, and we are well positioned to capture significant growth opportunities from long-term secular trends. We intend to drive continued growth by focusing on a few key areas:
Leverage Market Momentum and Scale
We see exciting opportunities to continue to grow B2B AP/AR, as well as in marketplace ecosystems, with both marketplaces and marketplace sellers. These represent large market opportunities with strong growth trends, in which we believe Payoneer has competitive advantages that position us to continue to grow for years to come. These are also businesses of a large enough scale that we expect these will be the primary drivers of volume and revenue growth for Payoneer in the near term.

Scale B2B AP/AR Services - We believe that we are in the very early stages of building our B2B AP/AR business and that there are many growth opportunities ahead. To enable these opportunities, we have integrated B2B AP/AR into our global SMB sales efforts and are securing relationships with larger sellers. We have also created APIs that enable partners to integrate the B2B AP/AR services into their SaaS offerings for their customers; we continue to add more ways for buyers to pay and sellers to get paid like global wires and open banking in Europe; and we continue to improve customer experience and risk management. There are important network effects on the B2B AP/AR services. These network effects contribute to Payoneer’s low cost of customer acquisition and positive volume retention, as network effects create stickiness that keep customers on our platform.
Marketplace Ecosystems - We see many opportunities to continue to grow as a key partner for marketplaces and SMB marketplace sellers around the world. Our growth strategy for marketplace ecosystems leverages our unique global footprint, network of SMBs, compliance and risk capabilities. These are growth-enabling tools that allow us to (i) increase volume with our existing marketplaces as those ecosystems continue to grow; (ii) secure relationships with additional marketplaces, including social and other consumer internet platforms that have announced their intention to become marketplaces, which further grows volume and provides additional channels for Payoneer’s SMBs to grow; (iii) expand to new categories; (iv) help consumer platforms scale up their eCommerce capabilities by introducing SMB relationships through our Green Channel program; and (v) expand the range of services we provide to marketplaces.
Expand Partnership Ecosystems
As a global platform that has attracted millions of customers around the world, we have been building momentum with many different types of partners that deliver more value and improved customer experience for Payoneer customers and accelerate cost-effective acquisition of new customers. We have partnered with SaaS platforms, mobile wallets, banks, marketplaces, advertising platforms, accounting firms, logistics companies and sourcing platforms, among others. These partnerships cover a broad range of activities, including collaborating with marketplaces and SaaS platforms to offer Working Capital to SMBs; working with a leading sourcing platform to enable customers to source goods directly through their Payoneer Account; partnering with a global bank to leverage our merchant services platform to secure important new customer relationships; and collaborating with a leading SMB accounting software platform to offer integrated services.
​
Product Extension to Deliver More Value to Existing Customers and Target New Customers
We are making meaningful investments in additional growth opportunities that we believe will deliver significant value to our existing customers and also enable Payoneer to target large pools of new customers around the world. Three nascent growth opportunities we are actively investing in are Merchant Services, Working Capital and Commercial Cards. Each of these represents a very large market opportunity and we believe we are well-positioned to leverage our global platform, brand, sales teams, compliance and risk capabilities and more to scale these and deliver unique value to customers. While we expect these to collectively consume meaningful investment dollars over the next few years, they are an important part of how we will continue to scale our global platform and revenues over the next several years. These new services are expected to help us to further accelerate our payback period for new customers and drive more value per customer.
Pursue Strategic M&A
Following our acquisition of optile GmbH (now, Payoneer Germany GmbH) (“optile”) in 2020, we believe there are many more opportunities to leverage our global platform, regulatory and compliance infrastructure, technology, brand and team to deliver additional value to more customers more quickly if we supplement our organic product development with targeted acquisitions that add new capabilities or drive greater efficiency to our platform. In addition, we have a large SMB customer base that maintains long-term relationships with Payoneer, which offers us the opportunity to acquire companies with synergistic product offerings for our customers. We have built a team to lead our efforts to identify strategic growth opportunities that we believe are best suited to pursue through acquisition.
Competition
Payoneer operates in very large markets with a very broad set of competition. The most common competition for Payoneer are checks and wires, which are still the most used methods of B2B payments. The universe of competition includes payment methods like checks, wires, mobile wallets, network-branded physical and virtual cards, local clearing providers, open banking services and alternative payment methods.

10



There are also myriad types of payment providers that offer global payment services including global treasury banks that serve large corporate accounts; small local banks that focus on serving local SMBs; FX companies that focus on serving SMB importers and exporters; global digital payment platforms like PayPal, Ant Group, or Wise; global card networks; Neobanks; SMB-focused B2B payment providers like Bill.com; mass payout service providers that specialize at providing services to enterprises and marketplaces, SMB AP/AR SaaS providers; merchant service providers that sell services to marketplaces like Adyen, Braintree and Stripe; and local companies that focus on enabling SMBs in one or more local markets to sell on digital marketplaces globally. For example, in China we face competition from a number of local payment providers. In some cases, marketplaces will provide their own payment capabilities to support payments to sellers.
While competitive factors and their relative importance can vary based on the size, the industry and the geographic reach of our partners and merchants, we believe we compete primarily on the basis of the quality and functionality of our platform, customer service, data security, pricing and innovation. We believe we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors.
Regulation
Payments Regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and globally. Payoneer is licensed in multiple jurisdictions and serves customers in over 190 countries and territories worldwide, from such licensed locations. Payoneer Inc. is a Money Service Business registered with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Payoneer Inc. is a licensed money transmitter under the laws of all U.S. states where such license is necessary, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The Money Transmitter license for Nevada is held by Payoneer US LLC, a subsidiary of Payoneer Inc. due to Nevada’s requirements. These licenses support the full range of Payoneer Account and Mass Payout payment services and among other activities, subject us to reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds and inspection by state regulatory agencies.
Outside the U.S., we provide localized versions of our services to customers through various foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate and under which they are licensed to provide services. For example, in Europe we are licensed in Ireland by the Central Bank of Ireland (authorized pursuant to EU passporting rules to provide payment services under its license in all countries in the European Economic Area). These regulatory authorities include, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission in Australia, the Customs and Excise Department in Hong Kong, the Kanto Finance Bureau in Japan, and the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom. Payoneer Inc. also acts as an Online Payment Gateway Service Provider (OPGSP) approved by the Reserve Bank of India, for the purpose of facilitating the collection of cross-border payments for Indian residents. This list is not exhaustive, as there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction. The laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change.
Numerous laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and internationally. Various aspects of our business are, may become, or may be viewed by regulators from time to time as subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. As a cross-border digital payment platform, our business includes the facilitation, through our global bank and partner network, of the acceptance and/or payout of funds. As such, we are subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including (but not limited to) those governing payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), stored value, cross-border and domestic money transmission, factoring, foreign exchange, banking secrecy, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations.
Where we do not have an operational licensed subsidiary, Payoneer typically relies on locally-licensed or regulated banks and payment partners to facilitate transactions in certain jurisdictions where Payoneer is not locally regulated. In certain of these jurisdictions, Payoneer maintains its own bank accounts or a pool of funds with a local partner.
For customers that come from China, Payoneer operates by providing the offshore/non-resident part of the service being provided under the regulatory framework of Payoneer Inc. and the settlement leg in China being supported by entities regulated by the People’s Bank of China (“PBOC”) that are Payoneer partners, such as banks and payment service providers. As of now, there is no specific date or deadline to require foreign and/or Chinese payment service providers partnering with foreign payment service providers to change their service framework or obtain a local license.
We are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to businesses in general, such as those relating to employment, consumer protection, worker confidentiality obligations and taxation. As an online business, we are also subject to laws and regulations 

11



governing the internet, such as those relating to intellectual property ownership and infringement, trade secrets, the distribution of electronic communications, search engines and internet tracking technologies, and could be affected by potential changes to laws and regulations that affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including with respect to net neutrality and taxation on the use of the internet or eCommerce transactions.
Compliance with KYC Requirements. Payoneer Inc. and other licensed entities of Payoneer are committed to compliance with all applicable customer identification regulatory requirements. We are committed to preventing the use of our financial products by persons who seek to launder the proceeds of criminal activity, finance terrorism, or conduct other criminal acts. The risk of abuse is presented in large part through customers. Payoneer makes reasonable efforts appropriate to the circumstances to know its customers. Therefore, Payoneer has adopted a “Know Your Customer” (“KYC”) program to assist in managing its Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorism Financing (“AML/CTF”) risk.
The KYC program is a critical component of the AML/CTF Program. KYC embodies the concept that, in order to identify what is unusual activity for a customer, one must have established a sufficient understanding of what is usual and expected activity, consistent with the purpose and intended usage of the account relationship. Activity that is outside the norm or inconsistent with an institution’s understanding may be suspicious and require reporting to authorities.
Payoneer’s KYC program includes: (i) policies and procedures for collecting and verifying information on the identity of customers; (ii) policies and procedures for gathering further information about customers to gain a better understanding of the relationship and anticipated transaction activity; and (iii) policies and procedures for monitoring customer activity throughout the lifecycle of the relationship.
Our Customer Approval Policy is informed by our AML/CTF Risk Assessment, which determines the level of AML/CTF risk posed to Payoneer by its product offerings, customer base, business geographies, distribution channels, and technologies, as well as the effectiveness of Payoneer’s compliance-related controls, policies, and procedures in mitigating these risks. Such risks stem from applicable legal/regulatory requirements, the nature of Payoneer products/services (including features, customers and geographic reach) and the record of actual performance of the Payoneer AML/CTF compliance program. These risks are mitigated, among other controls, by the KYC controls and requirements outlined in this document.
This Customer Approval Policy constitutes an integral part of Payoneer’s AML/CTF program and outlines our responsibilities with respect to applicable KYC requirements as detailed in pertinent US laws, regulations, and statutes, including the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), the USA PATRIOT Act, and in the relevant laws, regulations, and statutes of jurisdictions where Payoneer holds a local license.
Data Protection & Privacy Regulations: As a company operating a global cross-border digital payment platform, we collect, process, store, share, disclose, transfer, retain and/or use personal information and other data in connection with conducting our business, including for purposes of marketing our services and products via the phone, email and text messages and verifying the identity of individuals within the framework of our know your customer (KYC) processes, which processes are required as part of our robust, risk-based compliance program that addresses the regulatory requirements of each country involved in a cross-border payment on our platform. Consequently, our business is subject globally to a number of complex laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, including with respect to such collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, transfer, retention and use of personal information and other data.
The data privacy and security laws and regulations to which our business is subject may apply to personal information and data concerning our customers, employees or other third parties who interact with us, and include the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended, including by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 and the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations), the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the CAN-SPAM Act, Canada Anti-Spam Law, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the European Union’s Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), or the GDPR, and other laws, enactments, regulations or orders transposing, implementing, adopting, supplementing or derogating from, the GDPR in each European Economic Area Member State, including the Irish Data Protection Act 2018, the European e-Privacy Directive currently implemented through national European laws in connection with the respect for private life and the protection of personal data in electronic communications (which is expected to be replaced by the European e-Privacy Regulation, which is still under development), GDPR as transposed into the United Kingdom national law by operation of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and as amended by the Data Protection,

Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, together with the Data Protection Act 2018, the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (as amended) and other data protection or privacy legislation in force from time to time in the United Kingdom, the Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China and Personal Information Protection Law of the People's Republic of China, Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD), the Australian Privacy Act of 1988 and Japan’s Act on the Protection of Personal Information. These laws and their implementing regulations generally restrict certain collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information. These laws also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information and may impose obligations to provide notification of security breaches affecting personal information.
The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or by new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require us, from time to time, to modify our data processing practices, agreements and policies and to incur substantial costs in order to comply with this ever-evolving regulatory landscape. We implement a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other measures to protect the data we process, including data pertaining to our customers, employees and business partners, but despite the measures we put in place, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to such data.
Additionally, such laws and regulations may be inconsistent across jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. The applicability of these laws and regulations to us, and their scope and interpretation, are often uncertain, particularly with respect to laws and regulations outside the United States. Because the laws and regulations governing payment services and data privacy and security are constantly evolving and striving to keep pace with innovations in technology and media, it is possible that we may need to materially alter the way we conduct some parts of our business activities or we may be prohibited from conducting such activities altogether at some point in the future. For additional information regarding some of the risks relating to data privacy and security, see “Risk factors - Regulatory Risks Related to Payoneer - Our business is subject to complex and evolving regulations and oversight, in relation to privacy and data protection. Failure to comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations could subject us to fines and reputational harm.”
Human Capital
We are a company for entrepreneurs built by entrepreneurs. The people who work at Payoneer define Payoneer and enable our customers to participate in the global economy. As of December 31, 2022, our workforce consisted of 2,336 people in 41 locations across 36 countries. Our team draws from 63 nationalities, with a broad spectrum of backgrounds and experiences, across technology, financial services and other areas. We foster an entrepreneurial culture so that we may remain focused and innovative over time to ensure success as a trusted partner to our customers.
Our Global Team, Culture and Values 
We believe the employees and culture of Payoneer are critical to our success and our ability to grow our business, support our customers and deliver shareholder value. We celebrate diversity and the cultures of the world represented by our customers and employees. Our goal is to create an environment in which each employee feels comfortable being exactly who they are, where they are connected to something bigger than themselves and are given the support and opportunity to be the best they can be. We foster an environment that is defined by tolerance and caring for our fellow employees and our customers.
We aim to maintain a long-term, balanced approach to decision-making, and believe that what is good for our employees will be good for our customers and for our shareholders.
We believe our commitment to a core set of values cultivates a unique culture and a sustainable competitive advantage. The following six core values permeate every part of Payoneer, including our people, our platform and our business:
Inclusion: We go beyond borders. We believe that everyone, regardless of location and culture, deserves an equal opportunity to succeed and that the world is richer thanks to diversity.
Action: We go beyond limits. We are creative problem solvers with a bias in favor of taking action. We do not let anything get in the way of going the extra mile to bring value to our customers.

Passion: We go beyond care. We aim to make a positive impact in the lives of our customers by partnering with them to identify and meet their business needs and continually exceed expectations.
Excellence: We go beyond the expected. We boldly strive to maintain consistency in delivering a superior experience and service and remind ourselves that we can always do more for our customers.
Transparency: We go beyond trust. We value integrity and honesty and are working constantly to encourage open communication both within our teams and with our customers.
Humility: We go beyond assumptions. We acknowledge that we are only here thanks to our customers and are inspired by their entrepreneurial spirit. We are a global team that care for and respect one another and share a strong sense of responsibility to serve our customers. 
These values are central to Payoneer and not only form the basis for how we recruit and evaluate performance, but also demonstrate how we are able to harness the collective talent of our employees and empower our partners around the world.
Employee Wellness
Our employees are our most valuable strength at Payoneer so we invest heavily in attracting and retaining our talented employees. We are highly focused on the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees, providing them with access to a wide-reaching support network that prioritizes both physical and mental health and wellness. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and 2021, our internal policies have put employee welfare far ahead of any other considerations. We provide hybrid working flexibility, offering a safe office environment in compliance with relevant local regulations. 
Total rewards
Payoneer is a people-centric company that rewards employees for our shared success. From a total rewards perspective, Payoneer offers a compensation and benefits package that is scalable, sustainable and equitable. The principle behind our total rewards approach is to attract, retain and engage top talent in a manner that will drive desired behaviors and increase business performance while nurturing the wellbeing of our employees and their families. In so doing, we have built a pay for performance rewards strategy and also a governed framework that measures and monitors total rewards expenses in a fiscally responsible manner. Our annual compensation planning takes place right after our year-end performance review process where employees and managers share feedback to facilitate professional and career development and set professional and development goals for the year to come, and make performance-based rewards decisions.
Intellectual Property
The protection of our intellectual property rights is an important aspect of our business, and substantially all of our material intellectual property rights are currently developed in-house. We rely on a combination of trade secrets and know-how, trademark and copyright laws, confidentiality agreements, and technical measures to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights and technology, including our brand and platform. We have registered our brand name as a trademark and domain names, in each case, in the United States and a number of other jurisdictions. We do not have any issued patents.
We consider our digital payment platform, which provides payment, financial, merchant, working capital and other services to companies, marketplaces, eCommerce sellers and others, to be our proprietary technology. The development and management of our platform require sophisticated coordination among many specialized employees. We believe that duplication of this coordination by competitors or individuals seeking to copy our platform would be difficult. To protect our technology and our platform, we implement multiple layers of security and provide our service offerings from duplicate data centers in two jurisdictions.
We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and enter into confidentiality agreements with third parties to control access to, and the use and disclosure of, our confidential information. However, our contractual provisions may not always be effective at preventing unauthorized parties from obtaining our intellectual property rights and proprietary technologies or disclosing our confidential information. Likewise, intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property or proprietary rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated. For additional information regarding some of the risks relating to our intellectual property rights, see “Risk factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.”
