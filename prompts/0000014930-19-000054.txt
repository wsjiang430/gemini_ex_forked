Item 1. Business
Brunswick Corporation is a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 31, 1907. We are a leading global designer, manufacturer, and marketer of recreation products including marine engines, boats, fitness equipment, and active recreation products. Our engine-related products include: outboard, sterndrive, and inboard engines; trolling motors; propellers; engine control systems; electrical components and integrated systems; and marine parts and accessories. The boats we make include fiberglass sport boats, cruisers, sport fishing and center-console, offshore fishing, aluminum and fiberglass fishing, pontoon, utility, deck, inflatable, and heavy-gauge aluminum boats. Our fitness products include cardiovascular and strength training equipment for both the commercial and consumer markets. We also sell products for active aging and rehabilitation, a complete line of billiards tables, and other game room tables and accessories. 
 In 2018, we continued to successfully execute our growth strategy, acquiring new parts and accessories brands and investing in innovative products, productivity, and efficiency initiatives. We expect to continue our focus on growth in the combined marine business in 2019. With respect to the Fitness segment, our focus remains firmly on completing the separation of this business from the portfolio in a timely fashion, and in a manner that maximizes value to our shareholders. The spin-off process remains on plan, and we continue to evaluate other options, including a sale of the business. In 2019, our marine business will emphasize continued product leadership, targeted acquisitions, and other growth-related investments. In the longer term, our strategy remains consistent: to design, develop, and introduce high-quality products featuring innovative technology and styling; to distribute products through a model that benefits our partners - dealers and distributors; to provide world-class service to our customers; to develop and maintain low-cost manufacturing processes, and to continually improve productivity and efficiency; to manufacture and distribute products globally with local and regional styling; to continue implementing our capital strategy, which includes allocating capital to organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisition opportunities, managing debt levels and maturities, maintaining strong cash and liquidity positions, funding pension obligations, and continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and to attract and retain skilled employees. These strategic objectives support our plans to grow by expanding our existing businesses. Our primary objective is to enhance shareholder value by achieving returns on investments that exceed our cost of capital.

Refer to Note 7 – Segment Information and Note 3 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments and discontinued operations, including net sales, operating earnings, and total assets by segment.

Marine Engine Segment
The Marine Engine segment, which had net sales of $2,993.6 million in 2018, consists of the Mercury Marine Group (Mercury Marine). We believe our Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of recreational marine engines and marine parts and accessories. 

Mercury Marine manufactures and markets a full range of outboard, sterndrive, and inboard engine and propulsion systems under, among other brand names, Mercury, Mercury MerCruiser, Mercury Racing, and MotorGuide brands. In addition, Mercury Marine manufactures and markets parts and accessories under the Ancor, Attwood, BEP, Besto, BLA, Blue Sea Systems, CZone, FulTyme RV, Garelick, Lenco Marine, Marinco, Mastervolt, Mercury, Mercury Precision Parts, MotorGuide, Park Power, Progressive Industries, ProMariner, Quicksilver, and Seachoice brand names, including marine electronics and control integration systems, steering systems, instruments, controls, propellers, trolling motors, fuel systems, electrical systems, service parts, and lubricants, as well as specialty vehicle, mobile, and transportation aftermarket products. Mercury Marine supplies integrated propulsion systems to the worldwide recreational and commercial marine markets. To promote advanced propulsion systems with improved handling, performance, and efficiency, Mercury Marine also manufactures and markets advanced boat steering and engine control systems. 
Mercury Marine's outboard, sterndrive, and inboard engines are sold to independent boat builders, local, state, and foreign governments, and to Brunswick's Boat segment. In addition, Mercury Marine sells outboard engines through a global network of more than 6,000 marine dealers and distributors, specialty marine retailers, and marine service centers. White River Marine Group, LLC and its subsidiaries (including Tracker and Ranger Boats) is Mercury Marine’s most significant external customer.
Mercury Marine manufactures four-stroke outboard engine models ranging from 2.5 to 400 horsepower. These low-emission engines are in compliance with applicable U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements. Mercury Marine's four-stroke outboard engines include Verado, a collection of outboards ranging from 250 to 400 horsepower, and Mercury Marine's naturally aspirated four-stroke outboards, ranging from 2.5 to 300 horsepower. Mercury Marine and Mercury Racing manufacture 
1

inboard and sterndrive engine models ranging from 115 to 1,750 horsepower. Mercury Marine also manufactures two-stroke, non-DFI engines for certain markets outside the United States. In addition, most of Mercury Marine's sterndrive and inboard engines are now available with catalyst exhaust treatment and monitoring systems, and all are compliant with applicable U.S. state and federal environmental regulations. Mercury Marine also makes engines that comply with global emissions and noise regulations.
Mercury Marine continues to develop innovative products, including its all-new V8 FourStroke outboard family of engines, winning the 2018 Most Innovative Product at the New Zealand Boat Show, and a 2018 Innovation Award from the National Marine Manufacturers Association for the 3.4L V6 FourStroke outboard engines. Mercury Marine was awarded an IBEX Innovation Award in 2018 for its tiller handle assembly for portable outboard motors. 2018 also saw Mercury Marine open a state-of-the-art NVH (Noise, Vibration, Harshness) Technical Center at its global headquarters in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.

Mercury Marine produces its gasoline sterndrive and outboard engines domestically in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, with outboard engines also produced internationally in China and Japan. Mercury Marine manufactures 40, 50 and 60 horsepower four-stroke outboard engines in a facility in China, and produces smaller outboard engines in Japan pursuant to a joint venture with its partner, Tohatsu Corporation. Mercury Marine sources engine components from a global supply base and manufactures additional engine component parts at its Fond du Lac facility and plants in Florida and Mexico. Mercury Marine also operates a remanufacturing business for engines and service parts in Wisconsin. 
For the eighth consecutive year, the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council awarded Mercury Marine a “Green Masters” designation, a program measuring a broad range of sustainability issues including energy and water conservation, waste management, community outreach, and education. The designation highlights Mercury Marine's commitment to sustainability as discussed in its 2018 Sustainability Report, detailing specific goals related to energy, environment, products, and people, all of which goals Mercury Marine has met or exceeded. In addition, Mercury Marine won Sustainable Product of the Year from the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council for its Active Trim technology and was presented a Wisconsin Business Friend of the Environment Award in 2018.
Mercury Marine's Parts and Accessories Group distribution businesses include: Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Lankhorst Taselaar, BLA, Payne's Marine Group, and Del City. Parts and Accessories manufacturing businesses include Attwood, Garelick Mfg. Co.,Whale, Ancor, BEP, Blue Sea Systems, CZone, Lenco Marine, Marinco, Mastervolt, Park Power, Progressive Industries, and ProMariner. These businesses are leading manufacturers and distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities. 
On August 9, 2018, Brunswick acquired 100 percent of the Global Marine & Mobile business of Power Products Holdings, LLC (Power Products), including the global marine, specialty vehicle, mobile, industrial power, and transportation aftermarket products businesses of Power Products, for $910 million in cash from San Francisco-based private equity firm Genstar Capital. The acquisition added a broad, complementary product portfolio of 11 new brands to Mercury Marine's parts and accessories business.
Intercompany sales to Brunswick's Boat segment represented approximately 11 percent of Mercury Marine's sales in 2018. Domestic demand for the Marine Engine segment's products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year.

Boat Segment
The Boat segment consists of the Brunswick Boat Group (Boat Group), which manufactures and markets the following types of boats: fiberglass sport boats, cruisers, sport fishing and center-console, offshore fishing, aluminum and fiberglass fishing, pontoon, utility, deck, inflatable, and heavy-gauge aluminum. We believe that the Boat Group, which had net sales of $1,471.3 million during 2018, is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of pleasure motorboats.

The Boat Group manages Brunswick's boat brands; evaluates and optimizes the Boat segment's boat portfolio; promotes recreational boating services and activities to enhance the consumer experience and dealer profitability; and speeds the introduction of new technologies into boat manufacturing and design processes, including through its Business Acceleration initiatives.

The Boat Group includes the following boat brands: Sea Ray sport boats and cruisers; Bayliner sport cruisers, runabouts, and Heyday wake boats; Boston Whaler fiberglass offshore boats; Lund fiberglass fishing boats; Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Lowe, Lund, and Princecraft aluminum fishing, utility, pontoon boats, and deck boats; and Thunder Jet heavy-gauge aluminum boats. The Boat Group procures most of its outboard engines, gasoline sterndrive engines, and gasoline inboard engines from Brunswick's Marine Engine segment. 
2

The Boat Group also includes Brunswick boat brands based in Europe and Asia-Pacific, which include Quicksilver, Uttern, and Rayglass (including Protector and Legend), that are typically equipped with Mercury Marine engines and often include other parts and accessories supplied by Mercury Marine.

The Boat Group operates manufacturing facilities in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Washington, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Portugal, and owns an inactive manufacturing facility in North Carolina. The Boat Group also utilizes two contract manufacturing facilities in Poland.
The Boat Group sells its products through a global network of nearly 1,300 dealers and distributors, with some dealers operating in more than one location and some dealers carrying more than one of our boat brands. Sales to the Boat Group's largest dealer, MarineMax, Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group's product lines, represented approximately 24 percent of Boat Group sales in 2018. Domestic demand for pleasure boats is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year.
Fitness Segment
Our Fitness segment is comprised of the Fitness division (Fitness), which designs, manufactures, and distributes a broad portfolio of reliable, high-quality cardiovascular fitness equipment (including treadmills, total body cross-trainers, stair climbers, and stationary exercise bicycles) and strength-training equipment under the Life Fitness, Hammer Strength, Cybex, Indoor Cycling Group, and SCIFIT brands. The Fitness segment also includes an active recreation business, including billiards tables, accessories, and game room furniture. 
We believe that our Fitness segment, which had net sales of $1,038.3 million during 2018, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment. Fitness' commercial customers include health clubs, hospitality locations, multi-unit housing, corporations, schools and universities, military and governmental agencies, retirement and assisted living facilities, professional and collegiate sports teams, and community centers. Planet Fitness Inc. is the segment's most significant customer. Fitness makes commercial sales through its direct sales force, domestic dealers, and international distributors. Consumer products are available at specialty retailers, select mass merchants, sporting goods stores, through international distributors, and on the Life Fitness website. Further details about the Fitness business can be found in Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement on Form 10, File No. 001-38741, filed on February 8, 2019 by Life Fitness Holdings, Inc. However, we are not incorporating the Form 10 by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The billiards business was established in 1845 and is Brunswick's heritage business. The billiards business designs and markets billiards tables, table tennis tables, and Air Hockey tables, as well as game room furniture and related accessories, under the Brunswick and Contender brands. 
The Fitness segment's principal manufacturing facilities are located in Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and Hungary, with principal third party contract manufacturing partners in China, Mexico, Taiwan, and Indonesia. Fitness distributes its products worldwide from regional warehouses and production facilities. Demand for Fitness products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the fourth quarter of the year.
Discontinued Operations
In December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to exit its Sea Ray business, including the Meridian brand, as a result of, among other things, a material change in strategic direction and a review of the expected future cash flows, market conditions and business trends. The Company engaged in a thorough sales process and ultimately determined that the offers received did not reflect an appropriate value for the brand. As a result, in June 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to end the sale process for its Sea Ray business. As part of this action, the Company decided to restructure the businesses, including discontinuing Sea Ray Sport Yacht and Yacht models and winding down yacht production, while reinventing Sea Ray Sport Boat and Sport Cruiser operations. The winding down of Sea Ray Sport Yacht and Yacht operations was largely completed in 2018. The assets and liabilities of the Sea Ray business, which were reported as held for sale in the 2017 Form 10-K, have been reclassified to assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. Additionally, the results of these businesses are no longer presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in any period presented. 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company made adjustments to certain liabilities that were retained as part of the sale of the retail bowling business in 2014 and the bowling products business in 2015. The Company does not have continuing involvement or cash flows associated with these businesses, which were previously reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated 
3

Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. As a result of these adjustments, the Company recognized $2.2 million of after-tax earnings as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

Refer to Note 3 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.
Boating Services Network and Business Acceleration

Boating Services Network is our leading dealer finance and operations service that includes floor planning from Brunswick Acceptance Corporation (USA) and Brunswick Commercial Finance (Canada), retail finance from Blue Water Finance and Mercury Repower Finance, retail extended product protection from Passport and Passport Premier, private label limited warranties for leading boat and engine manufacturers, retail insurance from Boater's Choice Insurance, and close to 50 name brand marine dealer service providers from Brunswick Dealer Advantage. 
In 2018, Boating Services Network launched OnBoard Boating Cluband Rentals, a state-of-the-art, turnkey business platform empowering marine dealers and marinas to expand their operations and serve the emerging and rapidly growing boat club and rental consumer market segments. The suite of boats, tools, and services available through OnBoard enables club and rental operators to provide club members and rental customers an exceptional boating experience with a diverse fleet of newer boats, an easy-to-use online reservation system, incentives for members to become boat owners as they become captivated by the boating lifestyle, and many more benefits over time. We also launched NAUTIC-ON, a smart technology and service system that helps boaters stay connected with their boats remotely, monitoring engine status, battery and bilge pump, and providing other advanced features, in 2018. 
We provide financial services through Brunswick Product Protection Corporation, which provides marine dealers the opportunity to offer extended product warranties to retail customers, and through Blue Water Dealer Services, Inc., which provides retail financial services to marine dealers. Each company allows us to offer a more complete line of financial services to our boat and marine engine dealers and their customers.
Financing Joint Venture
Through our Brunswick Financial Services Corporation subsidiary, we own a 49 percent interest in a joint venture, Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC (BAC). Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, BAC provides secured wholesale inventory floorplan financing to our boat and engine dealers. A subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company owns the remaining 51 percent.
In February 2018, the parties entered into an amended and restated joint venture agreement (JV Agreement) to extend the term of their financial services through December 31, 2022. The JV Agreement contains a financial covenant that conforms to the maximum leverage ratio test in the Credit Facility described in Note 17 – Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The joint venture agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the agreement or the purchase of the other party’s interest in the joint venture at the end of its term. Alternatively, either partner may terminate the agreement at the end of its term.
Refer to Note 11 – Financing Joint Venture in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our financial services.

Distribution
We utilize independent distributors, dealers, and retailers (Dealers) for the majority of our boat sales and significant portions of our sales of marine engine, fitness, and billiards products. We have over 16,000 Dealers serving our business segments worldwide. Our marine Dealers typically carry one or more of the following product categories: boats, engines, and related parts and accessories.

We own Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Payne's Marine Group, and Del City, which comprise the primary parts and accessories distribution platforms for our Marine Engine segment in North America. We believe that these businesses, collectively, are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, with 21 distribution warehouses located throughout the United States and Canada offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities and Dealers. We also believe we are a leading parts and accessories distributor in the Asia-Pacific region.

Our Dealers are independent companies or proprietors that range in size from small, family-owned businesses to a large, publicly-traded corporation with substantial revenues and multiple locations. Some Dealers sell our products exclusively, while a majority also carry competitor and complementary products. We partner with our boat dealer network to improve quality, service, 
4

distribution, and delivery of parts and accessories to enhance the boating customer's experience.

Demand for a significant portion of our products is seasonal, and a number of our Dealers are relatively small and/or highly-leveraged. As a result, many Dealers secure floor plan financing from BAC or other third party finance companies, enabling them to provide stable channels for our products. In addition to the financing BAC offers, we may also provide our Dealers with incentive programs, loan guarantees, inventory repurchase commitments, and financing receivable arrangements, under which we are obligated to repurchase inventory or receivables from a finance company in the event of a Dealer's default. We believe that these arrangements are in our best interest; however, these arrangements expose us to credit and business risk. Our business units, along with BAC, maintain active credit operations to manage this financial exposure, and we continually seek opportunities to sustain and improve the financial health of our various distribution channel partners. Refer to Note 9 – Financing Receivables and Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these arrangements.
Technology and Innovation
 Upon the completion of the separation of our Fitness business, Brunswick will transition into a company concentrated on leading the global marine industry with a sharpened focus and clear vision, consistently innovating the future of recreational boating. To support this goal, we have established a strong foundation of cross functional and cross business investments and initiatives to further improve customer interaction with our products, including NAUTIC-ON and OnBoard Boating Club and Rentals. We continue to partner with TechNexus Holdings, LLC to identify and incubate innovative start-up ventures with strategic marine applications to help drive long-term growth. 
For its part, Fitness continues to develop digital solutions focused on providing innovative solutions to meet the needs of fitness facilities and exercisers. In addition, Fitness is collaborating with a number of technology companies to accelerate the development of its technology portfolio to satisfy growing demand for digital fitness and connectivity solutions. For further details about Fitness, see Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement on Form 10, File No. 001-38741, filed on February 8, 2019 by Life Fitness Holdings, Inc. 
International Operations
Non-U.S. sales are set forth in Note 7 – Segment Information and Note 2 – Revenue Recognition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are also included in the table below, which details our non-U.S. sales by region:

(in millions) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Europe | $ | 696.2 | | | $ | 610.1 | | | $ | 569.2 
Asia-Pacific | 437.0 | | | 407.9 | | | 363.1 | 
Canada | 317.3 | | | 320.3 | | | 284.6 | 
Rest-of-World | 256.8 | | | 265.8 | | | 240.1 | 
Total | $ | 1,707.3 | | | $ | 1,604.1 | | | $ | 1,457.0
Total International Sales as a Percentage of Net Sales | 33 | % | | 33 | % | | 35 | %

We transact a portion of our sales in non-U.S. markets in local currencies, while a meaningful portion of our product costs are denominated in U.S. dollars as a result of our U.S. manufacturing operations. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar affects the financial results of our non-U.S. operations. 
Marine Engine segment non-U.S. sales represented approximately 50 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2018. The segment's principal non-U.S. operations include the following:

• | Distribution, sales, service, engineering, or representative offices in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Dubai, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland;


• | Component, parts and accessories manufacturing, and light assembly facilities in Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Northern Ireland;


• | An outboard engine assembly plant in Suzhou, China; and


• | An outboard engine assembly plant operated by a joint venture in Japan.

Boat segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 21 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2018. The Boat Group manufactures or assembles a portion of its products in Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Portugal, as well as in boat plants owned and operated 
5

by third parties in Poland that perform contract manufacturing for us, which are sold mostly in international markets through Dealers. The Boat Group has sales or import offices in Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. Of our boat sales in Canada and Europe, approximately 38 percent and 91 percent, respectively, were produced in the region.
Fitness segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 29 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2018. Fitness sells its products worldwide and has sales and distribution centers in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The Fitness segment manufactures strength-training equipment and select lines of cardiovascular equipment in Hungary for its international markets, and has relationships with third-party contract manufacturing partners in Taiwan, China, Mexico, and Indonesia.

Raw Materials and Supplies
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including commodities such as aluminum, resins, oil, and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions. Significant increases in the cost of such materials would raise our production costs, which could reduce profitability if we did not recoup the increased costs through higher product prices.

As our manufacturing operations continued to raise production levels in 2018, our need for raw materials and supplies also increased. During 2018, we experienced some shortages or delayed delivery of certain materials, parts, and supplies essential to our manufacturing operations, although such shortages did not materially impact operations. We have addressed and will continue to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In 2019, we anticipate our suppliers will need to increase their manufacturing capacity and investments to meet the rising demand for their products and, in many cases, may need to hire additional workers in order to fulfill the orders placed by us and other customers. 

Our global procurement operations continue to better leverage purchasing power across our divisions and to improve supply chain and cost efficiencies. We mitigate commodity price risk on certain raw material purchases by entering into fixed priced contracts or derivatives to mitigate exposure related to changes in commodity prices.

Intellectual Property
We have, and continue to obtain, patent rights covering certain features of our products and processes. By law, our patent rights, which consist of patents and patent licenses, have limited lives and expire periodically. We believe that our patent rights are important to our competitive position in all of our business segments. Our trademark rights have indefinite lives, and many are well known to the public and are considered to be valuable assets. Most of our intellectual property is owned by U.S. entities. 

In the Marine Engine segment, patent rights principally relate to features of outboard engines and inboard-outboard drives, hybrid drives, and pod drives, including: die-cast powerheads; cooling and exhaust systems; drivetrain, clutch, and gearshift mechanisms; boat/engine mountings; shock-absorbing tilt mechanisms; ignition systems; propellers; marine vessel control systems; fuel and oil injection systems; supercharged engines; outboard mid-section structures; segmented cowls; hydraulic trim, tilt and steering; screw compressor charge air cooling systems; a range of proprietary metal alloys; and airflow silencers.

In the Boat segment, patent rights principally relate to processes for manufacturing fiberglass hulls, decks, and components for boat products, as well as patent rights related to boat features and components.

In the Fitness segment, patent rights principally relate to fitness equipment designs and components, including patents covering internal processes, programming functions, displays, design features and styling, as well as billiards table designs and components.

The following are our principal trademarks: 
Marine Engine Segment: Ancor, Attwood, Axius, BEP, Blue Sea Systems, CZone, Del City, FulTyme RV, Garelick, Kellogg Marine Supply, Land 'N' Sea, Lenco Marine, Marinco, Mariner, Mastervolt, MerCruiser, Mercury, Mercury Marine, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Mercury Racing, MotorGuide, OptiMax, Park Power, Progressive Industries, ProMariner, Quicksilver, Seachoice, SeaPro, SmartCraft, Sport-Jet, Swivl-Eze, Talamex, Valiant, Verado, Whale, and Zeus.

Competitive Conditions and Position
We believe that we have a reputation for quality in each of our highly competitive lines of business. We compete in various markets by: utilizing efficient production techniques; developing and strengthening our leading brands; developing and promoting innovative technological advancements; undertaking effective marketing, advertising, and sales efforts; providing high-quality, innovative products at competitive prices; and offering extensive aftermarket products.

Strong competition exists in each of our product groups, but no single enterprise competes with us in all product groups. In each product area, competitors range in size from large, highly-diversified companies to small, single-product businesses. We also indirectly compete with businesses that offer alternative leisure products or activities.
 The following summarizes our competitive position in each segment:

Marine Engine Segment: We believe the Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of recreational and commercial marine engines and marine parts and accessories. The marine engine market is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, including Japanese-based outboard engine manufacturers, as well as several smaller companies including Chinese manufacturers. Competitive advantage in this segment is a function of product features, technological leadership, quality, service, pricing, performance, manufacturing capabilities, depth of product portfolio, intuitive product controls, and durability, along with effective promotion and distribution.

Boat Segment: We believe that the Boat segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of pleasure motorboats. There are several major manufacturers of pleasure and offshore fishing boats, along with hundreds of smaller manufacturers. However, few major manufacturers compete in the breadth of categories or geographies in which our Boat segment competes. Consequently, this business is highly competitive by category but also highly fragmented. In all of our boat operations, we compete on the basis of product features, technology, quality, brand strength, dealer service, pricing, performance, value, durability and styling, along with effective promotion and distribution.
 Fitness Segment: We believe we are the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment and billiards tables. The fitness equipment industry is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, as well as many smaller manufacturers, which creates a highly fragmented, competitive landscape. Many of our fitness equipment offerings include industry-leading product features, and we place significant emphasis on introducing innovative fitness equipment to the market. Competitive focus is also placed on product quality, technology, service, pricing, state-of-the-art biomechanics, connectivity and customer solutions, and effective promotional activities. The billiards industry continues to experience competitive pressure from low-cost billiards manufacturers outside the United States. 

Research and Development
We strive to improve our competitive position in all of our segments by continuously investing in research and development to drive innovation in our products and manufacturing technologies. Our research and development investments support the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products. Research and development expenses were 2.9 percent, 3.0 percent and 3.1 percent of net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Research and development expenses by segment are discussed in Note 7 – Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
