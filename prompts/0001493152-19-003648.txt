ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. (“PIH”, the “Company”, “we”, or “us”) is an insurance holding company specialized in providing personal property insurance in coastal markets including those in Louisiana, Texas and Florida. These markets are characterized as regions where larger, national insurers have reduced their market share in favor of other, less catastrophe exposed markets. These markets are also characterized by state-administered residual insurers controlling large market shares. These unique markets can trace their roots to Hurricane Andrew, after which larger national carriers limited their capital allocation and approaches to property risk aggregation. These trends accelerated again after back to back exceptionally active hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005. However, the decade following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, had relatively few losses arising from tropical storm activity which led to declines in reinsurance pricing and increases in its availability. We were incorporated on October 2, 2012 in the State of Delaware to take advantage of these favorable dynamics where premium could be acquired relatively more quickly and under less competitive pressure than in other property insurance markets and where the cost of reinsurance, a significant expense for primary insurers, was declining from record high levels. We execute on this opportunity via a management team with expertise in the critical facets of our business: underwriting, claims, reinsurance, and operations. Within our three-state market, we seek to sell our products in territories with the highest rate per exposure and the least complexity in terms of risk. As of December 31, 2018 we covered risks under approximately 69,000 policies, an increase of over 35% from one year prior.
 
On November 19, 2013, we changed our legal name from Maison Insurance Holdings, Inc. to 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc., and on March 31, 2014, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock. Prior to March 31, 2014, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway America Inc., which, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway Financial Services Inc., or KFSI, a publicly owned Delaware holding company. As of December 31, 2018, KFSI and its affiliates no longer held any of our outstanding shares of common stock, but did hold warrants that, if exercised, would cause KFSI and its affiliates to hold an approximate 20% ownership interest in our common stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, Fundamental Global Investors, LLC and its affiliates, or FGI, beneficially owned approximately 45% of our outstanding shares of common stock. D. Kyle Cerminara, Chairman of our Board of Directors, serves as Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Partner of FGI, and Lewis M. Johnson, Co-Chairman of our Board of Directors, serves as President, Co-Founder and Partner of FGI.
 
We have four wholly-owned subsidiaries: Maison Insurance Company, or “Maison”, Maison Managers Inc., or “MMI”, ClaimCor, LLC, or “ClaimCor”, and PIH Re, Ltd.
 
Through Maison, we began providing property and casualty insurance to individuals in Louisiana in December 2012. In September 2015, Maison began writing manufactured home policies in the State of Texas on a direct basis, and in December 2017, Maison began writing wind/hail only policies in Florida via the assumption of policies from Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (“FL Citizens”). Our current insurance offerings in Louisiana, Texas, and Florida include homeowners insurance, manufactured home insurance and dwelling fire insurance. We write both full peril property policies as well as wind/hail only exposures and we produce new policies through a network of independent insurance agencies. We refer to the policies we write through independent agencies as voluntary policies versus those policies we have assumed through state-run insurers such as FL Citizens, which we refer to as take-out policies. We also wrote commercial business in Texas through a quota share agreement with Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company (“Brotherhood”). Through this agreement, we had assumed wind/hail only exposures on certain churches and related structures Brotherhood insures throughout the State of Texas. We discontinued this business effective January 1, 2018, as a result of our evaluation of the risk adjusted returns on this portion of our operations.

Maison has participated in six of the last seven rounds of take-outs from Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, or “LA Citizens”, as well as the inaugural depopulation of policies from the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association, or “TWIA”, which occurred on December 1, 2016. Under these programs, state-approved insurance companies, such as Maison, have the opportunity to assume insurance policies written by LA Citizens and TWIA. The majority of policies that we have obtained through LA Citizens as well as all of the policies we have obtained through TWIA cover losses arising only from wind and hail. Prior to our take-out, some of the LA Citizens and TWIA policyholders may not have been able to obtain such coverage from any other marketplace. Effective August 1, 2018, House Bill No. 333 (“HB 333”) became effective as Act No. 131 in the State of Louisiana and amended the law with respect to the depopulation of policies from LA Citizens. In July 2018, the Company was notified by LA Citizens of the number of policies which would be available for assumption by all insurers electing to participate in the December 1, 2018 depopulation under the new law. Due to the significant reduction of policies available when compared to those available for assumption in prior years, the Company did not participate in the December 1, 2018 assumption of policies from LA Citizens.
 
On March 1, 2017, Maison received a certificate of authority from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, or “FOIR”, which authorized Maison to write personal lines insurance in Florida. Pursuant to the Consent Order issued, Maison has agreed to comply with certain requirements as outlined by the FOIR until Maison can demonstrate three consecutive years of statutory net income following our admission into Florida as evidenced by its Annual Statement filed with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
 
On September 29, 2017, Maison received authorization from the FOIR to assume personal lines policies from Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (“FL Citizens”). Accordingly, on December 19, 2017, Maison entered the Florida market via the assumption of approximately $5.7 million in premium on approximately 3,500 policies from FL Citizens covering the perils of wind and hail only. Maison also participated in the December 18, 2018 depopulation of policies from FL Citizens whereby Maison assumed an additional 3,950 policies covering the perils of wind and hail only.
 
MMI serves as our management services subsidiary, known as a managing general agency, and provides underwriting, policy administration, claims administration, marketing, accounting and other management services to Maison. MMI contracts primarily with independent agencies for policy sales and services, and also contracts with an independent third-party for policy administration services. As a managing general agency, MMI is licensed by, and subject to, the regulatory oversight of the Louisiana Department of Insurance (“LDI”), Texas Department of Insurance (“TDI”) and the FOIR. MMI earns commissions on a portion of the premiums Maison writes, as well as a per policy fee which ranges from $25-$75 for providing policy administration, marketing, reinsurance contract negotiation, and accounting and analytical services.
 
ClaimCor is a claims and underwriting technical solutions company. Maison processes claims made by our policyholders through ClaimCor, and also through various third-party claims adjusting companies during times of high volume, so that we may provide responsive claims handling service when catastrophe events occur which impact many of our policyholders. We have the ultimate authority over the claims handling process, while the agencies that we appoint have no authority to settle our claims or otherwise exercise control over the claims process.
 
PIH Re, Ltd. is our Bermuda-domiciled reinsurance subsidiary. PIH Re, Ltd. was registered in Bermuda on December 6, 2018.

Equity Purchase Agreement with FedNat Holding Company
 
As previously announced on February 25, 2019, the Company, together with Maison, MMI and ClaimCor, entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with FedNat Holding Company, a Florida corporation (“Purchaser”), providing for the sale of all of the issued and outstanding equity of Maison, MMI and ClaimCor to Purchaser, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Sale”). As consideration for the sale of Maison, MMI and ClaimCor, Purchaser has agreed to pay the Company $51.0 million, consisting of $25.5 million in cash (the “Cash Consideration”) and $25.5 million in Purchaser’s common stock (the “Equity Consideration”) to be issued to the Company. In addition, upon closing of the Asset Sale (the “Closing”), up to $18.0 million of outstanding surplus note obligations payable by Maison to the Company, plus all accrued but unpaid interest (other than default rates of interest, penalties, late fees and other related charges), will be repaid to the Company.


The Equity Consideration is expected to be issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Standstill Agreement to be entered into among the Company and Purchaser at the Closing. The Company and Purchaser also plan to enter into a Registration Rights Agreement at the Closing providing for the registration under the Securities Act, as amended, of the resale of the Equity Consideration.
 
All of the employees of MMI are expected to become employees of Purchaser as of the Closing, either directly or by remaining employees of MMI, other than John S. Hill, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, and Brian D. Bottjer, the Company’s Controller, who the Company expects to hire as employees of the Company after the Closing. Douglas N. Raucy, the Company’s current President and Chief Executive Officer and a director, and Dean E. Stroud, the Company’s current Vice President and Chief Underwriting Officer, have entered into employment agreements with Purchaser, with the effectiveness of such agreements subject to the occurrence of the Closing and continuous employment with the Company through the Closing.


The Company, and not its stockholders, will receive the Cash Consideration and the Equity Consideration from the Asset Sale. The Company does not intend to liquidate following the Closing. The Company’s board of directors will evaluate alternatives for the use of the Cash Consideration, which are expected to include using a portion of the Cash Consideration to conduct the business of PIH Re, Ltd., and launching a new growth strategy focused on reinsurance, investment management and new investment opportunities. The Company may form an additional reinsurance subsidiary in a suitable jurisdiction.
 
Purchaser’s obligation to close the Asset Sale is subject to Maison, MMI and ClaimCor having a consolidated net book value of at least $42 million at the Closing (without considering the effect of the repayment of the surplus notes), Maison having at the Closing statutory surplus of at least $29 million after accounting for the full repayment of all of the surplus notes in effect at the closing, total capital and surplus assets equal to or greater than 300% of its total risk-based capital on all authorized control level risk-based capital requirements as of December 31, 2018, and there being no change to Maison’s “A” rating with Demotech, Inc. as of the Closing, other than changes resulting from the execution of the Purchase Agreement or the circumstances of Purchaser.


In connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company and Purchaser plan to enter into a Reinsurance Capacity Right of First Refusal Agreement (the “Reinsurance ROFR Agreement”) at the Closing pursuant to which the Company will have a right of first refusal to sell reinsurance coverage to the insurance company subsidiaries of Purchaser, providing reinsurance on up to 7.5% of annual in force limit of any layer in Purchaser’s catastrophe reinsurance program purchased by Purchaser and its subsidiaries, subject to the annual reinsurance limit of $15 million, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Reinsurance ROFR Agreement. All reinsurance sold by the Company pursuant to the right of first refusal will be memorialized in an agreement in such form and subject to such terms and conditions as are customary in the property and casualty insurance industry. The Reinsurance ROFR Agreement will be assignable by the Company subject to conditions set forth in the agreement. The term of the Reinsurance ROFR Agreement will be five years.
 
In addition, at the Closing, the Company and Purchaser plan to enter into a five-year agreement, pursuant to which the Company will provide investment advisory services to Purchaser for $100,000 per year.

The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties, including covenants concerning the conduct of business by Maison, MMI and ClaimCor prior to Closing. The Company is permitted to solicit superior offers to acquire its insurance businesses, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, during a 30-day go-shop period beginning on February 25, 2019. After the expiration of the go-shop period, the Company and its representatives will be prohibited from initiating, soliciting, knowingly facilitating, encouraging or engaging in discussions or negotiations relating to any competing acquisition proposal, subject to certain limited exceptions. In addition, the Company and Purchaser have agreed to use their commercially reasonable best efforts to consummate the Asset Sale and other transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. Subject to certain limitations, the Company and Purchaser have also agreed to indemnify the other party against certain losses, including losses arising out of breaches of representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
 
The Company and Purchaser anticipate closing the Asset Sale on or before June 30, 2019, subject to the timely receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions, including approval of the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein by the stockholders of the Company.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive market and face competition from national and regional insurance companies, many of whom are larger and have greater financial and other resources and offer more diversified insurance coverage. Our competitors include companies which market their products through independent agents, as well as companies with captive agents. Large national companies may have certain competitive advantages over regional companies such as ours, including increased name recognition, increased loyalty of their customer base and reduced policy acquisition costs.
 
We may also face competition from new entrants in our niche markets. In some cases, these companies may price their products below ours due to their interest in quickly growing their business. Although our pricing is inevitably influenced to some degree by that of our competitors, we believe that it is generally not in our best interest to compete solely on price. We also compete on the basis of underwriting criteria, our distribution network and superior policy, underwriting and claims service to our agents and insureds.
 
Some of the national and regional companies which compete with us include Access Home Insurance Company, American Integrity Insurance Company, Americas Insurance Company, ASI Lloyds, Centauri Specialty Insurance Company, Family Security Insurance Company, FedNat Insurance Company, First Community Insurance Company, Gulfstream Property and Casualty Insurance Company, Imperial F&C Insurance Company, Lighthouse Property Insurance Corporation, Safepoint Insurance Company, Southern Fidelity Insurance, and United Property & Casualty.
 
Claims Administration
 
Claims administration and adjusting involves the handling of routine “non-catastrophic” as well as catastrophic claims. In the event of a hurricane or other catastrophic claim, our claims volume would increase significantly. Rather than increase the size of our staff in anticipation of such an event, we believe that outsourcing a portion of our claims handling improves our operational efficiency because an appropriately selected third party will have the resources to adjust the catastrophe related claims cost effectively and with the level of service we endeavor to provide for our policyholders. Accordingly, we have outsourced our claims adjusting program to certain third party adjusters with experience in Texas, Louisiana and Florida. Under the terms of the service contract between Maison and MMI, MMI handles the claims administration for both catastrophic and non-catastrophic insurable events. In handling the claims administration, the examiner for MMI reviews all claims and loss reports, and if warranted, investigates such claims and losses.
 
Field adjusting is outsourced to our wholly-owned subsidiary, ClaimCor, as well as third-party service providers, who, subject to company guidance and oversight, either settle or contest the claims. Approval for payment of a claim is given by MMI after careful review of the field adjuster’s report. We pay adjusters based on a pre-determined fee schedule. Although we are ultimately responsible for paying the claims made by our policyholders, we believe that outsourcing our claims handling program while maintaining an oversight function is an efficient mechanism for handling individual matters. Furthermore, by delivering responsive service in a challenging situation, we optimize the relationship between insured and insurer.

Reinsurance
 
Maison follows the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its risk. When an insurance company purchases reinsurance, it transfers or “cedes” all or a portion of its exposure on insurance underwritten by it to another insurer-the “reinsurer.” Although reinsurance is intended to reduce an insurance company’s risk, the ceding of insurance does not legally discharge the insurance company from its primary liability for the full obligation of its policies. If the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement, the ceding company is still required to pay the insured for the loss. Maison and its reinsurance broker are selective in choosing reinsurers and they consider various factors, including, but not limited to, the financial stability of the reinsurers, and the reinsurers’ history of responding to claims, as well as the reinsurer’s overall reputation in making such determinations.
 
From year-to-year, both the availability of reinsurance and the costs associated with the acquisition of reinsurance will vary. These fluctuations are not subject to our control and may limit our insurance subsidiary’s ability to purchase adequate coverage.
 
In order to limit the credit risk associated with amounts which may become due from our reinsurers, Maison predominantly uses several different reinsurers, which have an A.M. Best Rating of A- (Excellent) or better. Absent such rating, we have required the reinsurers to place collateral on deposit with an independent financial institution under a trust agreement for our benefit. A list of some of the reinsurance companies which we currently use includes Allianz Risk Transfer, Aeolus Re, Ltd, Everest Re, DaVinci Re, Renaissance Re, Poseidon Re, and Gen Re, as well as various Lloyd’s of London participating syndicates.
 
The Company’s excess of loss reinsurance treaties are based upon a treaty year beginning on June 1st of each year and expiring on May 31st of the following year. Thus, the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 contain premiums ceded under three separate excess of loss treaties. Under both the Company’s 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 excess of loss treaties, for each catastrophic event occurring within a 144-hour period, the Company receives reinsurance recoveries of up to $170 million in excess of a retention of $5 million per event. The Company had also procured another layer of reinsurance protection that can be used for any event above $175 million, up to a maximum recovery of $25 million. This $25 million second layer of coverage applies in total to all events occurring during the respective treaty year. For the six month period beginning on June 1, 2018 and ending on December 30, 2018, the Company’s excess of loss treaty covered losses of up to $252,000 in excess of a retention of $10,000 per occurrence. Effective December 31, 2018, the Company procured an additional layer of coverage having a single-limit of $5,000 in excess of a retention of $5,000. Thus, for the period beginning December 31, 2018 and ending on May 31, 2019, the Company’s excess of loss treaty covers losses of up to $252,000 in excess of a retention of $5,000 per occurrence. We have also purchased reinstatement premium protection contracts to indemnify us against the potential cost of reinstatement premiums. Our coverage also reduces our retention in multiple event scenarios through the purchase of three subsequent event contracts. The first subsequent event contract has an occurrence limit of $6,000, an occurrence retention of $4,000, and is subject to an otherwise recoverable amount of $6,000. The second subsequent event contract has an occurrence limit of $3,000, an occurrence retention of $1,000, and is subject to an otherwise recoverable amount of $6,000. Both of these subsequent event contracts include one prepaid reinstatement. The third subsequent event contract provides $10,000 of additional reinstatement limit for first layer of the catastrophe program and attaches after the first reinstatement has been completely exhausted. Furthermore, for the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund Reimbursement Contracts effective June 1, 2018, the Company has elected 45% coverage on its Florida exposures. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has not recorded any recoveries due under its 2018/2019 catastrophe excess of loss program.
 
Investments
 
We hold an investment portfolio comprised primarily of fixed income securities issued by the U.S. government, government agencies and high quality corporate issuers. The fixed income portfolio is managed by a third-party investment management firm in accordance with the investment policies and guidelines approved by the investment committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. These guidelines stress the preservation of capital, market liquidity and the diversification of risk and are reviewed on a regular basis in order to ensure that our investment policy evolves in response to changes in the financial market. Additionally, the Board’s investment committee also identifies, evaluates and approves suitable alternative investment opportunities for the Company. This has resulted in a number of equity investments managed by the committee which represent approximately 7.9% of the Company’s total investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018. Investments held by the Company’s insurance subsidiary must also comply with applicable domiciliary state regulations that prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments.

Technology
 
Our business depends upon the use, development and implementation of integrated technology systems. These systems enable us to provide a high level of service to agents and policyholders by: processing business in a timely and efficient manner; communicating and sharing data with agents; providing a variety of methods for the payment of premiums; and allowing for the accumulation and analysis of information for the management of our insurance subsidiary. We believe the availability and use of these technology systems has resulted in improved service to agents and customers and increased efficiencies in processing the business of Maison and resulted in lower operating costs.
Regulation
 
We are subject to the laws and regulations in Louisiana, Florida and Texas, and will be subject to the regulations of any other states in which we may seek to conduct business in the future. In these states, it is the duty of each respective department of insurance to administer the provisions of the insurance code in that state. The purpose of each state’s insurance code is to regulate the insurance industry in all of its phases, including, but not limited to the following: licensing of insurers and producers, regulation of investments and solvency, approval of forms and rates, and market conduct. Furthermore, as Maison is domiciled in the State of Louisiana, the LDI conducts periodic examinations of the financial condition and market conduct of Maison and requires Maison to file financial and other reports on a quarterly and annual basis.
 
Regulation of the Payment of Dividends and other Transactions between Affiliates
 
Dividends paid by Maison are restricted by the Louisiana Insurance Code. Dividends can only be paid if Maison’s paid-in capital and surplus exceed the minimum required by the Louisiana Insurance Code. Any dividend or distribution (that when aggregated with any other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months) which exceeds the lesser of (a) ten percent of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding; or (b) the net income of the insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the twelve month period ending the thirty-first day of December next preceding; is considered to be extra-ordinary and shall not be paid until thirty days after the LDI has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within that period disapproved the payment, or until the LDI has approved the payment within the thirty-day period. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extra-ordinary, an insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out in dividends. Furthermore, pursuant to the Consent Order issued to us as a condition to our writing insurance in Florida, Maison is restricted from issuing any dividends to its stockholder without receiving prior approval from the FOIR. As of December 31, 2018, Maison has not paid any dividends to its sole stockholder, PIH.
 
Our other subsidiary companies collect the majority of their revenue through their affiliation with Maison. Our subsidiary company MMI, earns commission income from Maison for underwriting, policy administration, claims handling, and other services provided to Maison. Our subsidiary company, ClaimCor, earns claims adjusting income for adjusting certain of the claims of Maison’s policyholders. While dividend payments from our other subsidiaries are not restricted under insurance law, the underlying contracts between Maison and our other subsidiary companies are regulated by, and subject to the approval of, insurance regulators.
 
Maison is subject to state laws and regulations regarding approval of rates and rules with respect to its insurance policies. Each state’s respective insurance department has the authority to approve insurance rates or rate changes for the lines of property and casualty insurance which Maison writes. Maison’s ability to change rates and the relative timing of the rate making process are dependent upon each state’s statutory and regulatory requirements.
 
PIH, as the parent company of Maison, is subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Louisiana, which, among other things, regulate the terms of surplus notes issued by insurers to their parent company. As of December 31, 2018, Maison’s capital includes seven surplus notes issued to PIH in the amount of $18,000, all of which were approved by the LDI prior to their issuance. Interest payments on the notes are due annually, and are also subject to prior approval by the LDI.
 
Requirements for Exiting Geographic Markets and/or Canceling or Non-renewing Policies
 
Maison is subject to Florida, Louisiana and Texas state laws and regulations which may restrict Maison’s timing or ability to either discontinue or substantially reduce its writings in the states in which it operates. These laws and regulations limit the reasons for cancellation or non-renewal, typically require prior notice, and in some instances require prior approval from the respective regulatory agency. For example, in Louisiana, no insurer may cancel or fail to renew a homeowner’s policy of insurance or increase the policy deductible that has been in effect and renewed for more than three years unless the change is based upon non-payment of premium, fraud of the insured, a material change in the risk being insured, two or more claims within a period of three years, or if continuance of such policy endangers the solvency of the insurer.

Risk of Assessment by Florida, Louisiana and Texas
 
Maison is a member of the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association as a condition of its authority to transact insurance in Louisiana and is subject to assessment as set forth in the Louisiana Insurance Code.
 
Maison is also required to participate, as a condition of its authority to transact insurance in Louisiana, in the residual insurance market programs operated by Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation and designated as the Coastal Plan and the Fair Plan. Maison is subject to assessment as set forth in the Louisiana Insurance Code for its participation in the Coastal Plan and its participation in the Fair Plan.
 
As a property insurer licensed in Texas, Maison is a member of TWIA, which provides wind and hail coverage to coastal risks unable to procure coverage in the voluntary market. Maison may become subject to assessment from TWIA should a major loss event deplete TWIA’s available loss reserves and reinsurance coverage. Maison is also a member insurer of the Texas Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association and the FAIR Plan and is subject to assessment by each as set forth in the Texas Insurance Code.
 
As we have entered into the Florida market, Maison will be required to participate in the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association (“FIGA”) and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”), and is also subject to assessment from FL Citizens. FIGA services claims of member insurance companies which have become insolvent and are ordered to be liquidated. In the event of an insolvency, Maison may be subject to assessment from FIGA based upon the amount of premium Maison writes in Florida. Similarly, as an admitted insurer in Florida, Maison is subject to assessment from the FHCF and FL Citizens based upon the amount of premium Maison writes in Florida. While current regulations allow the Company to recover from policyholders the amount of these assessments imposed upon the Company, the Company’s payment of the assessments and recoveries may not offset each other in the same year.
 
Insurance Regulatory Information System
 
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) developed the Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) to help state regulators identify companies that may require special attention. Using IRIS, financial examiners develop key financial ratios in order to assess the financial condition of insurance companies such as Maison. Each ratio has an established “usual range” of results. A ratio which falls outside the usual range however, is not considered a failing result, but instead may be viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. In some cases, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside of the usual range.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, Maison had twelve of the thirteen IRIS ratio results within the usual range. The only ratio with results that fell outside of the usual range was caused by Maison’s yield on investments being below the lower end of the usual range of 2% due to manner in which approved interest payments on the surplus notes issued by Maison are recorded. When approved, these payments are charged against investment income on Maison’s statutory financial statements.
 
Management does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of these IRIS ratio results.
 
Risk Based Capital Requirements
 
In the United States, a risk-based capital (“RBC”) formula is used by the NAIC to identify property and casualty insurance companies that may not be adequately capitalized. Most states, including Louisiana, Texas and Florida, have adopted the NAIC RBC requirements. In general, insurers reporting surplus with respect to policyholders below 200% of the authorized control level, as defined by the NAIC, on December 31st of the previous year are subject to varying levels of regulatory action, which may include discontinuation of operations. Furthermore, pursuant to the consent orders approving Maison’s admission into the States of Texas and Florida, Maison has agreed to maintain a RBC ratio of 300% or more, and provide calculation of such ratio to the TDI on a periodic basis. As of December 31, 2018, Maison’s RBC ratio was 361%.

State Deposits
 
States routinely require deposits of assets for the protection of policyholders. As of December 31, 2018, Maison held certificates of deposit with an estimated fair value of approximately $100,000 and $300,000 as a deposit with the LDI and FOIR, respectively. Maison also held cash and investment securities with an estimated fair value of approximately $1.98 million as of December 31, 2018 as a deposit with the TDI.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018 we had thirty-seven employees, twenty-one of whom work at our offices in Tampa, Florida, three of whom work at our offices in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, six of whom work from our offices in Dallas, Texas, and seven of whom work from home offices in Louisiana, Texas, Georgia and Florida. From time to time, we employ and supplement our staff with temporary employees and consultants. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory. Each of our employees has entered into confidentiality agreements with us.
