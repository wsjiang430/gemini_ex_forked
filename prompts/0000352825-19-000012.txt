Rail Products and Services
The Company’s Rail Products and Services (“Rail”) segment is comprised of several manufacturing, distribution, and service businesses that provide a variety of products and services for freight and passenger railroads and industrial companies throughout the world. The Rail segment has sales offices throughout North America and Europe, and works on rail projects where it offers products manufactured by the Company, or sourced from numerous supply chain partners, and aftermarket services. The Rail segment is comprised of the following business units: Rail Products and Rail Technologies.
Rail Products
The Rail Products business is comprised of the Company’s Rail Distribution, Allegheny Rail Products, Transit, and Concrete Tie divisions.
Rail Distribution sells new rail mainly to passenger and short line freight railroads, industrial companies, and rail contractors for the replacement of existing lines or expansion of new lines. Rail accessories sold by the Rail Distribution division include track spikes, bolts, angle bars, and other products required to install or maintain rail lines. These products are manufactured by the Company or purchased from other manufacturers and distributed accordingly. Rail Distribution also sells trackwork products to Class II and III railroads, industrial, and export markets.
The Company’s Allegheny Rail Products (“ARP”) division engineers and fabricates insulated rail joints and related accessories for freight and passenger railroads and industrial customers. Insulated joints are manufactured at the Company’s facilities in Pueblo, CO and Niles, OH.
The Company’s Transit Products division supplies power rail, direct fixation fasteners, coverboards, and special accessories primarily for passenger railroad systems. These products are fabricated at Company facilities or by subcontractors and are usually sold by sealed bid to passenger railroads or to rail contractors.
The Concrete Tie division manufactures engineered concrete railroad ties for freight and passenger railroads and industrial companies at its facility in Spokane, WA.
Rail Technologies
The Company’s Rail Technologies business unit engineers, manufactures, and fabricates friction management products and application systems, railroad condition monitoring systems and equipment, wheel impact load detection, rail anchors and spikes, wayside data collection and management systems, epoxy and nylon-encapsulated insulated rail joints, and track fasteners, and provides aftermarket services. The Company’s friction management products control the friction at the rail/wheel interface, helping our customers reduce fuel consumption, improve operating efficiencies, extend the life of operating assets such as rail and wheels, reduce track stresses, and lower related maintenance and operating costs. Friction management products include mobile and wayside systems that apply lubricants and liquid or solid friction modifiers. These products and systems are designed, engineered, manufactured, fabricated, and marketed by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries located in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany.
Construction Products
The Construction Products (“Construction”) segment is composed of the following business units: Piling and Fabricated Bridge Products and Precast Concrete Products.
Piling and Fabricated Bridge Products
Sheet piling products are interlocking structural steel sections that are generally used to provide lateral support at construction sites. Bearing piling products are steel H-beam sections which are driven into the ground for support of structures such as bridge piers and high-rise buildings. Piling is often used in water and land applications including cellular cofferdams and OPEN CELL® structures in inland river systems and ports.
Piling products are sourced from various manufacturers and either sold or rented to project owners and contractors. The Piling division, via a sales force deployed throughout the United States, markets and sells piling products domestically and internationally. This division offers its customers various types and dimensions of structural beam piling, sheet piling, and pipe piling. The Company is the primary distributor of domestic steel sheet piling for its primary supplier.
The Fabricated Bridge Products facility in Bedford, PA manufactures a number of fabricated steel and aluminum products primarily for the highway, bridge, and transit industries including concrete reinforced steel grid deck, open steel grid deck, aluminum bridge railing, and stay-in-place steel bridge forms.
Precast Concrete Products
The Precast Concrete Products unit primarily manufactures concrete buildings for national, state, and municipal parks. This unit manufactures restrooms, concession stands, and other protective storage buildings available in multiple designs, textures, and colors. The Company is a leading high-end supplier in terms of volume, product options, and capabilities. The unit also manufactures various other precast products such as burial vaults, bridge beams, box culverts, septic tanks, and other custom pre-stressed and precast concrete products. The products are manufactured in Spokane, WA, Hillsboro, TX, and Waverly, WV.
Tubular and Energy Services
The Tubular and Energy Services (“Tubular and Energy”) segment has two primary business units: Protective Coatings and Measurement Systems and Test, Inspection, and Threading Services. The segment provides products and services predominantly to the mid and upstream oil and gas markets.
Protective Coatings and Measurement Systems
The Protective Coatings and Measurement Systems business unit consists of operations at two primary locations. The Birmingham, AL facility coats the outside and inside diameter of pipe primarily for oil and gas transmission pipelines. This location partners with its primary customer, a pipe manufacturer, to market fusion bonded epoxy coatings, abrasion resistant coatings, and internal linings for a wide variety of pipe diameters for pipeline projects throughout North America.
The second location is in Willis, TX and consists of two operating facilities. One facility applies specialty outside and inside diameter coatings for a wide variety of pipe diameters for oil and gas transmission, mining, and waste water pipelines as well as provides custom coatings for specialty fittings and connections. The second facility manufactures and provides a turnkey solution for metering and injection systems for the oil, and, to a lesser extent, gas industry. This location operates a fabrication plant that builds metering systems for custody transfer applications including crude oil and other petroleum-based products. These systems are used at well sites, pipelines, refineries, chemical plants, and loading/unloading facilities. The location also manufactures and installs additive and dye injection systems. These systems are used to inject performance additives and/or dyes into petroleum products.
Test, Inspection, and Threading Services
The Company provides inspection and tubular integrity management services for the upstream oil and gas industry. Services include non-destructive testing, inspection, and other asset integrity services such as repair and threading for Oil Country Tubular Goods (“OCTG”) and drill tools. Inspection and testing of these products, which include replaceable and re-usable products such as casing, production tubing, drill pipe, directional motors, drill collars, and related equipment, is a critical preventative measure to ensure personnel and well-site safety, enhance efficiency, and avoid costly equipment failures and well-site shutdowns. The Company offers these services in every major oil and gas producing region throughout the United States.
The Company provides asset integrity services such as repair and threading for tubular and drill tools. Our facilities cut, thread, and paint pipe primarily for water well applications for the agriculture industry, municipal water authorities, and OCTG markets.
Marketing and Competition
L.B. Foster Company generally markets its Rail Products and Services directly in all major industrial areas of the United States, Canada, and Europe. The Construction Products and Tubular and Energy Services are primarily marketed domestically. The Company employs a sales force of approximately 79 people that is supplemented with a network of agents across Europe, South America, and Asia to reach current customers and cultivate potential customers in these areas. For the years ended 2018 and 2017, approximately 23% and 19%, respectively, of the Company’s total sales were outside the United States.
The major markets for the Company’s products are highly competitive. Product availability, quality, service, and price are principal factors of competition within each of these markets. No other company provides the same product mix to the various markets
 the Company serves. However, there are one or more companies that compete with the Company in each product line. Therefore, the Company faces significant competition from different groups of companies.
During 2018 and 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.
Raw Materials and Supplies
Most of the Company’s products are purchased in the form of finished or semi-finished products. The Company purchases the majority of its supplies from domestic and foreign steel producers. Generally, the Company has a number of vendor options. However, the Company has an arrangement with a steel mill to distribute steel sheet piling in North America. Should sheet piling from its present supplier not be available for any reason, the Company risks not being able to provide such product to its customers.
The Company’s purchases from foreign suppliers are subject to foreign currency exchange rate changes as well as the usual risks associated with changes in international conditions and to United States and international laws that could impose import restrictions on selected classes of products and for anti-dumping duties if products are sold in the United States at prices that are below specified prices.
Backlog
The Company’s backlog represents the sales price of received customer purchase orders or contracts in which the performance obligations have not been met, and thus are precluded from revenue recognition. Although we believe that the orders included in backlog are firm, our customers may cancel or change their orders with limited advance notice; however, these instances are rare. Backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. The backlog as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 by business segment is as follows:

 | December 31, | | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 
Rail Products and Services | $ | 97,447 | | $ | 68,850 
Construction Products | 95,419 | | 71,318
Tubular and Energy Services | 27,552 | | 26,737
Total | $ | 220,418 | | $ | 166,905

Approximately 6.7% of the December 31, 2018 backlog is related to projects that will extend beyond 2019.
Research and Development
Expenditures for research and development approximated $2,646 and $2,241 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. These expenditures were predominately associated with expanding product lines and capabilities within the Company’s Rail Technologies business.
Patents and Trademarks
The Company owns a number of domestic and international patents and trademarks primarily related to its Rail Technologies products. Our business segments are not dependent upon any individual patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks, and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent or trademark, or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product, to be of material importance in relation to our total business.
Environmental Disclosures
Information regarding environmental matters is included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.
Employees and Employee Relations
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 1,480 employees, 1,298 located within the Americas and 182 located in Europe. There were 828 hourly production workers and 652 salaried employees. Of the hourly production workers, approximately 139 are represented by unions. The Company has not suffered any major work stoppages during the past five years and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory.
Two collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 35 and 78 employees were successfully renegotiated during 2017 and are scheduled to expire in March 2020 and September 2021, respectively.
Substantially all of the Company’s hourly paid employees are covered by one of the Company’s noncontributory, defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans. Substantially all of the Company’s salaried employees are covered by defined contribution plans.
Concrete Tie Settlement Agreement
On March 13, 2019, the Company and its subsidiary, CXT Incorporated (“CXT”) entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Union Pacific Railroad (“UPRR”) to resolve the pending litigation in the matter of Union Pacific
 Railroad Company v. L.B. Foster Company and CXT Incorporated, Case No. CI 15-564, in the District Court for Douglas County, Nebraska. The lawsuit related to UPRR's claims that the Company and CXT breached their express warranty, implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and anticipatorily repudiated their warranty obligations with respect to the manufacture and sale of pre-stressed concrete railroad ties to UPRR, and UPRR sought to recover damages in an amount to be determined at trial for the value of unfulfilled warranty replacement ties and ties likely to become warranty eligible, costs for cover for replacement ties, and various incidental and consequential damages. The Company denied liability to UPRR and asserted that UPRR's conduct was wrongful and unjustified and asserted defenses and counterclaims.
Under the Settlement Agreement, the Company and CXT will pay UPRR the aggregate amount of $50,000 without pre-judgment interest, beginning with a $2,000 immediate payment, and with the remaining $48,000 paid in installments over a six-year period commencing on the effective date of the Settlement Agreement through December 2024 pursuant to a Promissory Note. Additionally, commencing in January 2019 and through December 2024, UPRR has agreed to purchase from the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, a cumulative total amount of $48,000 of products and services, targeting $8,000 of annual purchases per year beginning in 2019 per letters of intent under the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement also includes a mutual release of all claims and liability regarding or relating to all CXT pre-stressed concrete railroad ties with no admission of liability and dismissal of the litigation with prejudice.
