Introduction 
 
NioCorp was incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on February 27, 1987 under the name “IPC International Prospector Corp.” On May 22, 1991, we changed our name to “Kingston Resources Ltd.” On June 29, 2001, we changed our name to “Butler Developments Corp.” On February 12, 2009, we changed our name to “Butler Resource Corp.” On March 4, 2010, we changed our name to “Quantum Rare Earth Developments Corp.” On March 4, 2013, we changed our name to “NioCorp Developments Ltd.”
 
NioCorp is a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and New Brunswick. Our registered and records office is located at 595 Burrard Street, Suite 2600, Vancouver, British Columbia V7X 1L3 (ATTN: Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP). Our principal executive office is located at 7000 South Yosemite Street, Suite 115, Centennial, Colorado 80112.
 
Historical Development of the Business
 
During 2009 and 2010, the Company commenced mineral exploration activities in the Elk Creek, Nebraska area, including negotiations with local landowners for land access agreements. The acquisition of the Elk Creek Property was closed in December 2010 and involved the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of 0859404 BC Ltd., a private British Columbia company, which in turn held 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of ECRC and was signatory to the option agreements covering the Elk Creek Property area. A new Canadian company, 0886338 BC Ltd. was formed to merge with 0859404 BC Ltd., and this merged entity was subsequently amalgamated into 0896800.
 
The Company commenced a field exploration program in 2011, which included verification of previous work which was completed on the Elk Creek Property in the 1970s and 1980s, re-assaying of historic drill core, an airborne geophysical survey and the completion of five new diamond drillholes. The available data for the Elk Creek Property was compiled into an updated NI 43-101 resource estimate for the Elk Creek Project, which was issued in April 2012. Additional drilling and NI 43-101 technical reports, including resource updates and PEAs, were completed and issued by the Company in 2014 and 2015.
 
During fiscal years 2016 and 2017, the Company focused on feasibility study development and, on June 30, 2017, we announced the completion of the 2017 Feasibility Study.
 
In connection with a review by the OSC, on December 15, 2017, the Company filed a revised 2017 Feasibility Study. This revised study contained no changes to any previously reported numbers or forecasted economic returns of the Elk Creek Project from those contained in the originally filed 2017 Feasibility Study.
 
During fiscal years 2018 and 2019, Company efforts were directed towards obtaining the financing necessary to advance the Elk Creek Project to construction and operations, and we conducted permitting, engineering and other related activities for the advancement of the Elk Creek Project. During fiscal year 2019, we received the new mine design based on detailed underground engineering conducted by Nordmin. On April 16, 2019, we announced the results of the updated underground mine design and supporting infrastructure, the results of an update to the Elk Creek Project’s mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, and the 2019 Elk Creek Feasibility Study based on the new mine design. A full NI 43-101 technical report, incorporating the results of the 2019 Elk Creek Feasibility Study, was filed on SEDAR on May 29, 2019 with an effective date of April 16, 2019.
 
Information regarding the 2019 Elk Creek Feasibility Study is discussed below under Item 2., “Properties.”

Emerging Growth
 
Company Status
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 101 of the JOBS Act as we do not have more than $1.07 billion in annual gross revenue and did not have such amount as of June 30, 2019, this being the last day of our most recently completed fiscal year.
 
We may lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year during which (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion or (ii) we issue more than $1.07 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company if at any time we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 405 under the Exchange Act. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of Common Shares pursuant to an effective registration statement.
 
As an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we have elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. The election is irrevocable.
 
As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act. Such sections are described below:
 

● | Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a public company’s auditor to attest to, and report on, management’s assessment of its internal controls.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act, implemented by Section 951 of the Dodd–Frank Act, require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act.
 
Corporate Structure
 
The Company’s business operations are conducted primarily through ECRC. The below table provides an overview of the Company’s current subsidiaries and their activities.
 

Name | State/Province of Formation | Ownership | Business 
--------------------------+-------------------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
0896800 B.C. Ltd. | British Columbia | 100% by the Company | The only business of 0896800 is to hold the shares of ECRC 
Elk Creek Resources Corp. | Nebraska | 100% by 0896800 | The business of ECRC is the development of the Elk Creek Project

Business Operations
 
NioCorp is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties. NioCorp, through ECRC, is developing a superalloy materials project that, if and when developed, will produce niobium, scandium, and titanium products. Known as the “Elk Creek Project,” it is located near Elk Creek, Nebraska, in the southeast portion of the state.

● | Niobium is used to produce various superalloys that are extensively used in high performance aircraft and jet turbines. It also is used in HSLA steel, a stronger steel used in automotive, bridges, structural systems, buildings, pipelines, and other applications that generally enables those applications to be stronger and lighter in mass. This “lightweighting” benefit often results in environmental benefits, including reduced fuel consumption and material usage, which can result in fewer air emissions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Scandium can be combined with aluminum to make super-high-performance alloys with increased strength and improved corrosion resistance. Scandium also is a critical component of advanced solid oxide fuel cells, an environmentally preferred technology for high-reliability, distributed electricity generation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Titanium is a component of various superalloys and other applications that are used for aerospace applications, weapons systems, protective armor, medical implants and many others. It also is used in pigments for paper, paint, and plastics.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our primary business strategy is to advance our Elk Creek Project to commercial production. We are focused on obtaining additional funds to carry out our near-term planned work programs associated with securing the project financing necessary to complete mine development and construction of the Elk Creek Project.
 
Competitive Business Conditions
 
There is aggressive competition within the minerals industry to discover and acquire mineral properties considered to have commercial potential. We compete for the opportunity to participate in promising exploration projects with other entities. In addition, we compete with others in efforts to obtain financing to acquire and explore mineral properties, acquire and utilize mineral exploration equipment, and hire qualified mineral exploration personnel. We may compete with other mining companies for mining claims in regions adjacent to our existing claims, or in other parts of the world should we dedicate resources to doing so in the future. These companies may be better capitalized than us and we may have difficulty in expanding our holdings through the staking or acquisition of additional mining claims or other mineral tenures.
 
In competing for qualified mineral exploration personnel, we may be required to pay compensation or benefits relatively higher than those paid in the past, and the availability of qualified personnel may be limited in high-demand mining periods, such as was the case in past years when the price of gold and other metals was higher than it is now.
 
Specialized Skill and Knowledge
 
The Company’s ability to continue to progress the Elk Creek Project will depend on its ability to attract and retain individuals with (among other skills) financial, administrative, engineering, geological and mining skills, and knowledge of our industry and targeted markets. Much of the necessary specialized skills and knowledge required by the Company as a mineral exploration company are available from the Company’s current management team and Board of Directors. The Company retains outside consultants if additional specialized skills and knowledge are required.
Cycles
 
The mining business is subject to mineral price cycles. The marketability of minerals and mineral concentrates is also affected by worldwide economic cycles. At the present time, weak demand for some minerals in many countries is suppressing commodity prices, although it is difficult to assess how long such trends may continue. Fluctuations in supply and demand in various regions throughout the world are common.
 
The following table sets forth commodity prices for the last five calendar years for the ferroniobium, scandium trioxide and titanium dioxide products the Company anticipates extracting from its Elk Creek Project. These pricing surveys may not be representative of the pricing that the Company anticipates achieving for its products once commercial production begins from its Elk Creek Project.

As NioCorp’s mining and exploration business is in the exploration stage, and NioCorp has not yet generated any revenue from the operation of the Elk Creek Project, it is not currently significantly affected by changes in commodity demand and prices, except to the extent that same impact the availability of capital for mineral exploration and development projects. As it does not carry on production activities, NioCorp’s ability to fund ongoing exploration is affected by the availability of financing, which is, in turn, affected by the strength of the economy and other general economic factors.
 
Economic Dependence
 
Other than land and mineral right option agreements and the Offtake Agreements, NioCorp’s business is not substantially dependent on any contract such as a contract to sell the major part of its product or services or to purchase the major part of its requirements for goods, services or its raw materials, or any franchise or license or other agreement to use a patent, formula, trade secret, process or trade name upon which its business depends.
Government Regulation
 
The exploration and development of a mining prospect is subject to regulation by a number of federal and state government authorities. These include the EPA and the USACE as well as the various state and local environmental protection agencies. The regulations address many environmental issues relating to air, soil, and water contamination, and apply to many mining related activities including exploration, mine construction, mineral extraction, ore milling, water use, waste disposal, and use of toxic substances. In addition, we are subject to regulations relating to labor standards, occupational health and safety, mine safety, general land use, export of minerals, and taxation. Many of the regulations require permits or licenses to be obtained, the absence of which and/or inability to obtain such permits or licenses will adversely affect our ability to conduct our exploration, development, and operation activities. The failure to comply with the regulations and terms of permits and licenses may result in fines or other penalties or in revocation of a permit or license or loss of a prospect.
General
 
While none of the lands on which the Elk Creek Project is proposed to be built are owned by the U.S. Government, mining rights are governed by the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended, which allows for the location of mining claims on certain federal lands upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and compliance with location requirements. The exploration of mining properties and development and operation of mines is governed by both federal and state laws. Federal laws that govern mining claim location and maintenance and mining operations on federal lands are generally administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Additional federal laws, governing mine safety and health, also apply. State laws also require various permits and approvals before exploration, development or production operations can begin. Among other things, a reclamation plan must typically be prepared and approved, with financial assurance provided in the amount of projected reclamation costs. The financial assurance is used to ensure that proper reclamation takes place and will not be released until that time. Local jurisdictions may also impose permitting requirements, such as conditional use permits or zoning approvals.
Environmental Regulation
 
Our mineral projects are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. The development, operation, closure, and reclamation of mining projects in the U.S. requires numerous notifications, permits, authorizations, and public agency decisions. Compliance with environmental and related laws and regulations requires us to obtain permits issued by regulatory agencies and to file various reports and keep records of our operations. Certain of these permits require periodic renewal or review of their conditions and may be subject to a public review process during which opposition to our proposed operations may be encountered. We are currently operating under various permits for activities connected to mineral exploration, reclamation, and environmental considerations. Our policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Changes to current local, state, or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.
 
Environmental Regulation - U.S. Federal Laws
 
The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and comparable state statutes, impose strict, joint, and several liability on current and former owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the government to file claims requiring clean-up actions and/or demands for reimbursement for government-incurred clean-up costs or natural resource damages. It is also not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance, as well as requirements for corrective actions. CERCLA, RCRA, and comparable state statutes can impose liability for clean-up of sites and disposal of substances found on exploration, mining and processing sites long after activities on such sites have been completed.
 
The Clean Air Act, as amended (“CAA”), restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including mining and processing activities. Any future mining operations by the Company may produce air emissions, including fugitive dust and other air pollutants from stationary equipment, storage facilities, and the use of mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment, which are subject to review, monitoring and/or control requirements under the CAA and state air quality laws. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. In addition, permitting rules may impose limitations on our production levels or result in additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the rules.
 
The National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) requires federal agencies to integrate environmental considerations into their decision-making processes by evaluating the environmental impacts of their proposed actions, including issuance of permits to mining facilities and assessing alternatives to those actions. If a proposed action could significantly affect the environment, the agency must prepare either a detailed statement known as an Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) or a less detailed statement known as an Environmental Assessment (“EA”). The EPA, other federal agencies, and any interested third parties can review and comment on the scope of the EIS or EA and the adequacy of any findings set forth in the draft and final EIS or EA. This process can cause delays in issuance of required permits or result in changes to a project to mitigate its potential environmental impacts, which can in turn impact the economic feasibility of a proposed project.
 
The Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and comparable state statutes, impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into waters of the U.S. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA regulates storm water from mining facilities and requires a storm water discharge permit or Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan for certain activities. Such a permit requires the regulated facility to monitor and sample storm water run-off from its operations. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the U.S. unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal, and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants, and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release.
 
The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program promulgated thereunder, regulate the drilling and operation of subsurface injection wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states and in others the responsibility for the program has been delegated to the state. The program requires that a permit be obtained before drilling a disposal or injection well. Violation of these regulations and/or contamination of groundwater by mining-related activities may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In addition, third-party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.

Environmental Regulation − Nebraska
 
Nebraska has a well-developed set of environmental regulations and responsible agencies but does not have clearly defined regulations with respect to permitting mines. As such, review of the project and the issuance of permits by Nebraska agencies and regulatory bodies could potentially impact the total time to market for our Elk Creek Project. Other Nebraska regulations govern operating and design standards for the construction and operation of any source of air emissions and landfill operations. Any changes to these laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and results of operations by, for example, requiring changes to operating conditions, technical criteria, fees, or surety requirements. The most stringent permit related to air quality is known as a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) Permit, which requires the applicant to demonstrate compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) and Best Available Control Technology (“BACT”) for the control of air emissions. If the facility exceeds the potential to emit thresholds for such a permit and is thus subject to PSD requirements, permanent construction at the project site may not begin until the responsible agency issues the PSD Permit. For facilities in Nebraska with potential emissions below PSD thresholds, a state air construction permit is needed. The state permit also requires a demonstration of compliance with NAAQS but does not require a BACT demonstration and further allows construction at a subject facility to proceed ahead of permit issuance through an established variance process.
Employees
 
As of September 3, 2019, we employed nine (9) full-time employees and one (1) part-time employee.
