Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a surgical robotics company focused on advancing patient care by developing transformative solutions in urology. We develop, manufacture and sell the AquaBeam Robotic System, an advanced, image-guided, surgical robotic system for use in minimally invasive urologic surgery, with an initial focus on treating benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. BPH is the most common prostate disease and impacts approximately 40 million men in the United States. The AquaBeam Robotic System employs a single-use disposable handpiece to deliver our proprietary Aquablation therapy, which combines real-time, multi-dimensional imaging, personalized treatment planning, automated robotics and heat-free waterjet ablation for targeted and rapid removal of prostate tissue. We designed our AquaBeam Robotic System to enable consistent and reproducible BPH surgery outcomes. We believe that Aquablation therapy represents a paradigm shift in the surgical treatment of BPH by addressing compromises associated with alternative surgical interventions. We designed Aquablation therapy to deliver effective, safe and durable outcomes for males suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms, or LUTS, due to BPH that is independent of prostate size and shape, and delivers resection independent of surgeon experience. We have developed a significant and growing body of clinical evidence, which includes nine clinical studies and nearly 150 peer-reviewed publications, supporting the benefits and clinical advantages of Aquablation therapy. As of December 31, 2022, we had an install base of 243 AquaBeam Robotic Systems globally, including 167 in the United States.
BPH refers to the non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland, a small gland in the male reproductive system. The prostate sits underneath the bladder and surrounds the top part of the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder.
 As the prostate enlarges, the gland presses against the urethra, which may obstruct or restrict the flow of urine from the bladder and result in uncomfortable LUTS, such as urgency, frequency, urinary retention, straining to urinate and a weak urinary stream. Without treatment, prolonged obstruction may eventually lead to acute urinary retention, urinary tract infections or renal insufficiency. 
In the United States it is estimated that approximately 40 million men are impacted by BPH, with aging demographics expected to drive future growth. Of these men, approximately 12 million are being managed by a physician for symptoms related to their disease. Our total addressable patient population in the United States includes approximately 8.2 million patients, comprising 6.7 million receiving drug therapy, 1.1 million who have tried but failed drug therapy and 400,000 undergoing surgical intervention each year. Over the next ten years, it is expected that the number of men over 65 years old in the United States will double and include a corresponding increase in the number of men with enlarged prostates. Based on the average selling price of our single-use handpiece, we estimate that our total addressable market opportunity is in excess of $20 billion in the United States. The global incidence of BPH among men over 50 years old is similar to that of the United States, representing a significant incremental market opportunity outside of the United States. 
The main goal of BPH treatment is to alleviate the symptoms associated with the disease and improve the patient’s quality of life. While drug therapy is typically a first line treatment option, limited efficacy and negative side effects contribute to low compliance and high failure rates and drop outs. On the other hand, surgical intervention is proven to provide effective and durable symptom relief compared to drug therapy, but the use of surgery is significantly underpenetrated, largely due to the compromise patients must make between the incidence of irreversible side effects associated with alternative resective surgical interventions, where obstructive tissue is removed at the time of intervention, or the lower rates of efficacy and durability associated with non-resective surgical interventions, where obstructive tissue is not removed, but rather the prostatic urethra is re-shaped. In addition, most alternative surgical interventions are limited by prostate size and shape, with no single procedure capable of effectively addressing the full range of prostate anatomies regardless of surgeon experience level.
We began developing our proprietary AquaBeam Robotic System in 2009 to address many of the shortcomings of alternative surgical interventions by delivering our Aquablation therapy, the first and only image-guided robotic therapy for the treatment of BPH. We believe our Aquablation therapy provides the following unique combination of benefits: 
•Significant and durable symptom relief. Given obstructive prostate tissue is removed during the procedure, Aquablation therapy has demonstrated significant and long-lasting levels of symptom relief similar to those of alternative resective procedures. In our U.S. pivotal trial, Waterjet Ablation Therapy for Endoscopic Resection of prostate tissue, or the WATER study, Aquablation therapy demonstrated superior safety and non-inferior efficacy results compared to transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP, the historical standard of care for the surgical 
treatment of BPH. In the WATER and WATER II studies, surgical retreatment rates were only 5.2% at five years and 3.0% at four years, respectively. In the OPEN WATER study, there were no surgical retreatments at one year. The retreatment rates in the WATER and WATER II studies compare favorably to surgical retreatment rates observed for alternative treatments for BPH. One study published in the BJU International Journal reported on 52,748 men undergoing TURP or photoselective vaporation of the prostate or PVP, with an approximated three-year freedom from surgical retreatment of 92% and 89%, respectively. A second study published in the Journal of Urology reported on 43,041 men undergoing TURP, PVP, enucleation, or open simple prostatectomy with an approximated three-year freedom from surgical retreatment of 93%, 89%, 94%, and 96%, respectively.
•Favorable safety profile. Aquablation therapy has demonstrated low rates of irreversible complications, including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory dysfunction, compared to published rates observed for other resective surgeries. In our WATER study, patients who underwent Aquablation therapy maintained a higher level of sexual function compared to those who underwent TURP.
•Resection independent of prostate size and shape and surgeon experience. We designed Aquablation therapy to deliver outcomes that are effective, safe and durable for males suffering from LUTS due to BPH across all prostate sizes and shapes. Additionally, in the WATER and WATER II studies, 50% and 83% of men, respectively, had an obstructive median lobe, and the average prostate size in each study was 54 ml and 107 ml, respectively. Compared to other resective procedures, we believe Aquablation therapy is relatively simple to learn, enabled by the intuitive user interface of the conformal planning unit, or CPU, and automated robotic resection, and delivers resection that is independent of surgeon experience.
•Personalized treatment planning and improved decision-making. Aquablation therapy combines cystoscopic visualization, which uses a camera attached to a hollow tube, along with ultrasound imaging and advanced planning software to provide the surgeon with a multidimensional view of the treatment area and enable personalized treatment planning for the patient’s unique anatomy, improved decision-making and real-time monitoring during the procedure.
•Targeted and controlled resection with consistent resection times. Aquablation therapy utilizes automated robotic resection to remove prostate tissue using a precise, heat-free waterjet. These features enable targeted and controlled tissue removal with rapid resection times that are highly consistent across prostate sizes and shapes and surgeon experience. 
We have developed a significant and growing body of clinical data that demonstrate the efficacy, safety and durability of Aquablation therapy, with resection that is independent of prostate size and shape and surgeon experience. Our robust body of clinical evidence includes nine clinical studies and nearly 150 peer-reviewed publications. Our WATER study is the only FDA pivotal study randomized against TURP. In this study, Aquablation therapy demonstrated superior safety and non-inferior efficacy compared to TURP across prostate sizes between 30 ml and 80 ml, and superior efficacy in a subset of patients with prostates larger than 50 ml. We have established strong relationships with key opinion leaders or KOLs within the urology community and collaborated with key urological societies in global markets. This support has been instrumental in facilitating broader acceptance and adoption of Aquablation therapy. We believe that as a result of our strong KOL network and our compelling clinical evidence, Aquablation therapy has been added to clinical guidelines of various professional associations, including the American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, Canadian Urological Association, German Urology Society, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. 
In the United States, we sell our products to hospitals. These customers in turn bill various third-party payors, such as commercial payors and government agencies, for reimbursement for the procedures using our products. Effective in 2021, all local Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, which represent 100% of eligible Medicare patients, issued final positive local coverage determinations to provide Medicare beneficiaries with access to Aquablation therapy in all 50 states so long as such beneficiaries meet certain clinical criteria set forth in the local coverage determination. We believe that our strong body of clinical evidence and support from key societies, supplemented by the momentum from Medicare coverage, have led to favorable coverage decisions from many large commercial payors. We plan to leverage these recent successes in our active discussions with commercial payors to establish additional positive national and regional coverage policies, although we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in doing so. Outside of the United States, we have ongoing efforts in key markets to expand established coverage and improve payment which we believe will expand patient access to Aquablation therapy.
We primarily sell our products through our direct sales organization in the United States, which targets urologists across the United States, who we believe represent the primary physician specialty managing the care of patients with BPH. We are initially targeting 860 high-volume hospitals that perform, on average, more than 200 resective procedures annually and account for approximately 70% of all hospital-based resective procedures. Additionally, there are approximately 1,840 
additional U.S. hospitals that perform the remaining 30% of resective BPH procedures we are also targeting. We estimate that approximately 50% of BPH patients who are on drug therapy as well as 50% who have failed drug therapy are under the care of a urologist, equating to approximately 3.9 million men. We believe we can reach these patients by continuing to educate our network of urologists about the clinical benefits of Aquablation therapy, provide comprehensive training programs and deepen our relationships with key urologists and various medical societies. Outside the United States, we sell our products using both our direct sales organization and, in certain regions, our network of distribution partners. 
We generated revenue of $75.0 million and $34.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and incurred a net loss of $87.2 million and $59.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $348.7 million.
Our Success Factors
We believe the continued growth of our company will be driven by the following success factors:
•First and only image-guided, heat-free robotic therapy for BPH that addresses the compromise between safety and efficacy of alternative surgical interventions. We have developed the AquaBeam Robotic System, an advanced, image-guided, surgical robotic system for use in minimally invasive BPH surgery. The AquaBeam Robotic System delivers our Aquablation therapy, the first and only image-guided, robotic therapy for the treatment of BPH. Aquablation therapy combines real-time, multidimensional imaging, personalized treatment planning, automated robotics and heat-free waterjet ablation for targeted and rapid removal of prostate tissue. We believe that alternative surgical interventions for BPH have a number of shortcomings which require patients to compromise between safety and efficacy, either providing significant symptom relief but with a heightened risk of irreversible complications or a lower risk of complications but with significantly less symptom relief. We believe Aquablation therapy represents a paradigm shift in the surgical treatment of BPH by addressing this compromise.
•Large, growing and underpenetrated market opportunity. BPH is the number one reason men visit a urologist and we estimate that approximately 40 million men in the United States alone are impacted by BPH, with aging demographics expected to drive future growth. Of these men, approximately 12 million are being managed by a physician for symptoms related to their disease. While drug therapy is typically a first-line treatment option, limited efficacy and negative side effects, including neurologic, ophthalmic and sexual complications, contribute to low compliance and high failure rates, often as high as 30%. On the other hand, surgical intervention is proven to provide effective and durable symptom relief compared to drug therapy, but the use of surgery is significantly underpenetrated, largely due to the compromise and limitations associated with alternative surgical interventions. Our total addressable patient population in the United States includes approximately 8.2 million patients, comprised of 6.7 million who are receiving drug therapy, 1.1 million who have tried but failed drug therapy and 400,000 who are undergoing surgical intervention each year. Based on the average selling price of our single-use handpiece, we estimate that our total U.S. addressable market opportunity is in excess of $20 billion. The global incidence of BPH among men over 50 years old is similar to that of the United States, representing a significant incremental market opportunity outside of the United States. 
•Significant and growing body of clinical evidence and strong support from key opinion leaders, or KOLs, resulting in the inclusion of Aquablation therapy into societal guidelines and rapid expansion of positive reimbursement coverage policies. We have developed a significant and growing body of clinical data that demonstrates the efficacy, safety and durability of Aquablation therapy, consistent across all prostate sizes and shapes with resection that is independent of surgeon experience. Our robust clinical evidence includes nine clinical studies that we sponsored and enrolled between 2013 and 2018, as well as nearly 150 peer-reviewed publications. Our employees participated in protocol design, data management, monitoring, and statistical analysis in all nine clinical studies and results were provided to authors for publication upon request. Our WATER study is the only FDA pivotal study randomized against TURP, which is the historical standard of care for the surgical treatment of BPH. In this study, Aquablation therapy demonstrated superior safety and non-inferior efficacy results compared to TURP across prostate sizes between 30 ml and 80 ml, and superior efficacy results in a subset of patients with prostates larger than 50 ml. We have established strong relationships with KOLs within the urology community and collaborated with key urological societies in global markets. This support has been instrumental in facilitating broader acceptance and adoption of Aquablation therapy. As a result of our strong KOL network and our compelling clinical evidence, Aquablation therapy has been added to clinical guidelines of various professional associations, including the American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, Canadian Urological Association, German Urology Society, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; has achieved favorable coverage determinations from MACs; and has been designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, as demonstrating substantial clinical improvement over alternative 
surgical interventions and granted transitional pass-through payment status, effective January 1, 2020, which has been extended through December 31, 2023. We believe our compelling clinical evidence, strong KOL relationships and engagement with global urological societies will continue to play an important role in growing awareness and increasing adoption of Aquablation therapy.
•Compelling value proposition and benefits to hospitals, surgeons and patients. We designed our AquaBeam Robotic System to enable consistent and reproducible resections that are independent of surgeon experience and require minimal training. In addition, we believe the differentiated features of Aquablation therapy allow for improved predictability of outcomes and, as such, increase surgeon confidence in recommending surgical intervention to their patients. Given its ability to treat prostate sizes of all shapes and sizes, Aquablation therapy enables hospitals to consolidate the surgical treatment of BPH in a single therapy. We also believe that hospital administrators will be able to leverage the differentiation of Aquablation therapy as a marketing tool to attract skilled surgeons and patients to their hospital system. Furthermore, the AquaBeam Robotic System is highly mobile and compact, requiring no retrofitting of the operating room, and we believe is competitively priced compared to other robotic systems and capital equipment devices, both factors which we believe remove adoption hurdles for hospital customers and allow for a more streamlined hospital sales cycle. For patients, Aquablation therapy offers significant and durable symptom relief with an attractive safety profile. We believe these benefits will continue to support the adoption of Aquablation therapy by hospitals and surgeons.
•Recurring revenue model. We generate revenue primarily from hospitals making capital purchases of our AquaBeam Robotic System and purchasing our single-use handpieces for individual patient use. We also generate revenue by providing post-warranty service for the AquaBeam Robotic System. We believe our business model of selling capital equipment that generates corresponding disposables utilization and post-warranty service contracts provides a path to predictable, recurring revenue. 
•Broad research and development capabilities and a robust intellectual property portfolio. We have invested in establishing strong research and development capabilities for over a decade, including in surgical robotics and imaging-enabled surgery as well as integrating hardware and software to create an exceptional user and patient experience. We believe our focus on this experience will allow us to continue to bring new upgrades, capabilities and products to market, allowing us to innovate and maintain our competitive positioning. We have a broad patent portfolio, including 135 issued patents and 88 pending patent applications as of December 31, 2022. We believe our intellectual property and know-how present a significant barrier to entry for our competitors.
•Proven leadership team and board members with deep industry experience. We are led by a highly experienced management team and board with a successful track record of building businesses by identifying and providing solutions for underserved markets in the medical device industry. Our team has successfully led and managed dynamic growth phases in organizations and commercialized products in markets with established incumbents by addressing the unmet needs of the physicians and patients they serve.
Our Growth Strategies
Our mission is to establish Aquablation therapy as the surgical standard of care for BPH. The key elements of our growth strategy are:
•Grow our installed base of AquaBeam Robotic Systems by driving adoption of Aquablation therapy among urologists. In the United States, we are initially focused on driving adoption of Aquablation therapy among urologists that perform hospital-based resective BPH surgery. We estimate that approximately 290,000 of the 400,000 annual BPH surgeries are resective procedures performed across approximately 2,700 hospitals. We are initially targeting 860 high-volume hospitals that we estimate perform, on average, more than 200 resective procedures annually and account for approximately 70% of all hospital-based resective procedures. . Additionally, there are approximately 1,840 U.S. hospitals that perform the remaining 30% of resective BPH procedures we are also targeting. To penetrate these hospitals, we will continue to increase our direct team of capital sales representatives, who are focused on driving system placement within hospitals by engaging with key surgeons and decision makers to educate them about the compelling value proposition of Aquablation therapy. We also intend to increase awareness of Aquablation therapy by continuing to publish clinical data in various industry and scientific journals, present our clinical data at various industry conferences and sponsor peer-to-peer education programs and proctorships. 
•Increase system utilization by establishing Aquablation therapy as the surgical treatment of choice for BPH. Once we place a system within a hospital, our objective is to establish Aquablation therapy as the surgical treatment of choice for BPH. Within each hospital, we are initially focused on targeting urologists who perform 
medium-to-high volumes of resective procedures and converting their resective cases to Aquablation therapy. To accomplish this, we will continue expanding our team of highly trained Aquablation representatives and clinical specialists, who are focused on driving system utilization within the hospital, providing education and training support and ensuring excellent user experiences. As urologists gain experience with Aquablation therapy, we will leverage their experiences to capture more surgical volumes and establish Aquablation therapy as the surgical standard of care. Over time, we intend to leverage our relationships with urologists to drive utilization of Aquablation therapy beyond the current surgical market. We estimate that approximately 50% of BPH patients who are on drug therapy as well as 50% who have failed drug therapy are under the care of a urologist, equating to approximately 3.9 million men. We believe we can reach these patients by continuing to educate our network of urologists of the clinical benefits of Aquablation therapy, provide comprehensive training programs and deepen our relationships with key urologists and various medical societies. Furthermore, we believe that additional coverage by private payors will continue to drive increased utilization.
•Continue to broaden private payor coverage. Since the addition of Aquablation therapy to AUA clinical guidelines in May 2019, we have significantly grown coverage for Aquablation therapy in the United States. Effective in 2021, all local MACs, which represent 100% of eligible Medicare patients, issued final positive local coverage determinations to provide Medicare beneficiaries with access to Aquablation therapy in all 50 states so long as such beneficiaries meet certain clinical criteria set forth in the local coverage determinations. We believe that these favorable coverage decisions have been a catalyst for hospital adoption of our AquaBeam Robotic System. Our strong body of clinical evidence and support from key societies, supplemented by the momentum from Medicare coverage, have led to favorable coverage decisions from many large private payors. We plan to leverage these recent successes in our active discussions with private payors to establish additional positive national and regional coverage policies. We believe that additional private payor coverage will contribute to increasing utilization of our system over time. Outside of the United States, we have ongoing efforts in key markets to expand established coverage and further improve patient access to Aquablation therapy.
•Build upon our strong base of clinical evidence. We are committed to continuing to build upon our foundation of clinical evidence, which we believe will help drive increased awareness and adoption of our products. For example, we are continuing to follow patients in our WATER and WATER II studies to collect five-year clinical outcomes as well as conducting sub-group analyses across our base of clinical data that we believe will further define the role of Aquablation therapy across patient populations. We also plan to further build our base of clinical evidence by supporting new clinical studies intended to support commercial, regulatory and reimbursement efforts. For example, we are supporting an investigator-initiated clinical study, called WATER III, which is a randomized controlled trial evaluating Aquablation therapy against laser enucleation in treating BPH patients with large prostate sizes.
•Invest in research and development to drive continuous improvements and innovation. We are currently developing additional and next generation technologies to support and improve Aquablation therapy to further satisfy the evolving needs of surgeons and their patients as well as to further enhance the usability and scalability of the AquaBeam Robotic System. We also plan to leverage our treatment data and software development capabilities to integrate artificial intelligence and machine-learning to enable computer-assisted anatomy recognition and improved treatment planning and personalization. In the future, we may evaluate the application of the AquaBeam Robotic System in new urologic conditions beyond BPH.
•Drive increased awareness of Aquablation therapy beyond the urology community. As we expand our network of urologists and grow our installed base, we intend to increase awareness and brand recognition of Aquablation therapy beyond urologists, primarily among primary care physicians who manage BPH patients. We estimate that approximately 3.9 million men, including approximately 3.3 million patients who are on drug therapy and 600,000 who have failed drug therapy, are under the care of a primary care physician. To achieve this objective, we will invest in marketing initiatives directed at primary care physicians in order to expand networks for BPH patients to visit a urologist. Once we have established a broader installed base of systems, we may seek to further increase patient awareness through various direct-to-patient marketing initiatives.
•Further penetrate and expand into existing and new international markets. We plan to establish and strengthen our presence internationally. While the United States remains our primary focus in the near-term, we are growing our existing presence in other markets, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Korea and Japan, by continuing to promote the clinical benefits of Aquablation therapy, supporting investments in clinical studies to improve coverage and reimbursement and fostering relationships with KOLs. We plan to strategically 
invest in new markets based on our assessment of market size and opportunity and prospects for compelling reimbursement.
Market Overview
Our Addressable Market Opportunity in BPH
In the United States, BPH is the number one reason men visit a urologist. BPH is estimated to occur in more than 50% of men in their 50s, growing to 70% of men in their 60s, and is the fourth most common diagnosed disease in men above 50 years old, ranking behind coronary artery disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. BPH often results in uncomfortable LUTS, which can have a significant impact on quality of life. If left untreated, BPH may eventually lead to more serious complications. 
In the United States, we estimate that approximately 40 million men are impacted by symptoms of BPH, with aging demographics expected to drive future growth. Over the next ten years, we expect that the number of men over 65 years old in the United States will double and include a corresponding increase in the number of men with enlarged prostates. Of these men, approximately 12 million are being managed by a physician for symptoms related to their disease. While drug therapy is typically a first line treatment option, limited efficacy and negative side effects contribute to low patient compliance, high failure rates and drop outs. On the other hand, surgical intervention is proven to provide effective and durable symptom relief compared to drug therapy, but the use of surgery is significantly underpenetrated, largely due to the compromise patients must make between (1) the incidence of irreversible side effects associated with current resective surgical interventions, or (2) the lower rates of efficacy and durability associated with non-resective surgical interventions. Our total addressable patient population in the United States includes approximately 8.2 million patients, comprised of 6.7 million receiving drug therapy, 1.1 million who have tried but failed drug therapy and 400,000 undergoing surgical intervention each year. Based on the average selling price of our single-use handpiece, we estimate that our total addressable market opportunity is in excess of $20 billion in the United States. The global incidence of BPH among men over 50 years old is similar to that of the United States, representing a significant incremental market opportunity outside of the United States. 
Overview of the Prostate
The prostate is a small gland in the male reproductive system. The prostate sits underneath the bladder and surrounds the top part of the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder.
The prostate is approximately the size of a walnut in men younger than 30 years old; as men age, the prostate grows larger. At puberty, testosterone levels in boys start to increase and the prostate grows to about eight times its size. The prostate continues to grow, doubling in size between the ages of 21 and 50 years, and almost doubles again in size between the ages of 50 and 80 years. Prostate size is generally measured in volume using milliliters, or ml. 
BPH Disease Overview and Diagnosis
BPH refers to the non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland. As the prostate enlarges, the gland presses against the urethra, which may obstruct or restrict the flow of urine from the bladder and result in uncomfortable LUTS, such as urgency, frequency, urinary retention, straining to urinate and a weak urinary stream. Without treatment, prolonged obstruction may eventually lead to acute urinary retention, urinary tract infections or renal insufficiency.
According to the AUA guidelines, it is estimated that 90% of men between the ages of 45 and 80 will experience LUTS, and 50% of them will experience moderate-to-severe symptoms by the time they are 85 years old, which we believe are predominantly caused by BPH. Furthermore, 50% of men between the ages of 51-60 have pathological BPH. According to our internal marketing survey, 99% of men diagnosed with BPH say symptoms impact their quality of life. 
Clinical diagnosis of BPH typically involves a number of tests that are used to assess the degree of LUTS and determine whether the symptoms are caused by BPH or another condition. LUTS are classified as either mild, moderate or severe. Patients suffering from symptoms of BPH are typically first seen by a primary care physician, who may diagnose and manage the patient, or refer the patient to a urologist. Urologists are trained to perform surgery for various types of urologic conditions, including BPH. 
BPH Treatment Options
The main goal of BPH treatment is to alleviate the symptoms associated with the disease and improve the patient’s quality of life. As such, a patient’s recommended course of treatment is largely based on the patient’s degree of symptoms. 
Patients who choose this approach are generally advised to implement lifestyle changes and return for yearly visits with their physician to determine if symptoms are changing. For most men, the prostate will continue to grow and symptoms will worsen. As symptoms become more bothersome, active treatment may be recommended. The two primary categories of active treatment for BPH are drug therapy and surgical intervention.
Drug Therapy
Drug therapy is often the first step in actively treating mild-to-moderate symptoms of BPH. While there is no pharmacological cure for BPH, drugs may be used to manage symptoms. Without surgical intervention, most men with BPH who start drug therapy will need to continue it indefinitely in order to relieve symptoms. While drug therapy can provide relief for some men, two out of three patients are not satisfied with the effectiveness of their medication. Drug therapy is also often associated with negative side effects, including headaches, dizziness, nausea, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, loss of libido, cardiac failure and dementia. These side effects often contribute to poor treatment compliance, with drug therapy failing in up to 30% of men within two years. Furthermore, drug therapy may be costly, particularly in light of limited symptom relief. 
Surgical Intervention
Surgical intervention is recommended for patients who have failed or are unwilling to consider drug therapy, or are suffering from complications due to their BPH. Although more invasive than drug therapy, surgical intervention generally provides more significant, longer-lasting symptom relief. We believe that growth in the use of surgical intervention over the past several years is due to the introduction of new technologies that better balance the compromise between efficacy and safety as well as growing awareness of surgical intervention as an effective way to manage BPH symptoms compared to drug therapy. 
There are two categories of surgical intervention, resective, where obstructive tissue is removed at the time of intervention, and non-resective, where obstructive tissue is not removed, but rather the prostatic urethra is re-shaped. 
Resective Procedures
Resective prostate procedures generally provide more significant and longer-lasting symptom relief than non-resective procedures, but may result in a higher incidence of irreversible complications, including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory dysfunction.
Resective surgeries may be performed endoscopically, allowing the procedure to be completed through a tubular instrument, or via an open or a laparoscopic procedure, called a simple prostatectomy. 
Endoscopic procedures access the prostate through the urethra, so no incisions are made in the patient’s abdomen. Common alternative endoscopic resective procedures include:
•Transurethral Resection of the Prostate. TURP is a resective procedure which uses electrocautery to cut and remove prostate tissue. Despite being used for almost a century, this procedure is still the most frequently performed resective surgery and is considered the historical standard of care for the surgical treatment of BPH for prostates less than 80 ml.
•Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate, or PVP. PVP is a transurethral form of treatment that utilizes a laser fiber to vaporize prostate tissue sequentially outwards until the surgeon creates a sufficient cavity through which the patient may now void. PVP is generally used in patients with small- to average-sized prostates and can be used in patients who are at high risk of bleeding complications. 
•Laser Enucleation of the Prostate. Laser enucleation utilizes a surgical laser to manually resect prostate tissue through the urethra. This procedure allows the surgeon to follow anatomic planes to separate entire lobes of the prostate. In general, separated prostate lobes are then pushed into the bladder and suctioned out via a special tool. Laser enucleation is prostate size-independent; however, this procedure is more commonly used in larger prostates, and adoption has been limited due to the high degree of skill and experience required. 
A simple prostatectomy is an invasive, open procedure that requires one or more incisions to be made in the patient’s abdomen to access and remove part or all of the prostate. This procedure is typically a last resort treatment for BPH in patients with very large prostates or those patients with severe complications due to BPH. This surgery may be done manually, or with the assistance of a robot, but in either case is a procedure that requires a high degree of surgeon skill.
Non-Resective Procedures
In non-resective procedures, prostate tissue is not removed at the time of surgery. By not removing tissue, symptom relief is generally less significant and durable compared to resective procedures. The two most common commercially available non-resective procedures are prostatic urethral lift, or PUL, and water vapor therapy. PUL uses permanent implants of nitinol and stainless steel placed transurethrally to pin back and compress obstructing prostate tissue, thus creating a channel for improved urinary flow. Water vapor therapy utilizes principles of convection by transurethrally delivering water vapor into obstructing prostate tissue, which results in cell death and reduction of prostate volume over a period of three to six months. Non-resective procedures are generally approved for small- to average-sized prostates. 
Limitations of Alternative Surgical Interventions
Two factors that surgeons and patients commonly consider when evaluating surgical intervention are efficacy and safety. Efficacy is generally measured by symptom relief as well as durability of relief, and safety by the occurrence of irreversible complications such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory dysfunction. We believe that alternative surgical interventions for BPH require patients to compromise between efficacy and safety. Alternative interventions either provide significant symptom relief with a heightened risk of irreversible complications or a lower risk of complications with significantly less symptom relief. In addition, most alternative surgical interventions are limited by prostate size and shape, with no single procedure capable of effectively addressing the full range of prostate anatomies regardless of surgeon experience level. We believe that the compromise and limitations associated with alternative surgical interventions have contributed to the relatively low penetration rate of surgical intervention. 
Limitations of Endoscopic Resective Procedures
While endoscopic resective surgeries such as TURP and laser-based procedures may provide BPH patients with durable symptom relief, these procedures have a number of limitations, including:
•High rates of irreversible complications. Irreversible complications are a common side effect of endoscopic resective procedures. Published studies have shown rates of erectile dysfunction as high as 14%, 20% and 8%, ejaculatory dysfunction as high as 89%, 50% and 77%, and incontinence as high as 2%, 2%, and 33% for TURP, PVP and laser enucleation, respectively. We believe the high rates of irreversible complications are in large part due to these technologies utilizing heat to remove prostate tissue, which may lead to unintended thermal damage to critical parts of the anatomy. Furthermore, minimal intraoperative visualization, which is generally limited to a cystoscope, provides limited visibility of the prostate and makes it difficult for the surgeon to see and preserve critical parts of the prostate during tissue resection. This results in highly variable depth of tissue penetration, damage to tissue which may extend deeper than cavity created, a potential for unintended prostate capsule perforation, potential damage to nerve bundle responsible for erectile function, and delayed healing of prostatic urethra.
•Prostate size limitations. While TURP is considered the standard of care for surgical treatment of BPH, it is generally reserved for small- to average-sized prostates below 80 ml given the length and manual nature of the procedure. For laser-based therapies, PVP is also most commonly used for small- to average-sized prostates, while laser enucleation is generally reserved for treating patients with larger prostates.
•Experience dependent outcomes and long learning curves. Endoscopic resective procedures rely on manual resection of the prostate, with clinical outcomes often highly dependent on the surgeon’s experience level. For example, a study of a large number of patients undergoing TURP found that the rate of reoperation was 1.2-fold higher in men treated by surgeons who had performed 172 or fewer TURP procedures versus surgeons that had performed more than 402 TURP procedures. In addition, a study of 200 procedures by a surgeon performing PVP showed that the surgeon required at least 120 procedures to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. Furthermore, a study of surgeons learning to perform laser enucleation demonstrated that one-third of the surgeons failed to complete the training program. 
•Inconsistent and lengthy resection times. Endoscopic resective procedures require manual resection of prostate tissue performed under limited visualization. This manual process contributes to highly inconsistent and lengthy resection times that are strongly correlated with prostate size.
Limitations of a Simple Prostatectomy
While a simple prostatectomy typically provides maximum symptom relief by removing part or all of the prostate gland, this procedure is generally considered a treatment of last resort reserved for patients with large prostates. Limitations of a simple prostatectomy include:
•Surgical safety concerns. Even when performed robotically, a simple prostatectomy still requires incisions to be made in the patient’s abdomen in order to access the prostate gland. Bleeding events are a key risk in these types of procedures, with transfusion rates as high as 25%.
•High rates of irreversible complications. Similar to endoscopic resective procedures, open procedures commonly result in high rates of irreversible complications, with studies showing erectile, ejaculatory dysfunction and incontinence rates as high as 2-3%, 90% and 8%, respectively.
•Long hospital stay and recovery time. Given the invasiveness of open procedures, long hospital stays and post-procedure recovery are common. In addition, patients typically stay in the hospital for an average of five days after surgery and have long recovery times.
Limitations of Non-Resective Procedures
While non-resective procedures are associated with favorable safety profiles and limited impact on sexual function, these procedures generally deliver lower and less durable symptom relief than resective procedures. Limitations of non-resective procedures include:
•Limited symptom relief and durability. By not removing obstructive prostate tissue, non-resective procedures generally results in less significant and durable symptom relief compared to resective procedures. In addition, since prostate tissue continues to grow over time, durability of symptom relief is typically less favorable in non-resective procedures, with higher rates of patients needing to undergo surgical retreatment or go back on drugs. For example, five-year surgical retreatment rates for PUL and water vapor therapy were 13.6% and 4.4%, respectively. In addition, the rates of PUL and water vapor therapy patients back on drug therapy at five years were 10.7% and 11.1%, respectively. Furthermore, since PUL requires the use of a permanent implant, there is risk of post-operative complications due to the implant which may require implant removal, with a published five-year rate of implant removal of 9.3%.
•Limited intraoperative visualization. Similar to endoscopic resective procedures, the surgeon’s view of the prostate in endoscopic non-resective procedures is limited to a cystoscope that provides minimal visibility of the prostate.
•Prostate size and shape limitations. Both PUL and water vapor therapy are generally used for small- to average-sized prostates. Unlike any of the resective procedures, both of these procedures are specifically limited by the FDA for use in certain prostate sizes. The mean prostate volumes for PUL and water vapor therapy were 45 ml and 46 ml, respectively, in their respective U.S. pivotal, prospective, randomized clinical trials. In addition, the use of these procedures may be limited for certain complex prostate shapes.
Our Solution
We have developed the AquaBeam Robotic System, an advanced, image-guided, surgical robotic system for use in minimally invasive urologic surgery. Our proprietary AquaBeam Robotic System delivers our Aquablation therapy, the first and only image-guided robotic therapy for the treatment of BPH. We market the AquaBeam Robotic System in the United States pursuant to FDA 510(k) clearance that we received in March 2021. The most common side effects observed for Aquablation therapy are mild and transient and may include mild pain or difficulty when urinating, discomfort in the pelvis, blood in the urine, inability to empty the bladder or a frequent or urgent need to urinate, and bladder or urinary tract infection. During our clinical studies, we documented a rate of incontinence between 0%-2%, ejaculatory dysfunction between 6.9%-24.6%, and a peri-operative transfusion rate between 0.9%-5.9%. Since then, a number of publications have reported on transfusion rates. A key study published in April 2021 of 2,089 men undergoing Aquablation therapy with prostates ranging in size from 20 ml to 363 ml observed a transfusion rate of only 0.8%.
The AquaBeam Robotic System combines the following highly differentiated features that are intended to deliver effective, safe and durable outcomes for males suffering from LUTS due to BPH that are consistent across all prostate sizes and shapes and resection independent of surgeon experience:
•Real-time image guidance. Intraoperative ultrasound imaging combined with cystoscopic visualization, which provides a multidimensional view of the treatment area, enabling improved decision-making and real-time treatment monitoring. 
•Personalized treatment planning. Using ultrasound imaging integrated with advanced planning software, the surgeon is able to map the treatment contour that precisely targets the resection area, personalizing the optimal tissue removal plan based on each patient’s unique anatomy. 
•Automated robotic execution. Once the treatment plan is finalized, the robot automatically executes the plan, guiding the precisely calibrated waterjet with speed and accuracy while the surgeon monitors.
•Heat-free waterjet resection. Utilizing the unique power of a pulsating waterjet near the speed of sound, Aquablation therapy removes prostatic tissue with a heat-free waterjet, minimizing the risk of complications arising from prolonged thermal injury.
Components of the AquaBeam Robotic System
The AquaBeam Robotic System is highly mobile and compact, requiring no retrofitting of the operating room. The main components of the AquaBeam Robotic System are the conformal planning unit, or CPU, console, motorpack and handpiece with integrated scope. 
The CPU serves as the primary user interface of the AquaBeam Robotic System, displaying live transrectal ultrasound, or TRUS, video which allows the surgeon to visualize the prostate and surrounding structures, identify key anatomical markers and personalize the resection based on the patient’s unique anatomy. Through an intuitive user interface, the CPU allows the surgeon to map the contour of the prostate and plan the resection pathway by selecting the resection angles, length and depth. During the procedure, the surgeon utilizes the CPU to observe the progress of the resection in real time and has the option to make adjustments to the treatment area as needed. 
The console contains a high-pressure pumping system that is responsible for generating the high-velocity waterjet used in Aquablation therapy. The console interfaces with both the CPU and motorpack and handpiece assembly, generating the water flow rates based on instructions received from the CPU. The console is activated by a foot pedal and has a small screen that displays the pump level and procedure mode.
The motorpack is connected to the console with a flexible cable that provides power and control instructions to the motorpack. The motorpack consists of a motor control system that drives the movement and position of the waterjet nozzle in the handpiece. The motorpack has buttons that allow a surgeon to manually increase or decrease the pump power level during resection, if needed.
The handpiece is the sterile, single-use component of the AquaBeam Robotic System that delivers the high-velocity waterjet. The tip of the handpiece is inserted transurethrally into the patient, advanced through the prostatic urethra into the bladder and positioned using both TRUS imaging and cystoscopic guidance from the integrated, reusable scope. 
The AquaBeam Robotic System also includes a customized ultrasound set through which ultrasound images are integrated with our system.
Key Benefits of Aquablation Therapy
We believe our Aquablation therapy addresses the compromise between safety and efficacy of alternative surgical interventions, providing the following unique benefits:
•significant and durable symptom relief;
•favorable safety profile compared to other BPH resective procedures;
•outcomes consistent across all prostate sizes and shapes and resection independent of surgeon experience;
•personalized treatment planning and improved decision-making; and
•targeted and controlled resection with consistent resection times. 
Our Clinical Results and Studies
A significant body of clinical evidence supports the efficacy, safety and durability of Aquablation therapy across prostate sizes and shapes as well as surgeon experience. This robust body of evidence includes more than 150 peer-reviewed publications in premier journals, such as the Journal of Urology, European Urology and BJU International, as well as nine clinical studies, including our three core studies: WATER, WATER II and OPEN WATER. 
•WATER. The WATER study was double-blind, randomized, controlled study of Aquablation therapy against TURP in men with prostate sizes between 30 ml and 80 ml. This study is the only FDA pivotal trial for BPH randomized against TURP. The study was designed with 80% power to show superiority in safety and more than 80% power to show non-inferiority in efficacy. The results of our WATER study served as the basis for FDA grant of our De Novo request and were first published in the Journal of Urology in 2018. 
•WATER II. The WATER II study was a prospective, multicenter study of Aquablation therapy in patients with prostate sizes between 80 ml and 150 ml. The study was designed with 80% power for safety and 99% power for efficacy against an objective performance criteria, or OPC, based upon TURP data, even though TURP procedures are typically performed in smaller prostates. The results of the WATER II study served as the basis for increased reimbursement and coverage and were first published in BJU International in 2019.
•OPEN WATER. The OPEN WATER study was a prospective, multicenter, all-comer study conducted in a commercial setting spanning patients with prostate sizes between 20 ml and 150 ml. Due to the size of this study, it was sufficiently powered to statistical conclusions with the data. There was no OPC established for this study. The results of the OPEN WATER study were first published in Journal of Clinical Medicine in 2020.
Sales and Marketing
Commercial Activities in the United States
We designed our commercial strategy and built our direct sales team to target primarily urologists across the United States, who we believe represent the primary physician specialty managing the care of patients with BPH. We estimate that there are approximately 12,000 urologists who manage approximately 4.3 million BPH patients, comprised of 400,000 undergoing BPH surgery annually, 3.3 million who are on drug therapy and 600,000 who have tried but failed drug therapy. We are first focused on driving adoption of Aquablation therapy among urologists who perform hospital-based 
BPH resective surgery. We estimate that approximately 290,000 of the 400,000 annual BPH surgeries are resective procedures performed across approximately 2,700 hospitals. We are initially targeting 860 high-volume hospitals that perform, on average, more than 200 resective procedures annually and account for approximately 70% of all hospital-based resective procedures. Additionally, there are approximately 1,840 U.S. hospitals that perform the remaining 30% of resective BPH procedures we are also targeting Within each hospital, we are focused on targeting urologists who perform medium-to-high volumes of resective procedures and converting their resective cases to Aquablation therapy. As urologists gain experience with Aquablation therapy, we will leverage their experiences to capture more surgical volumes and establish Aquablation therapy as the surgical standard of care. We also intend to leverage our relationships with urologists to drive utilization of Aquablation therapy beyond the current surgical market. 
Our direct sales organization actively engages with providers to drive awareness, adoption and utilization of our Aquablation therapy. This team is supported by clinical specialists and professional education employees, who are responsible for training and supporting surgeons, reimbursement specialists, who are responsible for customer and physician education on coding, coverage and payment, and field service employees, who provide preventative maintenance and support for our customers. We intend to expand the size of our direct sales organization to support our efforts for adoption and utilization of Aquablation therapy.
In addition to our direct sales efforts, we support our sales organization with marketing and market development initiatives. We plan to continue to expand and enhance our marketing capabilities to support our growing commercial organization and customer base. Our near-term marketing efforts center principally on increasing awareness and driving adoption of Aquablation therapy among urologists by continuing to publish clinical data in various industry and scientific journals, present our clinical data at various industry conferences, expand our network of KOLs and sponsor peer-to-peer education programs and proctorships. We believe these initiatives will further deepen our relationships with urologists and key medical societies, contributing to our goal of Aquablation therapy becoming the surgical standard of care for BPH surgery. Longer-term, as we expand our network of urologists and grow our installed base, we intend to increase awareness and brand recognition of Aquablation therapy beyond urologists, primarily among primary care physicians who manage BPH patients. To achieve this objective, we will invest in marketing initiatives directed at primary care physicians in order to expand networks for BPH patients to visit a urologist. Once we have established a broader installed base of systems, we may seek to further increase patient awareness through various direct-to-patient marketing initiatives.
Commercial Activities Outside of the United States
Our commercialization strategy outside the United States is focused on large addressable markets through a broad range of market development activities, including increasing awareness, obtaining regulatory approvals and establishing reimbursement. We sell our products using both our direct sales organization and, in certain regions, our network of distribution partners. 
In EMEA, our direct sales organization is currently primarily focused on Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Austria. In other countries, such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, Israel, and South Korea, we engage distribution partners to assist us with market development and sales activities. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 16 personnel to support sales and marketing activities in EMEA. We will opportunistically choose distribution partners with clinical and marketing expertise to enter new markets. We are focused on distribution partners that have the capability to assist with surgeon training and, when required, obtaining regulatory approvals. In the Asia-Pacific region, we are focused on obtaining local regulatory clearances with the assistance of our distribution partners in this region. We have regulatory approval in Hong Kong, where we are engaged with a distribution partner for market development activities. We also have regulatory approval in Japan, and are currently evaluating our commercial strategy while conducting a post market survey as a condition to our regulatory approval.
Third-Party Reimbursement
In the United States, we sell our products to hospitals. These customers in turn bill various third-party payors, such as commercial payors and government agencies, for reimbursement for the procedures using our products. Our market access team includes five professionals who are focused on all key aspects of reimbursement, which include securing appropriate coding, payment and coverage policies for our products and procedures using our products. This team focuses both on payer engagement as well as providing support to the providers.
Coverage and reimbursement by governmental and third-party payors may depend upon a number of factors, including the determination that the product or service and its use or administration for a particular patient is:
•a covered benefit;
•safe, effective and medically necessary;
•appropriate for the specific patient;
•supported by guidelines established by the relevant professional societies;
•cost-effective; and
•neither experimental nor investigational.
Third-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular products. In addition, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for procedures exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for procedures can differ significantly from payor to payor. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement can be a time-consuming process that could require supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data.
Payors continually review new and existing technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny or reverse coverage for new or existing products and procedures. Further, future coverage and reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions, such as additional prior authorization requirements, both in the United States and in international markets. In addition, Medicare Administrative Contractors could issue a local coverage determination decision that could restrict the patients eligible for a treatment with our products. Third-party coverage and reimbursement may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets. Further, other BPH treatments may be more widely covered or subject to different co-pay policies and requirements, which could impact demand for our products.
Coding and Payment
Third-party payors require physicians and hospitals to identify the service for which they are seeking reimbursement by using Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes, which are created and maintained by the American Medical Association, or AMA. The surgical treatment of BPH using Aquablation therapy is described by CPT code 0421T, which is the code describing transurethral waterjet ablation of the prostate, a Category III code published by the AMA in January 2017. In February 2021, the AMA approved an extension for CPT code 0421T through December 31, 2026.  
Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a defined fee schedule, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, through which payment amounts are determined by the relative values of the professional service rendered. Physician payment rates for Category III codes are determined by the MACs and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The payment to the surgeon using CPT code 0421T is currently similar to that for a TURP procedure.
In addition to payment to the surgeon for professional services, Medicare provides reimbursement to our hospital customers for procedures under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system, or HOPPS, and inpatient prospective payment system, or IPPS. The HOPPS and IPPS provide bundled amounts generally intended to reimburse the hospital for all facility costs related to procedures performed in the hospital outpatient setting and inpatient setting, respectively. Medicare also provides reimbursement for procedures performed in ASCs. Reimbursement rates from commercial payors vary depending on the commercial payor, contract terms, and other factors.
As part of the 2020 Outpatient Prospective Payment System ruling, the CMS granted approval for a transitional pass-through, or TPT, payment for Aquablation therapy. TPT status is intended to encourage the use of newly FDA-approved medical devices, drugs, and biologics across all fields of medicine and to boost Medicare patients’ access to these innovative therapies by temporarily paying more than established facility fees. The TPT payment for Aquablation therapy has been extended through December 31, 2023.
Commercial Payor and Government Program Coverage
A core pillar of our reimbursement strategy involves broadening our third-party payor coverage. We continue to have active discussions with commercial payors to establish positive national coverage policies by highlighting our compelling and robust clinical data, increased patient demand and support from leading medical societies and key opinion leaders.  
As of December 27, 2020, all MACs cover procedures involving Aquablation therapy are covered for Medicare patients (including Medicare Advantage plans). We believe Medicare accounts for approximately 50% of all hospital-based resective BPH procedures performed in the United States.  
Prior Authorization Approval Process
For certain customers, our reimbursement strategy includes leveraging our market access team as advisors when needed to support in obtaining appropriate prior authorization approvals in advance of treatment. We believe we are highly effective in providing guidance to obtain prior authorizations when needed.
Reimbursement Outside of the United States
Outside of the United States, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country, and within some countries by region, as well as by payor type. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government sponsors, hospital budgets or private health insurance plans, or combinations thereof. Obtaining reimbursement is a key part of our market development strategy outside of the United States. We currently have established reimbursement in Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. Spain and Italy are continuing to establish new, as well as more favorable, reimbursement. Additionally, following Japanese regulatory approval, we are currently conducting a post market survey as a condition to our regulatory approval.
Research and Development
We have established a dedicated research and development team with strong capabilities in surgical robotics and imaging-enabled surgery as well as integrating hardware and software to create an exceptional user and patient experience. We believe our focus on this experience will allow us to continue to bring new upgrades, capabilities and products to market, allowing us to innovate and maintain our competitive positioning. 
To improve customer experience, we are continually innovating our technologies to support and improve Aquablation therapy to further satisfy the evolving needs of surgeons and their patients as well as to further enhance the usability and scalability of the AquaBeam Robotic System. We also plan to leverage our treatment data and software development capabilities to enable artificial intelligence assisted anatomy recognition and improved treatment planning and personalization. In the future, we may evaluate the application of the AquaBeam Robotic System in new urologic conditions beyond BPH.
Manufacturing and Supply
We directly manufacture the AquaBeam Robotic System, the handpiece and other accessories at our facility in Redwood City, California. This includes supporting the supply chain distribution and logistics of the various components. Components, sub-assemblies and services required to manufacture our products are purchased from numerous global suppliers. Each AquaBeam Robotic System is shipped to our customers with a third-party manufactured ultrasound system and probes. We utilize a well-known third-party logistics provider located in United States and the Netherlands to ship our products to our customers globally. We rely on third-party suppliers, almost all of whom are single source suppliers, to provide us with certain components, sub-assemblies and materials for our products. Currently our principal suppliers include Shantou Institute of Ultrasonic Instruments Co. Ltd. (which manufactures our transrectal ultrasound set), Myriad Fiber Imaging Tech., Inc. (which manufactures our integrated scope), HydroCision, Inc. (which manufactures our pump cartridge), and Medical Targeting Technologies GmbH (which manufactures our articulating arms). Our suppliers manufacture the components they produce for us and test our components and devices to our specifications. We have entered into manufacturing and supply agreements with several of our single-source suppliers pursuant to which they supply the components we need. In addition, we intend to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to enable us to continue our operations while we obtain another supplier in the event that one or more of our single-source suppliers were to encounter a delay in supply or end supply. 
Competition
The industry in which we operate is subject to rapid change from the introduction of new products and technologies and other activities of industry participants. While we believe Aquablation therapy and the AquaBeam Robotic System provide us with a competitive advantage against other competing BPH treatment modalities, our currently marketed products are, and any future products we commercialize will be, subject to intense competition.
Certain of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, regulatory approval, promotion, sale and support of their products. Our competitors may also have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we do, including relationships with our potential customers. In addition, many of these companies have longer operating histories and greater brand recognition than we do. Additionally, many of these companies have overcome reimbursement barriers and their procedures are covered by nearly all major insurance carriers. 
Because of the size of the BPH market, we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products.
We consider our primary competition to be resective surgical treatments. These include among others, those manufacturers producing devices for the TURP procedure and laser-based therapies marketed by Boston Scientific Corporation. We also believe we will eventually compete with non-resective and non-surgical treatments. The non-resective treatments include, among others, UroLift marketed by Teleflex Incorporated and Rezum marketed by Boston Scientific Corporation. Non-surgical treatments for BPH are primarily pharmaceuticals. 
We believe that the primary basis on which we compete include:
•improved outcomes for patients;
•product safety, efficacy, reliability and durability;
•quality and volume of clinical data;
•effective marketing to and education of patients, physicians and hospitals;
•company, product and brand recognition;
•sales force experience and access;
•product support and service;
•technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation;
•pricing and revenue strategies;
•effectiveness of reimbursement teams and strategies
•regulatory status and speed to market; and
•dedicated clinical representatives.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors in regard to any one or all of these factors.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had rights to 42 issued U.S. patents, expiring between 2028 and 2040, 93 issued foreign patents, expiring between 2028 and 2038, 35 pending U.S. patent applications, four pending PCT applications, and 55 foreign patent applications.

There is no active patent litigation involving any of our patents and we have not received any notices of patent infringement.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 36 pending and registered trademark filings worldwide, some of which may provide trademark protection in multiple countries.
We also rely, in part, upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may in the future rely upon licensing opportunities, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality and assignment agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information.
Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot assure you that any current or subsequently issued patents will protect our intellectual property rights or provide us with any competitive advantage. While there is no active litigation involving any of our patents or other intellectual property rights and we have not received any notices of patent infringement, we may be required to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights against third parties in the future. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property Matters” for additional information regarding these and other risks related to our intellectual property portfolio and their potential effect on us.
License Agreement with AquaBeam
In 2008, we assigned to AquaBeam LLC, or AquaBeam, certain provisional patent applications, or AquaBeam Patent Applications, which have since issued as patents, and any future patent applications that claim priority to the AquaBeam Patent Applications, or AquaBeam Patents. 
In September 2019, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement, or the AquaBeam License Agreement, with AquaBeam. Pursuant to the AquaBeam License Agreement, AquaBeam granted us a worldwide, exclusive (even as to AquaBeam), sublicensable, royalty-free license under the AquaBeam Patents and to all other patent rights owned by AquaBeam, that claim certain technology related to delivering energy to tissues by directing a liquid fluid stream, or together with AquaBeam Patents, Licensed Patents, in the field of urology, or Field. Pursuant to the AquaBeam License Agreement, and subject to the terms therein, we granted AquaBeam a worldwide, exclusive (even as to us), sublicensable, royalty-free license under certain of our patents rights until October 2021, that claim certain technology related to delivering energy to tissues by directing a liquid fluid stream, or PROCEPT Patents, outside the Field. No payments (except for patent prosecution and maintenance costs) have been made or are otherwise required under the AquaBeam License Agreement.
The AquaBeam License Agreement will remain in full force and effect on a country-by-country basis until the last to expire of the Licensed Patents and the PROCEPT Patents in such country. The expiration date of the last-to-expire of the Licensed Patents and PROCEPT Patents will not be earlier than 2037. The AquaBeam License Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of uncured material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days (or 30 days for payment related breaches), or bankruptcy of the other party.
License Agreement with HydroCision
We are party to a Confidential Exclusive Patent License and Covenant Not To Sue, or the HydroCision License Agreement, with HydroCision, Inc., or HydroCision. Pursuant to the HydroCision License Agreement, HydroCision granted us a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free license to certain patents related to fluid jet technology in the field of urology, or the Fluid Jet Technology Patents and related know-how and documentation. HydroCision also granted us a non-exclusive license to patents allowing us to make, sell, import, export, or otherwise dispose of products made using the Fluid Jet Technology Patents. 
In exchange for the license from HyrdoCision, we paid HydroCision $2,500,000. No further payments have been made or are otherwise required under the HydoCision License Agreement. HydroCision is responsible for all patent prosecution and maintenance costs related to the Fluid Jet Technology Patents. 
The HydoCision License Agreement will remain in full force and effect until the last to expire of the Fluid Jet Technology Patents. The expiration date of the last-to-expire of the Fluid Jet Technology Patents will not be earlier than 2039.
Government Regulation
Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities outside the United States. Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
In addition to United States regulations, we are subject to a variety of regulations outside the United States governing clinical trials and the commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we have or are required to obtain FDA clearance or approval for a product, we will be required to obtain authorization before commencing clinical trials and to obtain marketing authorization or approval of our products under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials or commercialize our products in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or PMA approval. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or another commercially available device that was cleared to through the 510(k) process.
Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.

Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure.
This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) pre-market notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the 
device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo request. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the de novo request if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
Our currently marketed AquaBeam Robotic System is a Class II device, which was initially granted marketing authorization pursuant to a de novo classification. We have subsequently received FDA clearance of a 510(k) pre-market notification for modifications to the AquaBeam Robotic System where we used the initially authorized device as the predicate device for our more recent 510(k) clearance.
PMA Approval Pathway
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a preapproval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR.
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA or de novo request and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing 
impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may impose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
Post-Market Regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information; 
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of a supplement for certain modifications to PMA devices; 
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; 
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
•complying with the new federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers, or UDI, on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database; 
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and 
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR or other applicable regulatory requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
•recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; 
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; 
•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; 
•refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or 
•criminal prosecution.
California Regulation
The State of California requires that we obtain a license to manufacture medical devices. In accordance with the State of California regulations, our license to manufacture is renewed annually with any updated manufacturing information. Although the State of California has announced the suspension of routine periodic inspections, there can be no assurance that the State of California will not resume such inspections or conduct such inspections under specific circumstances that are not yet known.
Regulation of Medical Devices Outside the United States
In order for us to market our products in countries outside the United States, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations in other countries. These regulations, such as requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, will vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes that are significantly longer than United States regulatory approval. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and meet all the local requirements (including language and specific safety 
standards) in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to fines.
Regulation of Medical Devices, European Economic Area (“EEA”)
There is currently no premarket government of medical devices in the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland). However, all medical devices placed on the market in the EEA must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I of Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices, or the Medical Devices Directive, and the regulations laid down in the 2017/745, or the Medical Device Regulations. There is also a directive specifically addressing Active Implantable Medical Devices (Directive 90/385/EEC). The most fundamental essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment, and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter. Compliance with a standard developed to implement an essential requirement also creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body. Notified bodies are often separate entities and are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by government authorities. The notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EEA. Once the product has been placed on the market in the EEA, the manufacturer must comply with requirements for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with the medical device.
In order to demonstrate safety and efficacy for their medical devices, manufacturers must conduct clinical investigations in accordance with the requirements of Annex X to the Medical Devices Directive, Annex 7 of the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive, and applicable European and International Organization for Standardization standards, as implemented or adopted in the EEA member states. Clinical trials for medical devices usually require the approval of an ethics review board and approval by or notification to the national regulatory authorities. Both regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of serious adverse event reports during a study and may request a copy of the final study report.
On May 25, 2017 the new Medical Devices Regulation, or 2017/745 or MDR, was adopted by the European Parliament, which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Following its entry into application on May 26, 2021, the MDR will introduce substantial changes to the obligations with which medical device manufacturers must comply in the EU. High risk medical devices will be subject to additional scrutiny during the conformity assessment procedure. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member states, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member state laws implementing them, in all EEA member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.
On the effective date, May 26, 2021, the new regulations, among other things:
•strengthened the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; 
•established explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; 
•improved the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; 
•set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; 
•strengthened rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of:
•design, development, manufacturing and testing; 
•product standards; 
•product safety; 
•product safety reporting; 
•marketing, sales and distribution;
•packaging and storage requirements; 
•labeling requirements; 
•content and language of instructions for use; 
•clinical trials; 
•record keeping procedures; 
•advertising and promotion; 
•recalls and field corrective actions; 
•post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury; 
•import and export restrictions; 
•tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements; 
•registration for reimbursement; and 
•necessity of testing performed in country by distributors for licensees.
The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
We expect this revised regulation to include further controls and requirements on the following activities:
•high level of request for premarket clinical evidence for high risk devices; 
•increased scrutiny of technical files for implantable devices; 
•monitoring of notified bodies, by independent auditors; 
•increased requirements regarding vigilance and product traceability (specifically related to labeling requirements); and 
•increased regulation for non-traditional roles such as importer and distributor.
Other Regions
Most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they receive regulatory approval to be sold in Japan. We obtained approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, or MHLW, for our AquaBeam Robotic System in February 2022. We are in the process of pursuing national reimbursement status in Japan for Aquablation therapy. Based on the reimbursement level and the market penetration for our procedure, there can be no assurance that adoption of our procedure will occur in Japan. If our procedure is not adopted and we are not successful in obtaining adequate procedure reimbursement, then the demand for our products in Japan could be limited. The process of reimbursement for surgical procedures in Japan is supported by the surgical societies. 
Regulations in other countries, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Certain countries, such as China and South Korea, have their own regulatory agencies. These countries typically require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations. We obtained regulatory approval from the South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MFDS, in February 2022.
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse and Physician Payment Transparency Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, foreign, federal, and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including stock, stock options, and the compensation derived through ownership interests.
Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Our arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other persons or entities who are in a position to refer may not fully meet the stringent criteria specified in the various safe harbors. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances and may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply more broadly to items or services covered by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. In addition, private parties may initiate “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the federal civil False Claims Act in the name of the government and share in the proceeds of any monetary recovery. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Penalties for federal civil False Claim Act violations include penalties for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, most critically, may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare program. There are also criminal penalties for making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare 
benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased foreign, federal, and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the CMS, information related to payments or and other “transfers of value” made to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse-midwives) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners. Certain foreign countries and U.S. states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.
Many foreign countries have similar laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Foreign laws and regulations may vary greatly from country to country. For example, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EU Directives concerning misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Violations of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant penalties including administrative, civil, and criminal  damages, disgorgement, fines, additional reporting requirements and compliance oversight obligations in the event that a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement is required to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and/or individual imprisonment, 
Healthcare Reform Measures
In the United States, there have been, and may continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services.
By way of example, in the United States, the ACA was enacted in March 2010 and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts our industry. The ACA contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, all of which have impacted existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that states and individuals lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA’s individual mandate, post-repeal of its associated tax penalty. Additionally, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, and in connection with subsequent legislation, reduced Medicare payments to providers which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover Medicare overpayments to providers from three to five years. The current presidential administration and Congress may continue to pursue significant changes to the current healthcare laws.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Laws
Our U.S. operations are subject to the FCPA. We are required to comply with the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their employees, agents and intermediaries from engaging in bribery or authorizing, promising, providing, or offering, directly or indirectly, anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which requires such companies to maintain complete and accurate books and records and maintain a system of internal accounting controls. We also are subject to similar anticorruption laws and regulations implementing the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
Our growing and skilled employee base drives our success and helps us progress towards our vision of restoring patient lives by delivering the BPH treatment of choice. As of December 31, 2022, we had 428 employees.
Our future success depends on our ability to attract, retain, engage and further develop top talent. To facilitate talent attraction, retention, engagement and development, we strive for a diverse workplace with a superior employee experience that provides opportunities for our employees to grow within the organization, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and health and wellness programs and an inclusive environment. 
In 2022, we published our Environmental, Social, and Governance or ESG Report which is available on our website at and includes more detailed information on our human capital programs and initiatives. Nothing contained on or accessible through our website, including our ESG Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, are pillars around which we build our organization because we strongly believe that it drives superior results – and truly reflects the communities we serve and in which we work. We believe that everyone should feel included and fairly treated, and we embrace the unique qualities of our employees including all genders and gender identities, races, ethnicities, ages, national origins, disabilities, sexual orientations, military and socioeconomic backgrounds, and religions, as well as any other protected characteristics. 
Additionally, from a governance perspective, we maintain a mix of skills, backgrounds and experience in our executive team and in our board to serve the needs of our diverse stakeholders. 
Health, Safety and Wellness
The health, safety and wellness of our employees is an area where we continued to invest and expand throughout 2022. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of comprehensive health, wellness and time off programs that support physical, mental, emotional and financial well-being. We have a zero-tolerance policy concerning workplace violence including any threatening behavior on our premises or during any work-related activities.
We implement changes to our work environment that we determine are in the best interest of our employees and in compliance with government regulations in response to COVID-19 and other risks. We have established safety protocols 
including personal protective equipment or PPE, screening and testing, drills and regular communications for those onsite to protect our employees as needed. 
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our Company’s performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. We believe compensation and rewards should be fair and merit based and free from discrimination on the basis of race, gender or any other protected characteristics. We provide a comprehensive suite of compensation and benefits programs including annual bonuses, equity awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, retirement savings plans, healthcare, income protection benefits, paid time off, leave of absence benefits, flexible work arrangements, and numerous well-being benefits. 
Talent Development
Professional growth is a key indicator of employee satisfaction and helping our employees reach and exceed their goals helps us retain and engage our outstanding talent. We foster professional growth by providing stretch assignments, projects and manager-led coaching and mentoring to help employees meet their career goals. We continuously work on improving manager effectiveness by providing just-in-time training on people processes and build our leadership bench via a coaching program that focuses on feedback and leadership development. 
We have an annual global performance review process for reviewing all employees’ performance as well as an annual compensation process to review pay. To support our managers, we train them on conducting effective performance reviews and making compensation recommendations, considering market pay data, experience in role and performance.
Engagement and Community
We strive to continuously improve our employee experience to impact employee retention and engagement, and we periodically conduct an engagement survey and take actions to address areas of employee concern. 
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, would have a material adverse effect on our business.
