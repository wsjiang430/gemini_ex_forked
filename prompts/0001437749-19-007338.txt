ITEM 1. Business
Corporate Overview
 
Nuo Therapeutics, Inc. is a Delaware corporation organized in 1998 under the name Informatix Holdings, Inc. As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “Nuo Therapeutics,” “Nuo” and the “Company” refer to Nuo Therapeutics, Inc., and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, unless the context indicates otherwise. In 1999, Autologous Wound Therapy, Inc., or AWT, an Arkansas Corporation, merged with and into Informatix Holdings, Inc. and the name of the surviving corporation was changed to Autologous Wound Therapy, Inc. In 2000, AWT changed its name to Cytomedix, Inc., or Cytomedix. In 2001, Cytomedix, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, after which Cytomedix was authorized to continue to conduct its business as a debtor and debtor-in-possession. Cytomedix emerged from bankruptcy in 2002 under a Plan of Reorganization. At that time, all of Cytomedix’s securities or other claims against or equity interest in Cytomedix, were canceled and of no further force or effect. Holders of certain securities, other claims or equity interests were entitled to receive new securities from Cytomedix in exchange for their securities, other claims or equity interests prior to the bankruptcy. In September 2007, Cytomedix received 510(k) clearance for the Aurix System, or Aurix (formerly known as the AutoloGel™ System), from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In April 2010, Cytomedix acquired the Angel® Whole Blood Separation System, referred to as Angel or the Angel® Business, from Sorin Group USA, Inc., or Sorin. In February 2012, Cytomedix, acquired Aldagen, Inc., or Aldagen, a privately held developmental cell-therapy company located in Durham, NC. In 2014, Cytomedix changed its name to Nuo Therapeutics, Inc. In 2016, Nuo Therapeutics filed for and emerged from bankruptcy under Chapter 11 as described below under “- Bankruptcy and Emergence from Bankruptcy.” Aldagen is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nuo Therapeutics. Our principal offices are located at 207A Perry Parkway, Suite 1, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20877; and our telephone number is (240) 499-2680.
 
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Regions
 
Through December 31, 2018, Nuo Therapeutics had only one operating segment. Nuo Therapeutics primarily operates in the United States (“U.S.”). Revenues from sales generated outside the U.S. are separately presented in this report under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
 
Our Business 
 
We are a regenerative therapies company developing and marketing products for chronic wound care primarily within the U.S. We commercialize innovative cell-based technologies that harness the regenerative capacity of the human body to trigger natural healing. The use of autologous (from self) biological therapies for tissue repair and regeneration is part of a clinical strategy designed to improve long-term recovery in inherently complex chronic conditions with significant unmet medical needs.
 
Our current commercial offering consists of a point of care technology for the safe and efficient separation of autologous (i.e., the patient’s own) blood to produce a platelet based therapy for the chronic wound care market (“Aurix” or the “Aurix System”). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, cleared the Aurix System for marketing in 2007 as a device under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Aurix is the only platelet derived product cleared by the FDA for chronic wound care use and is indicated for most exuding wounds. The advanced wound care market, within which Aurix competes, is composed of advanced wound care dressings, wound care devices, and wound care biologics, and is estimated to be an approximate $13.4 billion global market, with the number of patients suffering from all forms of chronic wounds projected to increase worldwide at a rate of approximately eight percent per year through 2025.
 
The Aurix System produces a platelet rich plasma, or PRP, gel at the point of care using the patient’s own platelets and plasma. Aurix comprises a natural, endogenous complement of protein and non-protein signal molecules that contribute to effective healing. During treatment, the patient’s platelets are activated and release hundreds of growth factor proteins and other signaling molecules that form a biologically active hematogel. Aurix delivers concentrations of the natural complement of cytokines, growth factors and chemokines that are known to regulate angiogenesis (i.e., the development of new blood vessels), cell growth and the formation of new tissue. Once applied to the prepared wound bed, the biologically active Aurix hematogel can restore the balance in the wound environment to transform a non-healing wound to a wound that heals naturally.
 
A 2012 Medicare National Coverage Determination, or NCD, from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, reversed a twenty-year old non-coverage decision for autologous blood derived products used in wound care; this NCD allows for Medicare coverage under the Coverage with Evidence Development, or CED, program.  CED programs have been employed for a variety of other therapies, including transcatheter aortic valve repair and cochlear implantation.  Under the CED program, CMS provides reimbursement for items or services on the condition that they be furnished in approved clinical protocols or in the collection of additional clinical data.  Under the CED program, a facility treating a patient with Aurix is reimbursed by Medicare when health outcomes data are collected to inform future coverage decisions. The intent of the CED program is to evaluate the outcomes of Aurix therapy for the broader Medicare population when it is used in a “real world” continuum of care.  
 
Since early 2015, we have been primarily pursuing enrollment of patients into three clinical study protocols authorized and approved by CMS under CED.  Under these three protocols, Aurix can be used for venous, pressure and diabetic foot ulcers for wound types of all severities and for patients with various and often difficult comorbidities. The Company’s collaboration with Restorix Health, Inc., or Restorix, initiated in 2016, was intended to expand patient enrollment in these three protocols. The Company and Restorix have been unsuccessful in meaningfully expanding patient enrollment in the three clinical study protocols and the collaboration is effectively on hold pending clarity on the outcome of our discussions with CMS described below under “Our Strategy”.
 
 1


Although FDA cleared the Aurix System for marketing in 2007 under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, CMS only established economically viable reimbursement for the product beginning in 2016. For 2018, the CMS national average reimbursement rate for the Aurix System is $1,568 per treatment, which we believe provides appropriate payment to facilities for product usage. The Company markets the Aurix System at a cost of $700 per treatment to wound care facilities operating in the CED program.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our immediate focus is on successfully concluding discussions with the Coverage and Analysis Group (CAG) of CMS concerning our request to reopen the NCD for diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) based on the evidence collected under CED to date for this wound etiology.  On October 22, 2018, Company’s management met with representatives of CMS’ Coverage and Analysis Group (CAG) to discuss the status of the three study protocols (for diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers and pressure ulcers) totaling 2,200 patients under the Company’s CED program. The Company presented to CAG its view that completion of the studies to full enrollment was no longer considered practical and that completion of the CED studies as presently structured was untenable. The Company discussed with CAG a variety of difficulties and limitations that have arisen during the conduct of the CED program that have contributed to slow enrollment, closure of study sites, and physician engagement.
 
At the meeting and based on a suggestion from CAG representatives in prior conversations, we presented preliminary statistical data from the three protocols with an emphasis on diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) as that protocol had the largest enrollment.  The preliminary analysis indicated that there was a statistically significant healing benefit for the treatment arm (Aurix plus Usual and Customary Care) versus Usual and Customary Care (UCC) alone.  Uniquely for these CED protocols intended to represent real world clinical practice, UCC was defined to include essentially any wound care therapy which the treating clinician and patient determined was in the best interests of promoting a healing benefit for the wound.
 
After our October 2018 meeting, we continued in periodic dialogue with CAG and responded to a request for further analysis of the study data for DFUs and to prepare a draft manuscript appropriate for submission to a peer-reviewed scientific journal that CAG could use to perform a more substantive review of the study data and outcomes.   We submitted the draft manuscript to CAG in January 2019 and a revised draft in late March 2019 based on questions and clarification requested by CAG in early March.   A substantially similar manuscript was submitted for consideration to a wound care journal and the Company was recently notified of an acceptance for publication.  The accepted journal article entitled “A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Conducted Under Medicare’s Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) Paradigm Demonstrates Aurix Gel is an Effective Intervention for Chronic Diabetic Foot Ulcers” has the following highlights:
 

● | An Intent to Treat population of 129 patients with DFUs were randomized to either Aurix (n=66) or UCC (n=63) in 28 wound care centers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Given the intent to focus on standard clinical practice, the study included more severe wounds and a range of difficult comorbidities that are normally not allowed in traditional clinical trials conducted in wound care.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 84% of wounds were classified as Wagner grade 2 or 3 (an additional 8% Wagner grade 4) representing wound severity far more pronounced than seen in standard wound care clinical studies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 48.5% (32) of Aurix treatment arm and 30.2% (19) of UCC only control arm wounds healed within the study’s 12-week treatment period (p=0.0304).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In a smaller subgroup of 80 patients where Aurix was the only advanced wound care therapy utilized; i.e., only standard of care dressings and ointments with no usage of hyperbaric oxygen, negative pressure wound therapy, and/or cellular/tissue products:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | 51% (26/51) of Aurix treatment arm wounds healed
--+-------------------------------------------------


o | 27.6% (8/29) of UCC only control arm wounds healed.
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Smoking (52%) and peripheral arterial disease (43%) were the most prevalent health risks and comorbidities present in the study population.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | There was no statistical association between these health risks/comorbidities and the treatment and control arms that would confound interpretation of the healing outcomes between the two arms.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe these data for DFUs as collected and analyzed under CED in combination with the other clinical evidence collected and published by the Company over the past several years provides sufficient evidence to warrant a re-opening of the NCD for DFUs and an ultimate determination that coverage of Aurix is appropriate and in the best interests of Medicare beneficiaries.  However, our discussions with CAG to date raise substantial doubt that CAG will approve our request to re-open the NCD, or at least do so in a timeframe necessary for us to avoid liquidation in the immediate future.  Further discussion with CMS are needed to determine how and under what conditions additional healing data and outcomes for venous leg ulcers and pressure ulcers can be collected for those wound etiologies.
 
The expansion of reimbursement to patients outside of CED can be achieved only after a successful NCD re-determination. There are no assurances that broad access and reimbursement can be achieved. Because Medicare beneficiaries represent the majority of chronic wound patients in the United States and since commercial insurance coverage determinations often follow CMS coverage and reimbursement decisions, we believe that a decision to reopen the NCD for diabetic foot ulcers would substantially increase the potential commercial value of Aurix. Thus, we continue to believe that the market for innovative technologies that harness the innate regenerative capacity of the human body to trigger natural healing represents a significant opportunity from both a clinical and a business perspective.
 
Even if CAG approves our request to re-open the NCD, and does so in a timeframe necessary for us to avoid liquidation in the immediate future, we will require significant additional capital to fully support an expanded commercialization initiative designed to increase market adoption and penetration of Aurix. See “– Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 
The Science Underlying Aurix/Platelet Rich Plasma
 
Normal Wound Healing
 
The science underlying wound healing is well-established. An immediate early event critical for wound healing is the influx of platelets to the wound site. Platelets bind to elements within damaged tissue such as collagen fragments and endogenous thrombin molecules and are activated to release a diversity of growth factors and other biomolecules from their alpha and dense granules (Reed 2000, Nieswandt, 2003). These biomolecules provide signals essential for biological responses regulating hemostasis and effective tissue regeneration.
Chronic Wounds
 
Dysregulation of numerous cellular and biological responses contribute to the chronic wound phenotype. Chronic wounds have reduced levels of growth factors and concomitant decreases in cellular proliferation (Mast 1996). There is increased cellular senescence (Telgenhoff 2005), and there generally is a lack of perfusion that can inhibit the delivery of nutrients and cells required for regeneration (Guo 2010). As the body attempts to stave off infection, elevated concentrations of free radicals accumulate in the chronic wound and further damage surrounding tissue (Moseley 2004, James 2003).

Aurix Therapy
 
Aurix has been cleared by FDA as safe and effective with an indication for chronic wounds such as leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, and diabetic ulcers and other exuding wounds such as mechanically or surgically-debrided wounds. The Aurix therapeutic is formed by mixing a sample of a patient’s platelets and plasma with pharmaceutical grade thrombin and ascorbic acid. The thrombin activates platelets while ascorbic acid drives the synthesis of high tensile strength collagen, clears damaging free radicals and controls gel consistency. The topical dermal application of Aurix gel bypasses the lack of local perfusion to provide immediate signals for new tissue formation and ultimately healing.
The Efficacy of Aurix Relates to Biological Activity Released by Platelets
 
Regenerative Capacity
 
More than 300 proteins are released by human platelets in response to thrombin activation (Coppinger, 2004). Important examples include vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B) (Eppley 2004, Everts 2006). These proteins are critical for organized wound healing, regulating responses such as vascularization, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and deposition of new extracellular matrix (Goldman 2004). Platelets also release chemokines such as Interleukin-8 (IL-8), stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and platelet factor-4 (PF-4) (Chatterjee 2011, Gear 2003) that control the mobilization and migration of stem cells and fibroblasts, (Werner 2003 and Gillitzer 2001) that contribute to tissue regeneration.
Anti-infective Activity
 
Populations of bioburden in chronic wounds vary over time and wounds invariably retain or become re-infected with some level of bacteria that is detrimental to healing (Howell-Jones 2005). In addition to regenerative capacity, platelets release anti-microbial peptides effective against a broad range of pathogens including Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) (Moojen 2007, Jia 2010, Tang 2002, Bielecki 2007).
Clinical Efficacy
 
Multiple efficacy and effectiveness studies have been published in peer reviewed journals documenting the impact of using Aurix to treat chronic wounds. Key data beyond what is discussed above concerning the recently analyzed CED data in DFUs include:

● | In a double blinded randomized controlled trial, 81% of the most common-sized diabetic foot ulcers healed with Aurix compared with 42% of control wounds. Mean time to healing was 6 weeks. (Driver V, Hanft J, Fylling, C et al.: A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial of Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma Gel for the Treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers. Ostomy Wound Management, 2006; 52(6): 68-87.) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In 285 chronic wounds in 200 patients, 96.5% of the wounds had a positive response within an average of 2.2 weeks with an average of 2.8 Aurix treatments (de Leon J, Driver VR, Fylling CP, Carter MJ, Anderson C, Wilson J, et al.: The Clinical Relevance of Treating Chronic Wounds With an Enhanced Near-physiological Concentration of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Gel. Advances in Skin and Wound Care, 2011; 24(8), 357-368.) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In a retrospective, longitudinal study of 40 Wagner grade II through IV diabetic foot ulcers, most with critical limb ischemia, wounds increased in size in the approximate 100 days prior to the initiation of comprehensive wound care treatment. Upon treatment with debridement, revascularization, antibiotics and off-loading, the wounds continued to increase in size over a subsequent 75 day period. Once they were then treated with Aurix, the wounds immediately changed healing trajectory and 83% of the wounds healed with an average of 6.1 Aurix treatments per wound (Sakata, J., Sasaki, S., Handa, K., et al. A Retrospective, Longitudinal Study to Evaluate Healing Lower Extremity Wounds in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus and Ischemia Using Standard Protocols of Care and Platelet-Rich Plasma Gel in a Japanese Wound Care Program. Ostomy Wound Management, 2012; 58(4):36-49.)

Aurix Licensing and Collaboration Arrangements
 
In September 2009, we entered into an original license and distribution agreement with Millennia Holdings, Inc., or Millennia (collectively with its affiliates), for the Company’s Aurix System in Japan.
 
As of December 31, 2014, we granted to Rohto Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Rohto, a royalty bearing, nontransferable, exclusive license, with limited right to sublicense, to use certain of the Company’s intellectual property for the development, import, use, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution for all wound care and topical dermatology applications of the Aurix System and related intellectual property and know-how in human and veterinary medicine in Japan in exchange for an upfront payment from Rohto of $3.0 million. The agreement also contemplates additional royalty payments based on the net sales of Aurix in Japan and an additional cash payment of $1.0 million if and when the reimbursement price for the national health insurance system in Japan has been achieved after marketing authorization as described below.

In conjunction with the Rohto license, we amended our licensing and distribution agreement with Millennia to terminate the agreement and to allow us to transfer the Japanese exclusivity rights from Millennia to Rohto. In connection with this amendment, we paid a one-time, non-refundable fee of $1.5 million to Millennia upon our receipt of the $3.0 million upfront payment from Rohto, are required to make a one-time, non-refundable payment of $0.5 million upon our receipt of the $1.0 million reimbursement milestone payment from Rohto, and may be required to make future royalty payments up to a maximum of $5 million to Millennia based upon net sales in Japan.  Millennia has been instrumental in establishing the advanced wound care market in Japan, and will continue to work with Rohto to develop the market for Aurix in that market. Further, Rohto has assumed responsibility for securing the marketing authorization from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, while we will provide relevant product information, as well as clinical and other data to support Rohto’s regulatory initiatives.
 
On May 28, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the license and distribution agreement, reflecting the following material revisions:
 

● | The milestone payment that Rohto was obligated to make upon achievement of the pricing event was reduced from $1,000,000 to $300,000, and the definition of the pricing event was expanded to include a second trigger. As a result of the Amendment, the pricing event occurs on the earlier of (a) achievement of the National Health Insurance system (“NHI”) reimbursement price for the licensed product in Japan and (b) achievement of NHI reimbursement for the treatment by treating clinicians of patients using the licensed product in Japan in the field of use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The royalty payment structure was amended. Previously, the royalty was 9% of net sales. This was amended to provide that the royalty would be 9% of net sales so long as Rohto uses any Nuo patent, and 5% of net sales if Rohto does not use any Nuo patent and in certain other circumstances described in the amendment. The royalty payment obligation expires at the later of December 31, 2029 or the expiration of the relevant Nuo patent. The two relevant patents have expiration dates in 2019 and 2032.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On October 24, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement for Sale of Intellectual Property (the “IP Sale Agreement”) and a License and Service Agreement (the “Service Agreement” and collectively the “Agreements”) with Rohto.
 
The IP Sale Agreement provided for the sale to Rohto of the intellectual property under license pursuant to the amended license and distribution agreement (consisting of two of our patents in Japan, our know-how in Japan and trademarks for Aurix and AutoloGel in Japan). The IP Sale Agreement provided that, upon the completion of such transfers and payments, the amended license and distribution agreement would be terminated. Under the IP Sale Agreement, we are subject to a five-year non-compete in Japan.
 
Under the Service Agreement, we agreed to the sale of a patent application in Brazil, the grant of a royalty-free license to our know how in the Field of Use in Brazil and India, and the grant of a royalty-free non-exclusive license to the use of our device patent in the Field of Use in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The latter license becomes effective if and only if we cease our business with respect to the Aurix System or grant a non-exclusive license to a third party to use the device patent in the Field of Use in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The “Field of Use” is defined as the use of the Aurix System and the modified medical device being developed by Rohto under the Japan patents sold to Rohto for all wound care and topical dermatology applications in human and animal medicine. Under the Service Agreement, we are subject to a non-compete in Brazil and India.
 
The aggregate consideration received under the Agreements was $750,000.
 
On March 22, 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Restorix, pursuant to which we agreed to provide Restorix with certain limited geographic exclusivity benefits over a defined period of time for the usage of the Aurix System in up to 30 of the approximately 125 hospital outpatient wound care clinics with which Restorix has a management contract, or the RXH Partner Hospitals, in exchange for Restorix making minimum commitments of patients enrolled in three prospective clinical research studies primarily consisting of patient data collection, or the Protocols, necessary to maintain exclusivity under the Collaboration Agreement. The initial term of the Collaboration Agreement expired in March 2018 and has not been extended by the parties.
 
Effective as of May 5, 2016, the Company and Boyalife Hong Kong Ltd., or Boyalife, an entity affiliated with the Company’s significant stockholder, Boyalife Investment Fund I, Inc., entered into an Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement with an initial term of five years, unless the agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. We refer to this agreement as the Boyalife Distribution Agreement. Under this agreement, Boyalife received a non-transferable, exclusive license, with limited right to sublicense, to use certain of the Company’s intellectual property relating to its Aurix System for the purposes and in the territory specified below. Under the agreement, Boyalife is entitled to import, use for development, promote, market, sell and distribute the Aurix Products in greater China (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau) for all regenerative medicine applications, including but not limited to wound care and topical dermatology applications in human and veterinary medicine. For purposes of this agreement, “Aurix Products” are defined as the combination of devices to produce a wound dressing from the patient’s blood - as of May 5, 2016 consisting of centrifuge, wound dressing kit and reagent kit. Under the Boyalife Distribution Agreement, Boyalife is obligated to pay the Company (a) $500,000 within 90 days of approval of the Aurix Products by the China Food and Drug Administration, but no earlier than December 31, 2018, and (b) a distribution fee per wound dressing kit and reagent kit of $40, payable quarterly, subject to an agreement by the parties to discuss in good faith the appropriate distribution fee if the pricing of such kits exceeds the current general pricing in greater China. Under the agreement, Boyalife is entitled, with the Company’s approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to procure devices from a third party in order to assemble them with devices supplied by the Company to make the Aurix Products. Boyalife also has a right of first refusal with respect to the Aurix Products in specified countries in the Asia Pacific region excluding Japan and India, exercisable in exchange for a payment of no greater than $250,000 in the aggregate. If Boyalife files a new patent application for a new invention relating to wound dressings, the Aurix Products or the Company’s technology, Boyalife will grant the Company a free, non-exclusive license to use such patent application outside greater China during the term of the Boyalife Distribution Agreement.

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, and other countries extensively regulate pharmaceutical products, biologics, and medical devices. The Company’s products and product candidates are subject to approval or clearance by the governing bodies prior to and during the marketing and distribution of a product. Regulatory requirements apply to, but are not limited to, research and development, safety and efficacy, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, advertising and marketing, and the import and export of products. Before a product candidate is approved by the governing bodies for commercial marketing, rigorous preclinical and human clinical testing may be necessary to conduct to determine the safety and efficacy or effectiveness of the product. If the Company fails to comply with the applicable laws and regulations at any time during the product development process, approval or clearance process, or during commercialization, it may become subject to administrative and/or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, refusal to approve or clear pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of the Company’s operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. Any enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Medical Device Regulation
 
The Company currently manufactures and distributes the Aurix System. As such, this and future products manufactured and/or distributed by the Company may be subject to regulations by the applicable governing bodies, including but not limited to, the FDA, Health Canada, the European Medicines Agency, the Japanese Ministry of Health & Welfare, and other regulatory agencies. The Company currently has limited business development initiatives outside of the U.S. Each of the foreign governing bodies noted above serve a similar function as the FDA. As such, the Company and its products and product candidates are subject to the regulations enforced by the outside governing bodies. These regulations include, but are not limited to, product clearance, documentation requirements, good manufacturing practices and medical device reporting. Labeling and promotional activities are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, in certain circumstances. Current enforcement policies prohibit the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. Each governing body reviews the labeling and advertising of medical devices to ensure that unapproved uses are not promoted. Before a new medical device can be introduced to the market, the manufacturer must obtain clearance or approval from the applicable regulatory agency, depending upon the device classification. In the U.S., medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, II, or III. The regulations enforced by the FDA and/or the appropriate governing bodies to the medical device(s) provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective. In the U.S., Class I devices are non-critical products that the FDA believes can be adequately regulated by “general controls” which include provisions relating to labeling, manufacturer registration, defect notification, records and reports, and current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, based on the FDA’s Quality Systems Regulations. Most Class I devices are exempt from pre-market notification and some are also exempt from cGMP requirements. Class II devices are products for which the general controls of Class I devices, by themselves, are not sufficient to assure safety and effectiveness and, therefore, require additional controls. Additional controls for Class II devices may include performance standards, post-market surveillance patient registries, and the use of FDA guidelines. Standards may include both design and performance requirements. Class III devices have the most restrictive controls and require pre-market approval by the FDA. Generally, Class III devices are limited to life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. All of the governing bodies with responsibility over the Company’s products have the ability to inspect medical device manufacturers, order recalls of medical devices in some circumstances, seize non-complying medical devices, and to pursue prosecution of either civil or criminal violations.
 
Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, requires individuals or companies manufacturing medical devices intended for human use to file a notice with the FDA at least ninety days before intending to introduce the device into the market. This notice, commonly referred to as a 510(k) premarket notification, must identify the type of classified device into which the product falls, the class of that type, and a specific product already being marketed or cleared by the FDA and to which the product is “substantially equivalent.” In some instances, the 510(k) must include data from human clinical studies to establish “substantial equivalence.” The FDA must agree with the claim of “substantial equivalence” before the device can be marketed. The statutory time frame for clearance of a 510(k) is ninety days, though it often takes longer. Nuo Therapeutics currently only markets a product that is subject to 510(k) clearance.
 
The Company currently markets the Aurix System, consisting of the Aurix Wound Dressing Kit, Aurix Reagent Kit, and Aurix System Centrifuge II. Each System’s component is a legally-marketed product that has been cleared by FDA and/or the appropriate governing body. The Aurix System Centrifuge II, when used with the Aurix Wound Dressing Kit and Aurix Reagent Kit, are suitable for use on exuding wounds such as leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and diabetic ulcers, and for the management of mechanically or surgically-debrided wounds.
 
As a specification developer, manufacturer and distributor of medical devices, Nuo Therapeutics complies with, among other standards and regulations, e.g., the FDCA and implementing regulations at 21 CFR et seq. and ISO 13485. As a manufacturer and distributor of medical devices, the Company, and in some instances its subcontractors, is required to register its facilities and products manufactured annually with the appropriate governing bodies and certain state agencies. Additionally, the Company is subject to periodic inspections by the governing bodies to assess compliance with cGMP regulations. Facilities may also be subject to inspections by other federal, foreign, state or local agencies. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
The Company may also be indirectly subject to federal and state anti-kickback and physician self-referral laws. Federal physician self-referral legislation (commonly known as the Stark Law) prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral, and any person collecting any amounts in connection with an unlawful referral is obligated to refund such amounts. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or “CMS,” has issued numerous regulations containing exceptions to the prohibitions of the Stark Law. If a physician and a DHS entity have financial relationship subject to the Stark Law, then an exception must be met or else the DHS entity cannot bill for the service. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. The penalties for violating the Stark Law also include civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per referral and possible exclusion from federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the Stark Law have also been the basis for False Claims Act actions, discussed below. Various states have corollary laws to the Stark Law (so-called “baby Stark” laws), including laws that require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a health care provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider. Both the scope and exception for such laws vary from state to state.

The Company may also be subject to federal and state anti-kickback laws. Section 1128B (b) of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Law, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Law is broad, and it prohibits many arrangements and practices that are otherwise lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. The Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, has issued regulations, commonly known as “safe harbors” that set forth certain provisions which, if fully met, will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Law. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Law, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Law will be pursued. The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Law include imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $250,000 per violation for individuals and up to $500,000 per violation for companies and possible exclusion from federal health care programs. As with the Stark Law, violations of the Anti-Kickback Law can result in a False Claims Act action. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Law, and some of these state prohibitions apply to patients for health care services reimbursed by any source, not only federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In this connection, please refer to the Risk Factor titled "The 20% Medicare Co-Payment Presents a Potential Obstacle to Adequate Levels of Patient Enrollment in the CED Protocols." 
 
In addition, there are other U.S. health care fraud laws to which the Company may be subject, one which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payers (“fraud on a health benefit plan”) and one which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. These laws apply to any health benefit plan, not just Medicare and Medicaid. 
 
The Company may also be subject to other U.S. laws which prohibit submitting, or causing to be submitted, claims for payment or causing such claims to be submitted that are false. Violation of these false claims statutes may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health programs. These statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits the knowing filing of a false claim (or causing the submission of a false claim) or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the U.S. federal government. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the failure to report and refund an overpayment to the Medicare or Medicaid programs within 60 days of the identification of the overpayment may also be an obligation subjecting the defendant to a False Claims Act action. Finally, a recent U.S. Supreme Court case, Universal Health Services v. United States ex rel. Escobar, approved the “implied false certification” theory under which a defendant submits a claim for payment that makes a specific representation about the goods or services provider, but fails to disclose the defendant’s noncompliance with a statutory, regulatory or contractual requirement that would be material to the Government’s payment decision. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim. These amounts are likely to increase dramatically in accordance with the provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, under which the U.S. Department of Justice adjusted for inflation civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced by components of the Department. This change will increase the per claim penalty range to $10,781-$21,563. Suits filed under the False Claims Act can be brought by an individual on behalf of the government (a “qui tam action”). Such individuals (known as “qui tam relators”) may share in the amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition certain states have enacted laws modeled after the False Claims Act. “Qui tam” actions have increased significantly in recent years causing greater numbers of health care companies to have to defend false claim actions, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state health care programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.
 
Several states also have referral, fee splitting and other similar laws that may restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration in connection with the purchase or rental of medical equipment and supplies. State laws vary in scope and have been infrequently interpreted by courts and regulatory agencies, but may apply to all health care products and services, regardless of whether Medicaid or Medicare funds are involved.

Competition
 
While Aurix has no direct competition in the chronic wound care market from any other FDA cleared platelet derived products, we face competition from pharmaceutical companies, biopharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, and other competitors in the areas of advanced wound care dressings, wound care devices, and wound care biologics. Leading companies in the advanced wound care market include Smith and Nephew, Acelity (KCI, Systegenix, and LifeCell), MoInlycke, and ConvaTec.  Leading competitors in the wound care market that offer other biologic products such as tissue-based products include companies such as MiMedx, Osiris, Organogenesis, Integra Life Sciences, as well as a significant number of smaller companies.  While we believe that Aurix can compete favorably on the basis of broad application across multiple wound etiologies, we expect that many physicians and allied professionals will continue to employ other treatment approaches and technologies, separately and in combination, in an attempt to treat chronic and hard-to heal wounds.  The chronic wound market has many therapies that compete with Aurix that have established habitual use patterns and provider contracts to encourage standardized use.  Furthermore, other companies have developed or are developing products that could be in direct future competition with our current product line.   We may not be able to compete effectively against such companies. Many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources, larger marketing staffs and more experience in commercializing products than we do. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Relating to the Company’s Financial Position, Business and Industry - Our Products Have Existing Competition in the Marketplace.”
 
Raw Materials
 
A reagent used for our Aurix product, bovine thrombin (Thrombin JMI), is available exclusively through Pfizer. Pfizer may unilaterally raise the price for the reagent. If a temporary or permanent interruption in the supply of the reagent were to occur, or the manufacturing costs charged by Pfizer exceed what we can reasonably afford, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.
