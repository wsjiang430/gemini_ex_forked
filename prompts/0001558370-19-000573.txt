 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 General
 We are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products. Our Company, a Delaware corporation, was formed in 2004 to hold the Huntsman businesses, which were founded by Jon M. Huntsman. Mr. Huntsman founded the predecessor to our Company in 1970 as a small polystyrene plastics packaging company. Since then, we have grown through a series of significant acquisitions and now own a global portfolio of businesses. 
 We operate all of our businesses through Huntsman International, our 100% owned subsidiary. Huntsman International is a Delaware limited liability company and was formed in 1999.
 Our principal executive offices are located at 10003 Woodloch Forest Drive, The Woodlands, Texas 77380, and our telephone number at that location is (281) 719‑6000.
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

Separation and Deconsolidation of Venator
 In August 2017, we separated our Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives business (“the P&A Business”) and conducted an initial public offering (“IPO”) of ordinary shares of Venator Materials PLC (“Venator”), formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Huntsman (“the Separation”). Additionally, in December 2017, we conducted a secondary offering of Venator ordinary shares. All of such ordinary shares were sold by Huntsman, and Venator did not receive any proceeds from the offerings. Venator’s ordinary shares began trading on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “VNTR” on August 3, 2017. On January 3, 2018, the underwriters purchased an additional 1,948,955 Venator ordinary shares pursuant to their over-allotment option, which reduced Huntsman’s ownership interest in Venator to approximately 53%. Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, we reported the results of operations of Venator as discontinued operations. 
 During the third quarter of 2018, we recognized a net after tax valuation allowance of $270 million to adjust the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities held for sale and the amount of accumulated comprehensive income recorded in equity related to Venator to the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less cost to sell.
 On December 3, 2018, we sold an aggregate of 4,334,389, or 4%, of Venator ordinary shares to Bank of America N.A. at a price to be determined based on the average of the daily volume weighted average price of Venator ordinary shares over an agreed period. Over this agreed period, we received aggregate proceeds of $19 million, $16 million of which was received in the first quarter of 2019. This transaction allowed us to deconsolidate Venator beginning in December 2018. Following this transaction, we retained approximately 49% ownership in Venator. In connection with the deconsolidation of Venator, we recorded a pretax loss of $427 million in discontinued operations to record our remaining ownership interest in Venator at fair value. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity method investment in Venator post deconsolidation. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018, we recorded a pretax loss of $57 million to record our equity method investment in Venator at fair value. This loss was recorded in “Fair value adjustments to Venator investment” on our consolidated statements of operations. For more information, see “Note 4. Discontinued Operations and Business Dispositions—Separation and Deconsolidation of Venator” to our consolidated financial statements.
     Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility
 On May 21, 2018, Huntsman International entered into a new $1.2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2018 Revolving Credit Facility”). Borrowings under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at the rates specified in the credit agreement governing the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, which will vary based on the type of loan and Huntsman International’s debt ratings. Unless earlier terminated, the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility will mature in May 2023. Huntsman International may increase the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility commitments up to an additional $500 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. See “Note 14. Debt—Direct and Subsidiary Debt—Credit Facility” to our consolidated financial statements.
 In connection with entering into the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, Huntsman International terminated all commitments and repaid all obligations under its previous $650 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Prior Credit Facility”). In addition, we recognized a loss of early extinguishment of debt of $3 million. Upon the

termination of the Prior Credit Facility, all guarantees of the obligations under the Prior Credit Facility were terminated, and all liens granted under the Prior Credit Facility were released. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On February 7, 2018 and on May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $950 million in shares of our common stock in addition to the $50 million remaining under our September 2015 share repurchase authorization. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 10,405,457 shares of our common stock for approximately $276 million, excluding commissions, under the repurchase program. From January 1, 2019 through January 31, 2019, we repurchased an additional 537,018 shares of our common stock for approximately $11 million, excluding commissions.     Demilec Acquisition
     On April 23, 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Demilec (USA) Inc. and Demilec Inc. (collectively, “Demilec”) for approximately $353 million, including working capital adjustments, in an all-cash transaction (“Demilec Acquisition”), which was funded from our Prior Credit Facility and our U.S. accounts receivable securitization program (“U.S. A/R Program”). Demilec is a leading North American manufacturer and distributor of spray polyurethane foam formulations for residential and commercial applications. The acquired business is being integrated into our Polyurethanes segment. See “Note 3. Business Combination” to our consolidated financial statements. Overview
 We are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products. We operate in four segments: Polyurethanes, Performance Products, Advanced Materials and Textile Effects. Our products comprise a broad range of chemicals and formulations, which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers. Our products are used in a wide range of applications, including those in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and non-durable consumer products, digital inks, electronics, medical, packaging, coatings and construction, power generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dyes industries. We are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including MDI, amines, surfactants, maleic anhydride, epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals and dyes.
 In August 2017, we separated our P&A Business through an IPO of ordinary shares of Venator, formerly our wholly-owned subsidiary. Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, we reported the results of operations of Venator as discontinued operations. On December 3, 2018, we sold an additional 4% of Venator ordinary shares which allowed us to immediately deconsolidate Venator and account for our remaining ownership interest in Venator as an equity method investment using the fair value option. See “Note 4. Discontinued Operations and Business Dispositions—Separation and Deconsolidation of Venator” to our consolidated financial statements. In a series of transactions beginning in 2006, we sold or shut down substantially all of our Australian styrenics operations and our North American polymers and base chemicals operations. We also report the results of these businesses as discontinued operations.
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 10,000 associates worldwide. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $9,379 million, $8,358 million and $7,518 million, respectively.

 Our Products
 Our Polyurethanes, Performance Products, Advanced Materials and Textile Effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products. Growth in our differentiated products has been driven by the substitution of our products for other materials and by the level of global economic activity. Accordingly, the profitability of our differentiated products has been somewhat less influenced by the cyclicality that typically impacts the petrochemical industry.

 Polyurethanes
 General
 We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of polyurethane chemicals, including MDI products, PO, polyols, PG and TPU (each discussed in more detail below under “—Products and Markets”). Polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams, as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. We focus on the higher‑margin, higher‑growth markets for specialty MDI and MDI‑based polyurethane systems. Volume growth in our Polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued substitution of MDI‑based products for other materials across a broad range of applications. We operate six primary polyurethane manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe and China. We operate six primary polyurethane manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe and China. We also operate 29 strategically located downstream facilities, 25 of them are polyurethane formulation facilities, commonly referred to in the chemical industry as “systems houses,” located in close proximity to our customers worldwide (see facilities listed in “—Item 2. Properties” below), which enables us to focus on customer support, technical service and a differentiated product offering. We also operate a specialty polyol manufacturing facility focused on the insulation market and three downstream TPU manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe and China.
 Our customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate, such as MDI, with polyols, which are derived largely from PO and EO. We are able to produce over 2,500 distinct MDI‑based polyurethane products by modifying the MDI molecule through varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our MDI formulations. As a result, polyurethane products, especially those derived from MDI, are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end‑use markets, including insulation in construction and appliances, cushioning for automotive and furniture, coatings, adhesives, wood binders for construction and furniture, footwear and other specialized engineering applications.
 We are one of three North American producers of PO. We and some of our customers process PO into derivative products, such as polyols for polyurethane products, PG and various other chemical products. End uses for these derivative products include applications in the home furnishings, construction, appliances, packaging, automotive and transportation, food, paints and coatings and cleaning products industries. We also produce MTBE as a co‑product of our PO manufacturing process. MTBE is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline. See “—Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
 In 1992, we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in China. We have since expanded this facility to include an integrated polyurethanes formulation facility and a world scale research and development campus. In January 2003, we entered into two related joint ventures to build MDI production and finishing facilities near Shanghai, China in Caojing. In June 2006, HPS, a consolidated joint venture, began production at our MDI finishing plant. In September 2006, SLIC, an unconsolidated joint venture, began production at the MNB, aniline and crude MDI plants. We completed capacity expansions of these facilities during the first quarter of 2018. These world‑scale facilities strengthen our ability to service our customers in the critical Chinese market, the largest MDI market in the world, and will support the long‑term demand growth that we believe this region will continue to experience. Additionally, in November 2012, we entered into an agreement with Sinopec to form a joint venture to build a world scale PO/MTBE plant in Nanjing, China utilizing our proprietary PO/MTBE manufacturing technology. The facility was completed in early 2017 and beneficial commercial operations began in the second half of 2017. We own a 49% interest in the joint venture and account for our interest in the joint venture as an equity method investment.

 Products and Markets
 MDI is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized, higher‑value flexible foam as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. Polyols, including polyether and polyester polyols, are used in conjunction with MDI in rigid foam, flexible foam and other non‑foam applications. PO is one of the principal raw materials for producing polyether polyols. The following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals. We produce MDI, PO, Polyols and TPU products and do not produce TDI products.

 Polyurethane chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products. Depending on their needs, customers will use either component polyurethane chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements. By varying the blend, additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals, manufacturers are able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products.
 Our strategy is focused on growing our differentiated product offering (specialty MDI and polyols, formulated MDI systems and TPU), which requires a greater emphasis on formulating capability to provide our downstream customers with the end effect required in their applications These differentiated products tend to require technical solutions, offer higher margins, lower volatility and are less dependent on industry utilization rates compared to sales of component MDI or component polyols.
 MDI. MDI has grown substantially over the past three decades, increasing by a factor of 6% to 7% CAGR, well in excess of global GDP. MDI has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than other polyurethane isocyanates. This is primarily because MDI can be used to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications. We believe that MDI and formulated MDI systems, which combine MDI and polyols, will continue to grow at approximately double the rate of global GDP driven by the mega trends of energy management, food preservation, demographics and urbanization/transportation. MDI offers key products benefits of energy efficiency, comfort and durability aligned with these megatrends. We believe that MDI and formulated MDI systems will continue to substitute for alternative materials such as fiberglass in insulation, phenol formaldehyde in wood binders and TDI in automotive and furniture. Specialty cushioning and insulation applications, thermoplastic polyurethanes and adhesives and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of MDI. MDI experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting its exposure to seasonal construction‑related end markets such as insulation and composite wood products. Sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year. MTBE also experiences some seasonality in its sales revenue in the northern hemisphere (primarily North America and Europe) during the summer driving season.  Demand for MTBE, an additive to gasoline, increases during that time, resulting in increased selling prices for MTBE during the second and third quarters.

 TPU. TPU is a high‑quality, fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of MDI or an aliphatic isocyanate with polyols to produce unique qualities such as durability, flexibility, strength, abrasion‑resistance, shock absorbency and chemical resistance. We can tailor the performance characteristics of TPU to meet the specific requirements of our customers. TPU is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear industries. It is also extruded into films for apparel, wires and cables for industrial use and in a wide variety of applications in the coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers markets.
 Polyols. Polyols are combined with MDI and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of formulated polyurethane systems. Demand for specialty polyols has been growing at approximately the same rate at which MDI consumption has grown.
 Aniline. Aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture MDI. The majority of our aniline is consumed internally with some sold to third parties. We believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive, MDI manufacturers must either be integrated with an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long‑term, cost‑competitive aniline supply contract.
 PO. PO is an intermediate chemical used mainly to produce a wide range of polyols and PG. Demand for PO depends largely on overall economic demand, especially that of consumer durables. Strategically, we use PO produced at our world scale PO/MTBE facility in Port Neches, Texas, downstream in our formulated MDI systems. We also constructed a PO/MTBE facility in Nanjing, China with the strategic aim of supplying PO downstream into our China business, accelerating our differentiated growth in the world’s largest PU market. In addition, we also have an important internal strategic outlet for PO, downstream into our Performance Products amines business, which generates significant added value to the PO molecule.
 MTBE. MTBE is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline. While MTBE has been effectively eliminated in the U.S., demand continues to grow in other regions of the world. See “—Item 1A. Risk Factors.” In 2011, we announced the signing of a license agreement with Chinese chemicals manufacturer Yantai Wanhua Polyurethanes Co., Ltd, for the production of PO and MTBE. In November 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with Sinopec to construct and operate a PO/MTBE facility in China. Under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and Sinopec holds a 51% interest. See “—Manufacturing and Operations” below and “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

 It is important to recognize the strategic link between PO, polyols and MDI. MTBE is a co‑product of the PO manufacturing process and is used in the gasoline market. Our strategic focus is on growing our differentiated (specialty MDI and polyols, formulated MDI based systems and TPU) sales and the diagram below provides an overview of that focus with an approximation of the number of grades, formulations, products and stock keeping units which we produce and sell.

 Sales and Marketing
 We market our polyurethane chemicals to over 6,000 customers in more than 90 countries. Our sales, marketing and technical resources are organized to support major regional markets and key end‑use markets, some of which requires a coordinated global approach, such as key accounts across the automotive sector. These key end‑use markets include the commercial and residential insulation, appliance, automotive, footwear, furniture and coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers industries. We sell both directly and indirectly to customers, the latter via a network of distributors and agents who in turn sell our products to customers who cannot be served as cost effectively by our internal sales groups.
 We provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components (i.e., the isocyanate or the polyol) or in the form of “systems” in which we provide the total isocyanate and polyol formulation to our customers. Our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support tailored to meet our customers’ needs is critical to our long‑term success. We have strategically located our downstream polyurethane systems houses close to our customers, enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service. We believe this customer support and technical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers.
 Our strategy is to grow the number of and capability of our downstream facilities both organically and inorganically. As a result, we have made a number of “bolt‑on” acquisitions in recent years to expand our downstream footprint and align with our strategic intent.
 We believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts, in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships, have facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long‑term customer supply positions. Our sales strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by providing innovative solutions, quality products, reliable supply, competitive prices and superior customer service.
 Manufacturing and Operations
 Our world‑scale MDI production facilities are located in Geismar, Louisiana; Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and through our joint ventures in Caojing, China. These facilities receive aniline, which is a primary material used in the production of MDI, from our facilities located in Geismar, Louisiana; Wilton, U.K.; and Caojing, China. We believe that this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities is necessary to provide cost competitiveness in MDI

      At our Geismar, Rotterdam and Caojing facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce MDI. This technology contributes to our position as a low-cost MDI producer. In addition to MDI, we use a proprietary manufacturing process to manufacture PO. We own or license all technology and know‑how developed and utilized at our PO facility. Our process combines isobutane and oxygen in proprietary oxidation (peroxidation) reactors, thereby forming TBHP and TBA, which are further processed into PO and MTBE, respectively. Because our PO production process is less expensive relative to other technologies and allows PO co‑products to be processed into saleable or useable materials, we believe that our PO production technology possesses several distinct advantages over its alternatives.
 Joint Ventures
 Rubicon Joint Venture. Lanxess AG (“Lanxess”) is our joint venture partner in Rubicon LLC, which owns aniline, nitrobenzene and DPA manufacturing facilities in Geismar, Louisiana. We are entitled to approximately 85% of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of Rubicon LLC, and Lanxess is entitled to 100% of the DPA production. In addition to operating the joint venture’s aniline, nitrobenzene and DPA facilities, Rubicon LLC operates our wholly‑owned MDI, polyol and maleic anhydride facilities at Geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire Geismar complex. As a result of this joint venture, we are able to achieve greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain. Rubicon LLC is consolidated in our financial statements.
 Chinese MDI Joint Ventures. We are involved in two related joint ventures which operate MDI production facilities in Caojing, China. SLIC, our manufacturing joint venture with BASF and three Chinese chemical companies, produces MNB, aniline and crude MDI. We effectively own 35% of SLIC and account for our investment under the equity method. HPS, our splitting joint venture with Shanghai Chlor‑Alkali Chemical Company, Ltd, manufactures pure MDI, polymeric MDI, MDI variants and formulated MDI systems. We own 70% of HPS and it is consolidated in our financial statements. These projects have been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners and borrowed funds. We completed capacity expansions of these facilities in the first quarter of 2018. The total production capacity of the SLIC facilities is 1,280 million pounds per year of MDI, of which HPS is entitled to 825 million pounds.

 Chinese PO/MTBE Joint Venture. In November 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with Sinopec. The joint venture involves the construction and operation of a PO/MTBE facility in China. Under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and Sinopec holds a 51% interest. At the end of 2018, cumulative capital contributions were approximately $76 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. We received additional license fees of $7 million during 2018. Beneficial commercial operations began during the second half of 2017.

 The primary raw materials for MDI‑based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and PO. Benzene is a widely available commodity that is the primary feedstock for the production of MDI and aniline. Historically, benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs. We purchase benzene from third parties to manufacture nitrobenzene and aniline, almost all of which we then use to produce MDI.
 A major cost in the production of polyols is attributable to the costs of PO. The integration of our PO business with our polyurethane chemicals business gives us access to a competitively priced, strategic source of PO and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of MDI products. The primary raw materials used in our PO production process are butane/isobutane, propylene, methanol and oxygen.
 Competition
 Our major competitors in the polyurethane chemicals market include BASF, Covestro, DowDuPont, Wanhua Chemical Group and LyondellBasell. While these competitors and others produce various types and quantities of polyurethane chemicals, we focus on MDI and MDI‑based formulated polyurethane systems. Our downstream business is fragmented with different competitors in various markets and regions. Our competitors in downstream markets include Kingspan, Carlisle and Coim. Our polyurethane chemicals business competes in two basic ways: (1) where price is the dominant element of competition, our polyurethane chemicals business differentiates itself by its high level of customer support, including cooperation on technical and safety matters; and (2) elsewhere, we compete on the basis of product performance, our ability to react quickly to changing customer needs and providing customers with innovative solutions to their needs.  Performance Products
 General
 Our Performance Products segment has leading global positions in the manufacture and sale of amines, surfactants and maleic anhydride and serves a wide variety of consumer and industrial end markets. Our Performance Products segment is organized by region and product family. Our product families are: amines, maleic anhydride (including catalyst and licensing), surfactants (including LAB) and upstream intermediates.
 We produce a wide range of amines, many of which are sold into specialty markets such as epoxy curing agents, oil exploration and production, agrochemicals, and fuel and lubricant additives. We believe we are the largest global producer of polyetheramines, one of the largest producers of 2‑(2‑amino ethoxy) ethanol, sold under our DGA™ brand, the largest global producer making the full range of ethyleneamines, the second largest producer of morpholine and the second largest North American producer of ethanolamines. We are the only producer and largest supplier of propylene carbonate and ethylene carbonate in North America. Many of the markets for these products have growth rates in excess of global GDP.
 We believe we are the largest global producer of maleic anhydride, a highly versatile chemical intermediate that is used to produce UPRs, which are mainly used in the production of fiberglass reinforced resins for marine, automotive and construction products. Maleic anhydride is also used in the production of lubricants, food additives and artificial sweeteners. We are also the leading licensor of maleic anhydride manufacturing technology and are amongst the largest suppliers of fixed bed catalyst used in the manufacture of maleic anhydride from n-butane.
 We consume internally produced and third‑party‑sourced base petrochemicals in the manufacture of our surfactants, LAB and ethanolamines products. We produce a broad range of surfactants, which are primarily used in detergency, personal care, agrochemical, oilfield and industrial applications. We manufacture LAB for use as an intermediate in laundry detergents and a higher molecular weight alkylate used as a lubricant additive.
 We also use internally produced and third‑party‑sourced ethylene to produce EG, which is primarily used in the production of polyester fibers, PET packaging and antifreeze.

 Beginning in 2013, our Performance Products segment initiated a restructuring program to refocus its surfactants business in Europe. In connection with this program, in 2014 we completed the sale of our European commodity surfactants business, including the ethoxylation facility in Lavera, France to Wilmar. Additionally, in 2014 we ceased production at our Patrica, Italy surfactants facility. In December 2015, we announced plans for a reorganization of our commercial and technical functions and a refocused divisional business strategy to better position our segment for growth in coming years and we launched a program to capture growth opportunities, improve manufacturing cost efficiency and reduce inventories. In 2016, we expanded our EO capacity by 265 million pounds at our Port Neches, Texas facility. In December 2016, we completed the sale of our European differentiated surfactants business to Innospec Inc. for $199 million in cash plus our retention of trade receivables and payables for an enterprise value of $225 million. We remain committed to our global surfactants business, including in the U.S. and Australia, where our differentiated surfactants businesses are backward integrated into essential feedstocks.
 We operate 14 Performance Products manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia.
 The following chart illustrates the primary raw materials used and range of product types produced by the Performance Products segment:

 Products and Markets
 Amines. Amines are a family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia with various ethylene and propylene derivatives. Generally, amines are valued for their properties as a reactive agent, emulsifier, dispersant, solvent or corrosion inhibitor. Growth in demand for amines is highly correlated with GDP growth. However, certain segments of the amines market, such as polyetheramines, have historically grown at rates in excess of GDP growth due to new product development, technical innovation and end‑use substitution. As amines are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer‑specific end‑use applications, pricing does not 

 
  12

 
generally fluctuate directly with movements in underlying raw materials. Our amines business is organized around the following product groups:

Product Group | Applications 
---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polyetheramines | Epoxy composites, polyurethane foams and insulation, construction and flooring, paints and coatings, lubricant and fuel additives, adhesives, agrochemicals, oilfield chemicals, printing inks, pigment dispersion
Ethyleneamines | Chemical building block used in lubricant and fuel additives, epoxy hardeners, wet strength resins, chelating agents, fungicides 
Ethanolamines | Wood preservatives, herbicides, construction products, gas treatment, metalworking, personal care 
Other specialty amines, including DGA™ Agent | Gas treating, agricultural chemicals, personal care, lubricant and fuel additives, polyurethane foams, fabric softeners, paints and coatings, refinery processing, water treating 

      Polyetheramines are produced by reacting polyol with ammonia. They provide sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations, enabling customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing materials.
 Our ethyleneamines are manufactured by reacting EDC and caustic soda with ammonia to produce a range of various ethyleneamines homologues having different molecular weights. Most other producers utilize a reductive amination process, which yields a light slate of ethyleneamines. We believe our heavier slate of homologues allows access to a greater range of markets.
 Ethanolamines are produced by the reaction of EO with ammonia. There are three primary homologues (MEA, DEA, and TEA) with a wide range of market applications as noted above. Competition is limited due to the technical and cost barriers to entry.
 Our amines are used in a wide variety of mainly industrial applications, including composites, paints and coatings, polyurethane foam, fuel and lubricant additives, and solvents. Our key amines customers include Afton, Chevron-Oronite, Ecolab, Evonik, Hexion, Infineum, Ingevity, Lubrizol, Bayer, Procter & Gamble and PPG.
 Maleic Anhydride (including catalyst and licensing). Maleic anhydride is a highly versatile chemical intermediate that is used to produce UPRs, which are the main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced resins used for marine and automotive applications and commercial and residential construction products. Maleic anhydride is also used in the production of lubricants, food additives and artificial sweeteners.

Product Group | Applications 
---------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maleic anhydride | Boat hulls, automotive, construction, lubricant and fuel additives, countertops, agrochemicals, paper and food additives
Maleic anhydride catalyst and technology licensing | Maleic anhydride, 1-4 butanediol (BDO) and its derivatives, including polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) production 

      Maleic anhydride is produced by oxidizing either benzene or normal butane through the use of a catalyst. Our maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed butane-based process with a solvent recovery and refining system. We believe that our process is superior in the areas of feedstock and energy efficiency and solvent recovery. The maleic anhydride‑based route to BDO manufacture is currently the preferred process technology and is favored over the other routes, which utilize PO, butadiene or acetylene as feedstocks. As a result, the growth in demand for BDO supports growing demand for our maleic anhydride technology and catalyst. Generally, changes in price have resulted from a combination of changes in industry capacity utilization and underlying raw material costs.
 We license our maleic anhydride technology and supply our catalysts to licensees and to worldwide merchant customers. Revenue from licensing and catalyst comes from new plant commissioning, as well as current plant retrofits and routine catalyst changes. Our licensing group also licenses technology on behalf of other Performance Products businesses and other segments.
 Our key maleic anhydride customers include AOC, Ashland, Chevron Oronite, Cranston, Dixie, Ingevity, Lubrizol, MFG Chemical, Polynt-Reichhold and Tate & Lyle.

 Surfactants (including LAB). Surfactants or “surface active agents” are substances that combine a water soluble component with a water insoluble component in the same molecule. While surfactants are most commonly used for their detergency in cleaning applications, they are also valued for their emulsification, foaming, dispersing, penetrating and wetting properties in a variety of industries.
 We are a leading global manufacturer of nonionic surfactants products and are characterized by our breadth of product offering and market coverage. Following the sale of our European surfactants business to Innospec at the end of 2016, we now have certain products toll manufactured in Europe.

Product Group | Applications 
--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surfactants | Home and personal care, agricultural chemicals, construction, paper de‑inking and lubricants
Specialty alkylates | Precursors for lubricant additives 
LAB | Consumer, industrial and institutional detergents 

      Demand growth for surfactants used in basic detergency applications is relatively stable and exhibits little cyclicality. However, many product applications for surfactants can demand new formulations with improved performance characteristics, which affords considerable opportunity for innovative surfactants manufacturers like us to provide surfactants and blends with differentiated specifications and properties. We continue to strengthen and diversify our surfactant product offering into formulated specialty surfactant products for use in various industrial applications such as leather and textile treatment, foundry and construction, agrochemicals, fuels and lubricants, personal care and polymers and coatings.
 For basic surfactants, pricing tends to have a strong relationship to underlying raw material prices and usually lags raw material price movements. Surfactants used in more specialty applications are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer‑specific end‑use application. Our key surfactants customers include Bayer, Procter & Gamble, Henkel, Unilever, Innospec, Stephan, NuFarm, Lubrizol, Ingevity and Ecolab.
 LAB is a surfactant intermediate, which is produced through the reaction of benzene with either normal paraffins or linear alpha olefins. Nearly all the LAB produced globally is converted into LAS, a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer, industrial and institutional laundry detergents. We also manufacture a higher‑molecular‑weight alkylate, which is used as an additive to lubricants. Our key customers for LAB and specialty alkylates include Procter & Gamble, Colgate, Lubrizol, Unilever, Henkel and Church & Dwight.
 Upstream Intermediates. We consume internally produced and third‑party‑sourced base petrochemicals in the manufacture of our surfactants, LAB, and ethanolamines products, which are primarily used in detergency, consumer products and industrial applications. We also produce EG, which is primarily used in the production of polyester fibers and PET packaging.
 We consume internally produced EO to produce three homologues of EG: MEG, DEG and TEG. MEG is consumed primarily in the polyester (fiber and bottle resin) and antifreeze markets and is also used in a wide variety of industrial applications including synthetic lubricants, plasticizers, solvents and emulsifiers. DEG is consumed internally to produce Morpholine and DGA™ Agent and polyols. TEG is used internally to produce polyols and is sold into the market for dehydration of natural gas. We continue to optimize our EO and EG operations depending on the fundamental market demand for EG.

Product Group | Applications 
--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EG | Polyester fibers and PET bottle resins, heat transfer and hydraulic fluids, chemical intermediates, natural gas and hydrocarbon treating agents, unsaturated polyester resins, polyester polyols, plasticizers, solvent

      Sales and Marketing

Our innovative and sustainable digital inks technology is designed to help mills improve process efficiency, print reliability and improve overall environmental performance.
 We own a portfolio of digital inks brands such as LANASET® and TERASIL®, used for inks primarily for apparel and sportswear, and LYOSPERSE®, TERASIL® and NOVACRON®, used for inks for apparel and home textiles. We have digital ink solutions designed for the fast‑growing segments of soft‑signage and technical textiles.
 Markets. Textiles generally involve a complex matrix of fibers, colors, effects and functionality, and the resulting products range from fashion apparel to bulletproof vests, home and institutional textiles to carpet, and upholstery to automotive interiors. Our broad range of dyes, chemicals and digital inks enhance both the aesthetic appearance of these products and the functionality needed to ensure that they perform in their end‑use markets. To meet the emerging digital market landscape and increasing demands for sustainable textiles, our Textile Effects segment has a comprehensive range of digital inks to meet this trend and new market opportunity. Since the requirements for these markets vary dramatically, our business strategy focuses on three major end markets—apparel, home and institutional furnishings, and functional and technical textiles. We work to provide the right balance of products and service to meet the technical and environmental challenges in each of these markets.
 The apparel market focuses on products that provide an aesthetic effect through colors, as well as comfort and performance effects. Our solutions also extend to improving the processing efficiency within the textile mill. We offer a complete range of colors for cotton, polyester, wool and nylon that cover the range of shades needed for casualwear, sportswear, intimate apparel, and formal wear. Our dyes have been developed to ensure that they offer the highest levels of color durability currently available in the market. The Textile Effects segment’s AVITERA® dyes meet global industry environmental standards and helps textile mills increase yield, improve productivity and reduce processing costs by reducing water and energy consumption. Pretreatment and dyeing auxiliaries ensure that these fabrics are processed efficiently and effectively—cleaning the fabrics with fewer chemicals, less energy and less water and thereby minimizing the environmental footprint and reducing the processing costs. Silicone softeners may be used to enhance the feel of products. Textile Effects has developed advanced non‑fluorinated durable water repellent technology that enhances the performance levels of sportswear and outdoor wear offering comfort and durability.
 Home and institutional textiles include bed linen, towels, curtains carpets, upholstery, mattress ticking and other textiles that are used within the home or institutions such as hotels. Dyes, chemicals and digital ink technology for these applications enhance color and shape durability, comfort, prevent color fading and enable limitless design possibilities for consumers. Optical brighteners and other pretreatment products provide “bright white” effects for towels and sheeting.
 Functional and technical textiles include automotive textiles, carpet, military fabrics protective wear, nonwoven and other technical fabrics. Though the product groups may differ in their end uses, the articles must provide a high‑level of functionality, durability and performance in their respective markets. High‑lightfast dyes and UV absorbers are used 

 
  20

 
in automotive interiors and outdoor furnishings to provide colors that do not fade when exposed to sunlight and heat. Powerful stain repellent and release technology imparts durable protection for upholstery, military and medical fabrics, without affecting the color, breathability or feel of the fabric. Specialized dyes and prints create unique camouflage patterns for military uniforms, backpacks and tarps that will not fade through wash and wear or during exposure to the elements.
 Textile Effects is at the forefront of the emerging trend in digital textile printing including the time‑to‑market pressures of rapidly changing fashion trends and environmental concerns. The segment’s range of digital ink solutions cover cotton, polyester, silk and other types of fiber blends. The innovative and sustainable digital ink technology is designed to help mills improve process efficiency, print reliability and improve overall environmental performance.
 Sales and Marketing
 During 2018, approximately 62% of our sales were generated with approximately 1,600 direct customers through our global sales and technical services network and the remaining 38% is generated through our distribution partners. Our sales and technical services representatives work directly with our existing customers forming strong relationships and uncovering new opportunities. Demand for our products is subject to fabric trends and seasonal changes in connection with summer and winter fashion trends. As such, sales generally peak in the second quarter of the year as textile mills prepare for the winter fashion trends which tend to use darker shades and heavier fabric, thereby using more of our products.
 In determining the markets on which we focus, we look at growth opportunity and value proposition. Consumption markets are primarily in developed economies, such as Europe and North America, while production markets are primarily in Asia, particularly China, India, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh. Our downstream marketing team engages with leading brands and retailers in developed economies while our sales force and manufacturing footprint are primarily in Asia, closer to the manufacturing and sourcing base for textiles. We believe that this set‑up also enables us to take advantage of continuous demand growth due to demographic and lifestyle changes in emerging markets.
 For our textile effects products, we focus on providing effect competence and process competence to our customers. Effect competence, which we define as delivering value‑added effects to our customers’ products, enables us to capitalize on new and innovative technologies and to assist our customers in their efforts to differentiate themselves from competitors. Process competence, which we define as applying know‑how and expertise to improve customers’ processes, allows us to utilize our technical service to reduce cost, enhance efficiency and offer recommendations to improve the ecological and environmental footprint in the wet processing of textiles.
 We maintain strong customer relationships through the delivery of high levels of technical service and product innovation. There are 13 technical services laboratories in North America, South America, Europe and Asia that are close to our customers in these markets, which enables us to serve our customers with greater speed and flexibility.
 Manufacturing and Operations
 We are a global business serving customers in three principal geographic regions: EAME, the Americas and Asia. To service our customers efficiently, we maintain manufacturing plants around the world with a strategy of global,

(1) 95%‑owned and consolidated manufacturing joint venture with Guangzhou Sheng’an Package Company Limited. 

  Joint Venture
 In September 2015, our Textile Effects segment established Huntsman Pürsan Chemicals Kimya Sanayi ve Ticaret Limited Şirketi (“HPC”), a 60%-owned joint venture company in Turkey, for the formulation, sale and marketing of textile chemicals and dyes. HPC ceased operating in the third quarter of 2018. The shareholders of HPC are in the process of appointing a liquidator to liquidate the company.     Raw Materials
 The manufacture of textile effects products requires a wide selection of raw materials (approximately 1,000 different chemicals), including amines, ethoxylates, acrylics and sulfones. No one raw material represents greater than 5% of our textile effects raw material expenditures. Raw material costs constitute a sizeable percentage of sales for certain applications. We have tolling arrangements with several Chinese suppliers, but the majority of our raw materials are not purchased under long‑term contracts. The terms of our supply contracts vary, but, in general, these contracts contain provisions that set forth the quantities of product to be supplied and purchased.     Competition
 We are a major global solutions provider for textile chemicals, dyes and digital inks in our chosen markets. Competition within the textile chemicals and dyes markets is generally fragmented with few competitors who can offer complete solutions for the entire textile markets. Key competitors within dyes include Archroma, Longsheng, Runtu, Jihua and DyStar. Key competitors within textile chemicals include Archroma, DyStar, Transfar/Tannatex, CHT and Rudolf. Key competitors within digital inks include JK Group, Sensient/Xennia, DowDuPont, DyStar and SPG.
     We believe that our competitive strengths include our product offering, which is characterized by its broad and deep technology range, high quality, significant integration between products and service, reliable technical expertise, long‑standing relationships with customers, and strong business infrastructure in Asia. We are a leader in environmentally sustainable chemistry with products that help customers enhance efficiency and reduce their environmental footprint. We believe that we have more customer service capability and account management capability than any of our competitors worldwide. In addition, we engage regularly with downstream brands and retailers on industry and sustainability issues.
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 We support our business with a major commitment to research and development, technical services and process engineering improvement. Our research and development centers are located in The Woodlands, Texas; Everberg, 

 
  22

 
Belgium; and Shanghai, China. Other regional development/technical service centers are located in Auburn Hills, Michigan (polyurethanes for the automotive industry); Derry, New Hampshire, Shanghai, China, Deggendorf, Germany and Ternate, Italy (polyurethanes); Melbourne, Australia (surfactants); Port Neches, Texas (process engineering support); Basel, Switzerland and Panyu, China (advanced materials and textile effects); and Mumbai, India (textile effects).
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
 Proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses, and other technology and inventions is important to our businesses. We own approximately 2,850 unexpired patents and have approximately 1,160 patent applications (including provisionals) currently pending. While a presumption of validity exists with respect to issued U.S. patents, we cannot assure that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Furthermore, we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application, or that if patents do issue, that these patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. Additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner.
 We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know‑how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that confidentiality and other agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know‑how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know‑how. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means.
 In addition to our own patents and patent applications and proprietary trade secrets and know‑how, we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to use trade secrets, know‑how and related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities. We also have licensed or sub‑licensed intellectual property rights to third parties.
 We have associated brand names with a number of our products, and we have approximately 4,370 trademark registrations and 150 pending trademark applications globally. These registrations and applications include extensions of protection under the Madrid system for the international registration of marks. However, there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted.
 Because of the breadth and nature of our intellectual property rights and our business, we do not believe that any single intellectual property right (other than certain trademarks for which we intend to maintain the applicable registrations) is material to our business. Moreover, we do not believe that the termination of intellectual property rights expected to occur over the next several years, either individually or in the aggregate, will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 EMPLOYEES
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 10,000 associates in our operations around the world. Approximately 3,000 of these employees are located in the U.S., while approximately 7,000 are located in other countries. We believe our relations with our employees are good. ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
 General
 We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to occupational health and safety, process safety, pollution, protection of the environment and natural resources, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. Actual or alleged violations of safety laws, environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, or injunctions limiting or prohibiting our operations altogether. In addition, some environmental laws may impose liability on a strict, joint and several basis. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our 

 
  23

 
operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations and make significant environmental compliance expenditures. Accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. Information related to environmental, health and safety (“EHS”) matters may also be found in other areas of this report including “—Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Environmental Expenditures” to our consolidated financial statements and “Note 20. Environmental Health and Safety Matters” to our consolidated financial statements.
 Environmental, Health and Safety Systems
 We are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable EHS legal requirements, and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of EHS legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements, improve the safety of our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. We cannot guarantee, however, that these policies and systems will always be effective or that we will be able to manage EHS legal requirements without incurring substantial costs. Although EHS legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with, these EHS management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and reducing overall risk to us. Environmental Remediation
 We have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. Similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that was disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses. Under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources.
 In cases where our potential liability arises from historical contamination based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility, we frequently obtain an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre‑closing conditions. We have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites and, where applicable, mitigated our ultimate remediation liability. We cannot assure you, however, that the liabilities for all such matters subject to indemnity will be honored by the prior owner or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters.
 Based on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material effect on our financial statements. However, if such indemnities are not honored or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to such costs, then such expenditures may have a material effect on our financial statements. At the current time, we are unable to estimate the total cost, exclusive of indemnification benefits, to remediate contaminated sites.
 Regulatory Matters
 Greenhouse Gas Regulation and Climate Change
 Globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth’s climate. At the Durban negotiations of the Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in 2012, a limited group of nations, including the European Union (the “EU”), agreed to a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in GHG emissions. More significantly, the EU GHG Emissions Trading System (“ETS”), established pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol to reduce GHG emissions in the EU, continues in its third phase. The EU parliament has used a process to formalize “backloading”—the withholding of GHG allowances during the trading period from 2014 to 2016 with additional allowances auctioned during 2019 to 2020—to prop up carbon prices. As backloading is only a temporary measure, a sustainable solution to the imbalance between supply and demand requires structural changes to the ETS. The European Commission proposes to establish a market stability reserve to address the current surplus of allowances and improve the system’s resilience. The reserve will start operating in 2019. In addition, the EU has announced the binding target to reduce domestic GHG emissions by at least 40% below the 1990 level by 2030. The EU has set a binding target of increasing the share of renewable energy to at least 27% of the EU’s energy consumption by 2030, and additional proposals have been made to increase the target to 35%.
 In addition, at the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, the U.S. and nearly 200 other nations entered into an international climate agreement, which went into effect in November 2016 (the “Paris 

 
  24

 
Agreement”). Although the agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. However, in August 2017 the U.S. informed the United Nations that it is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process.
 Federal climate change legislation in the U.S. appears unlikely in the near‑term. As a result, domestic efforts to curb GHG emissions will continue to be led by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (the “EPA”) GHG regulations and similar programs of certain states. To the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the EPA’s GHG regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or expanded facilities. Significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the Clean Air Act’s (the “CAA”) requirements for pollutants regulated under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs. Some of our facilities are also subject to the EPA’s Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule, and any further regulation may increase our operational costs.
 We are already managing and reporting GHG emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to U.S. federal and state requirements, Kyoto Protocol obligations and/or ETS requirements. Although these sites are subject to existing GHG legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs, although it is possible that GHG emission restrictions may increase over time. Potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet GHG emission restrictions and/or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. Currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites.
 Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.
