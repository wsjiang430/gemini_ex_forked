Item 1. Business.
Overview
Digital Media Solutions, Inc. (“DMS Inc.” or the “Company” or “DMS” or “us”, “our” or “we”) is a leading provider of technology enabled digital performance advertising solutions connecting consumers and advertisers. Our performance-based ROI-driven business model derisks ad spend for advertisers which in turn positions DMS to grow as digital ad spend accelerates because advertisers are shifting more of their ad spend from traditional channels like TV and radio to digital channels, including social media, search, display, e-mail, push and connected TV. As used in this Annual Report, the “Company” refers to DMS Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, (including its wholly-owned subsidiary, CEP V DMS US Blocker Company, a Delaware corporation (“Blocker”)). 
The Company is headquartered in Clearwater, Florida. The Company primarily operates and derives most of its revenues in the United States.
Refer to Note . Business Combination in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for an overview of the Company’s background. 
Recent Developments
Strategic Alternatives
On August 16, 2021, we commenced a process to evaluate potential strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, and as part of that process, have been evaluating a full range of strategic, operational and financial alternatives. On September 8, 2022, our board of directors received an offer from Prism Data, LLC, an investment vehicle affiliated with our CEO Joseph Marinucci and our COO Fernando Borghese, to acquire all of our outstanding Class A common stock of DMS for $2.50 per share in cash. On March 6, 2023, the Company issued a press release announcing that its Board of Directors had concluded its strategic review and that the previously disclosed non-binding offer by Prism Data LLC to acquire the Company had been withdrawn. For further information, refer to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 10, 2023.
Recent Business Acquisition

On May 10, 2022, the Company acquired Traverse Data, Inc. (“Traverse”). Traverse is a marketing and advertising technology company. The Company paid cash consideration of $2.5 million upon closing of the transaction. The transaction also includes up to $0.5 million in contingent consideration, subject to the achievement of certain milestones, which is payable in cash 15 months after the acquisition date.

The transaction also includes up to $10 million in contingent consideration, subject to the achievement of certain milestones, to be paid two years after the acquisition date, subject to the operation of the acquired assets reaching certain milestone. The contingent consideration may be paid in cash or the Company’s Class A Common Stock, to be mutually agreed by DMS and the applicable recipients.

For further information, refer to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 19, 2022.
Human Capital
Our people are vital to our success in the digital marketing services industry. As a human-capital business, the long-term success of our firm depends on our people. We strive to make our employees feel as though they are a number one priority before other interests of the Company. Our goal is to ensure that we have the right talent, in the right place, at the right time. We do that through our commitment to attracting, developing and retaining our associates.
We strive to attract individuals who are people-focused and share our values. We have competitive programs dedicated to selecting new talent and enhancing the skills of our associates. In our recruiting efforts, we strive to have a diverse group of candidates to consider for our roles. To that end, we have strong relationships with a variety of industry associations that represent diverse professionals and with diversity groups on university and college campuses where we recruit. 
We have designed a compensation structure, including an array of benefit plans and programs, that we believe is attractive to our current and prospective associates. We also offer our associates the opportunity to participate in a variety of professional and leadership development programs. Our program includes a variety of industry, product, technical, professional, business development, and leadership trainings. 
We seek to retain our associates by using their feedback to create and continually enhance programs that support their needs. We have formal annual goal setting and performance review processes for our employees. We have a values-based culture, an important factor in retaining our associates, which is memorialized in a culture “blueprint” that is communicated to all associates. Our training to share and communicate our culture to all associates plays an important part in this process. We are committed to having a diverse workforce, and an inclusive work environment is a natural extension of our culture. We have recently renewed our commitment to ensuring that all our associates feel welcomed, valued, respected and heard so that they can fully contribute their unique talents for the benefit of clients, their careers, our firm and our communities. 
We take a proactive approach to philanthropy and driving meaningful change in the world, holding ourselves accountable to leading by example. On an individual level, we provide paid time-off opportunities for volunteering or donating to a cause that matters to each person. We monitor and evaluate various turnover and attrition metrics throughout our management teams. Our annualized voluntary turnover is relatively low, as is the case for turnover of our top performers, a record which we attribute to our strong values-based culture, commitment to career development, and attractive compensation and benefit programs. 
Since our technologies can be securely accessed remotely, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we transitioned to a fully remote workforce. Ongoing feedback from employee surveys indicate that our talent has embraced, and prefers to continue, working in a remote environment. We have prioritized virtual communications, wellness programs, and work-life balance adaptation that has increased engagement and supports our trust-first mentality. Recognizing safety as a priority, once safe to return, our people will have the opportunity to work at our headquarters. 
The Company is headquartered in Clearwater, Florida with approximately 454 employees as of December 31, 2022.
Disaggregation of Revenue 
The Company has three material revenue streams, which represents disaggregation of services for: (1) customer acquisition, (2) managed services and (3) software services (“SaaS”). 
•Customer acquisition - The process of identifying and cultivating potential customers (also known as customers or near customers otherwise known as leads) for our customer’s business products or services through impressions, clicks and direct messaging (email, push and text/SMS or short message service) based on predefined qualifying characteristics specified by the customer. Revenue is earned based on the cost per action (“CPA”) defined within the executed insertion order (“IO”) and/or agreed to with the customer.
•Managed Services - The management of a customer’s marketing spend and performance, through the utilization of proprietary software delivery platform. Revenue in certain cases, is earned based on a percentage (%) of the customer’s total media spend, which is recognized as a net revenue, while other revenue is recognized on a gross basis.

•Software Services (“SaaS”) - The application of propriety performance marketing software, which tracks lead counts, sources and channels, pricing and overall spend for each client. The software allows online real-time management of marketing activities and spend to attract potential applicants, sourced through various digital online methods. Revenue is earned by licensing the software to customers under a Software Services (“SaaS”) based contract.
Segments Revenue 
We classify our operations into three reportable segments: Brand Direct, Marketplace and Technology Solutions. 
Under the Brand Direct reportable segment, revenues are earned from fees we charge to our customers when we advertise directly for them under their brand name. In servicing our customers under this reportable segment, the end consumer of our customer interacts directly with our customer and does not interface with the Company’s brands at any point during the transaction process. Consumer journeys inside the Brand Direct reportable segment utilize the Company’s propriety tool set of Data, Process and Technology which operates in the background of these journeys.
Under the Marketplace reportable segment, we earn revenues from fees we charge to our customers when we advertise their business under our brand name. The end consumer interfaces directly with our brand and may be redirected to our customer based on information obtained during the transaction process. The Marketplace reportable segment utilizes the Company’s same propriety tool set of Data, Process and Technology as Brand Direct which operates in the background of these journeys.
Under the Technology Solutions reportable segment, we earn revenues from fees for other services provided to our customers such as the management of digital media services on behalf of our customers as well as our SaaS offering. Revenue in this segment is recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to customers, in amounts that reflect the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. Upon satisfaction of the associated performance obligation, the Company recognizes revenue.
Industry Overview
The Company operates as a digital performance marketing engine for companies across numerous industries, including insurance, consumer finance, e-commerce, home services, brand performance, health and wellness and education & career placements. We also operate in managed services that provide better access and control over the advertising spend of our customers, including marketing automation and SaaS. The vertical agnostic brand direct solutions approach allows the number of verticals we serve to expand the Total Addressable Market (“TAM”), and the balance of business across these industries protects our revenue stream from unpredictable market shifts, which we believe, in comparison, is a significant risk faced by vertical-specific, marketplace only companies.
Business Strategies
The Company is a premier digital performance-based marketing company offering a diversified array of digital advertising solutions. We are a major contributor to the structural shift from traditional media to the online and digital arena currently ongoing in the advertising industry. Through our cutting-edge technologies and multi-faceted platforms, the Company enables advertising customers to not only acquire new customers but also to more closely track, monitor and adjust marketing campaigns based on their return on investment.
Competition
The Company is a brand-direct solutions provider that offers a diversified set of advertising and customer acquisition solutions to a wide variety of industries, most comparable to adtech firms such as The TradeDesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) and LiveRamp Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: RAMP). As a complement to our industry-agnostic offerings, the Company has also developed marketplace solutions that are more vertically oriented to key markets such as insurance, finance, education, health and wellness, which are most comparable to marketplaces offered by EverQuote, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVER), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE: SLQT), LendingTree, Inc. (NASDAQ: TREE), QuinStreet, Inc. (NASDAQ: QNST), CarGurus, Inc. (NASDAQ: CARG), and eHealth, Inc. (NASDAQ: EHTH) but with less risk exposure to a single industry.
Customer Concentration
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, one advertising customer accounted for approximately 23.2% and 13.5% of our total revenues, respectively. We market for advertisers on our platform primarily through utilizing impressions, ad clicks, direct messaging to consumers, leads, and email to sales conversions, directly measuring results and providing accountability. Our initial contract terms for customer acquisition are typically one to three months. Managed services are typically signed for one-month terms with auto-renewal for subsequent period and revenue by licensing the Software to customers under SaaS-based contracts, which is typically one-month with auto-renewal for subsequent months. The large majority of our customers pay on a monthly basis. Our services are billed on a monthly basis for the services provided in the previous month. Our pricing method reflects the price and quantities for the service provided, which is driven by the volume of customer acquisition, includes access to our direct service, technical support and managed services infrastructure. We generally recognize revenues from our leads, services and software platform ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement. We do not charge third-

party suppliers who are on our platform to transact with our customers. We believe this approach helps attract more suppliers to our platform and increases the value of our platform.
Our Business
Management of high-quality targeted media sources
In the digital marketing solutions industry, it is essential that advertising service providers are able to acquire and retain high quality media sources that attract targeted users for advertiser customers on a large scale at low cost. This can be particularly challenging given the dynamic nature of the media resources available to advertising service providers. Frequent updates in search engine algorithms and consolidation of media sources result in high costs of retaining high quality media sources. This, combined with high levels of competition by a large number of service providers, drives up costs within the advertising industry.
To combat this challenge, we have built out a channel-agnostic media team that leverages our proprietary first party data asset to buy media, on both the Brand Direct and Marketplace solutions we offer, to connect ad units with consumers who have probability and intent to interact with those ad units. Additionally, we have formed strategic partnerships through acquisitions with other advertising and proprietary media marketing software providers to increase our access to high quality targeted media. Our acquisition of Traverse provide us access to proprietary software to drive meaningful engagement with advertising targets.
Regulation
Our domestic business is subject to a significant number of federal, state and local laws and regulations and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. We conduct marketing activities, directly and indirectly, via telephone, email and/or through other online and offline marketing channels, which activities are governed by numerous federal and state regulations, such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, state telemarketing laws, federal and state privacy laws, Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and the Federal Trade Commission Act and its accompanying regulations and guidelines, among others. We are also subject to regulation as a licensed insurance agency for Medicare insurance policies in certain states. In addition, we are subject to laws, rules and regulations regarding data collection, privacy and data security, charitable fundraising, and sweepstakes and promotions, among others. Some of our clients operate in regulated industries, such as financial services, credit repair, consumer and mortgage lending, healthcare and medical services and secondary education, and, to the extent applicable, we must comply with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to marketing activities in those industries.
Macroeconomic conditions
During 2020 and 2021, the U.S. economy increasingly suffered the adverse effects of the COVID-19 economic and health crisis. Macroeconomic factors, such as the level of interest rates, credit availability and the level of unemployment, including during economic downturns and global pandemics, all had an adverse impact on our customers’ costs of services and their demand for our services and our revenues. By late 2021, the auto insurance industry began to experience significant economic macro headwinds which resulted in 14 of the 20 largest private auto insurers experiencing double-digit declines in loss ratios.
Additionally, in 2022, persistent inflationary pressures leading to rising costs across all goods and services continued to intensify recessionary fears. Exceptional inflation and supply chain issues have continued to plague the insurance market as we experience unparalleled market volatility. Specifically, within the auto insurance industry, increased claims costs continue to suppress insurance carrier marketing spend extending the expected recovery as carriers remain cautious.
These and other difficulties faced by our customers have magnified due to hardships in the economy which could cause a reduction in their advertising budgets as they seek to manage expenses in general. Conversely, to an extent, we believe that the digital media advertising industry is also counter-cyclical to macroeconomic conditions since some customers increase their advertising and promotion efforts in times where consumers are more difficult to acquire. This enables us to ease the downward impact on our revenues during a downturn in the economy.
Role of Board of Directors in Risk Oversight Process
Our board of directors has responsibility for the oversight of our risk management and, either as a whole or through its audit committee, regularly discusses with management our risk management processes and major risk exposures, including their potential impact on our business and the steps we take to manage them. The risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from members of senior management to enable our board of directors to understand our risk identification, risk management and risk mitigation strategies with respect to areas of potential material risk, including operations, finance, legal, regulatory, cybersecurity, strategic and reputational risk.
