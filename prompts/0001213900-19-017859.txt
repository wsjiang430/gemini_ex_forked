Our Current Business
 
Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. is a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy product candidates for the treatment of multiple ischemic, inflammatory and hematologic conditions. Our lead indications are critical limb ischemia, or CLI, muscle recovery following surgery for hip fracture, and acute radiation syndrome, or ARS. Each of these indications is a severe unmet medical need. We were incorporated in Nevada in 2001, and have a wholly owned subsidiary in Israel called Pluristem Ltd. We operate in one segment and our operations are focused on the research, development, clinical trials and manufacturing of cell therapeutics and related technologies.


PLX cells are derived from a class of placental cells that are harvested from donated placenta at the time of full term healthy delivery of a baby. PLX cell products require no tissue matching prior to administration. They are produced using our proprietary three-dimensional expansion technology. Our manufacturing facility complies with the European, Japanese, Israeli, South Korean and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA’s, current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements and has been approved by the European and Israeli regulators for production of PLX-PAD for late stage trials. In December 2017, after an audit of our facilities, we were granted manufacturer/importer authorization and Good Manufacturing Practice Certification by Israel’s Ministry of Health. If we obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals to market PLX cells, we expect to have in-house production capacity to grow clinical-grade PLX cells in commercial quantities.
 
Our goal is to make significant progress with our clinical pipeline and our clinical pivotal trials in order to ultimately bring innovative, potent therapies to patients who need new treatment options. We expect to demonstrate a real-world impact and value from our pipeline, technology platform and commercial-scale manufacturing capacity. Our business model for commercialization and revenue generation includes, but is not limited to, direct sale of our products, partnerships, licensing deals, and joint ventures with pharmaceutical companies.
 
We aim to shorten the time to commercialization of our product candidates by leveraging unique accelerated regulatory pathways that exist in the United States, Europe and other territories to bring innovative products that address life-threatening diseases to the market efficiently. We believe that these accelerated pathways create substantial opportunities for us and for the cell therapy industry as a whole.
 
We have determined to invest our resources primarily on the PLX-PAD Phase III clinical trials relating to CLI and muscle recovery following surgery for hip fracture, and focus on finalizing the clinical trials in the United States, Europe and Israel while we prepare for the marketing phase, with the initiation of such marketing phase subject to regulatory approval, in these territories.
 
Two pivotal, Phase III multinational clinical trials are currently being conducted with our PLX-PAD product candidate: one in CLI, and the other in muscle recovery following surgery for hip fracture. In April 2019, we successfully enrolled over 50% of patients in our Phase III study in CLI, which allows for an interim analysis of efficacy after a one-year follow-up period under the European Medicines Agency’s, or EMA, Adaptive Pathways pilot project, or the Adaptive Pathways Project, in which PLX-PAD was selected to participate. Based on our current patient enrollment progress, we expect to complete the follow up of our Phase III study in CLI in the first half of 2020 with respect to Europe, and in the first half of 2021 with respect to the United States. In addition, based on our current patient enrollment progress, we expect to complete the efficacy follow up of our Phase III study in muscle recovery following surgery for hip fracture in the second half of 2020. We expect to release the clinical trial results shortly after the conclusion of the follow ups.
 
Our PLX-PAD cell program in CLI had been selected for the EMA’s Adaptive Pathways Project, Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, accelerated pathway, the FDA Fast Track Designation and FDA Expanded Access Program, or EAP, in the United States. The CLI program in the European Union was awarded a Euro 7,600,000 (approximately $8,700,000) grant as part of the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program and to date we have received a portion of such grant.
 
Our PLX-PAD cell program in muscle recovery following surgery for hip fracture was also selected for the EMA’s Adaptive Pathways Project and was awarded a Euro 7,400,000 (approximately $8,400,000) grant as part of the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program and to date we have received a portion of such grant.
 
Our second product candidate, PLX-R18, is under development in the United States for ARS via the FDA Animal Rule regulatory pathway, and, based on our assessment, is expected to advance to a pivotal trial, which may also result in approval without the prior performance of human efficacy trials. The National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has completed a dose selection trial with our PLX-R18 product candidate in the hematologic component of ARS. We are targeting to submit a proposal for a contract with the U.S. government in the second half of 2019 to fund an additional non-human primates, or NHPs study. We are also targeting to receive funding from BARDA for the full cost of the ARS pivotal trial during 2020.
 
PLX-R18 is also under development in the United States and Israel for the treatment of incomplete hematopoietic recovery following hematopoietic cell transplantation, or HCT. In March 2019, we announced that we had fully enrolled the second cohort of six patients in our ongoing Phase I clinical trial in HCT, and received data and safety monitoring board approval to continue to the final cohort of the trial. In September 2018, we announced that the FDA granted orphan drug designation to our PLX cell therapy for the treatment of graft failure and incomplete hematopoietic recovery following HCT.

Scientific Background
 
Cell therapy is an emerging field within the regenerative medicine area. The characteristics and properties of cells vary as a function of tissue source and growth conditions. The human placenta from which our PLX cells are derived provides an uncontroversial source of non-embryonic, adult cells and represents an innovative approach in the cell therapy field. The different factors that PLX cells release suggest that the cells can be used therapeutically for a variety of ischemic, inflammatory, autoimmune and hematological disorders.
 
PLX cells do not require tissue matching prior to administration. This allows for the development of ready-to-use / “off-the-shelf” allogeneic products.
 
Our Technology
 
We develop, and intend to commercialize, cell therapy production technologies and products that are derived from the human placenta. Our PLX cells are adherent stromal cells, or ASCs, that are expanded using a proprietary 3D process. This system utilizes a synthetic scaffold to create an artificial 3D environment where placental-derived stromal cells can grow. Our 3D process enables the large-scale monitored and controlled production of reproducible, high quality cell products and is capable of manufacturing a large number of PLX doses originating from different placentas. Additionally, our manufacturing process has demonstrated batch-to-batch consistency, an important manufacturing challenge for biological products.
Product Candidates
 
Our primary objective is to be the leading provider of allogeneic placenta based cell therapy products that are true off-the-shelf products that do not require any matching or additional manipulation prior to administration. From the physician’s and patient’s perspective, we believe that our PLX products are comparable to any other product delivered in a vial. Our PLX products are administered using a standard needle and syringe. Our PLX products are in clinical stage development for multiple indications.
 
Our first product candidate, PLX-PAD, is currently in a Phase III multinational clinical trial in CLI, and in a Phase III multinational clinical trial in recovery following surgery for hip fracture. We have also completed Phase II multinational clinical trial in intermittent claudication, or IC, and a Phase I/II is currently conducted with our PLX-PAD by Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) for the treatment of Steroid-Refractory Chronic Graft-Versus-Host-Disease.
 
Our second product candidate, PLX-R18, is under development in the United States for ARS via the FDA Animal Rule regulatory pathway, as well as in a Phase I trial in the United States and Israel for incomplete hematopoietic recovery following HCT.
 
Our third product candidate, PLX-Immune is under pre-clinical development for treatment of certain types of human cancer.
 
We believe that using the placenta as a unique cell source, combined with our innovative research, development and high-quality manufacturing capabilities, will be the “engine” that drives this platform technology towards the successful development of additional PLX cell therapy products and indications.

Our Clinical Development Product Candidates 
 
Peripheral and Cardiovascular Diseases – We are investigating the use of PLX-PAD cells for the treatment of various stages of peripheral arterial disease, or PAD, from early stage IC to advanced CLI.
 
In May 2015, our CLI clinical development program was selected for the EMA’s Adaptive Pathways Project. The goal of the project is to improve timely access for patients to new medicines. During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the FDA and several EU regulatory agencies cleared our application to begin the pivotal Phase III trial of PLX-PAD cells in the treatment of CLI for patients with minor tissue loss (Rutherford Category 5) who are unsuitable for revascularization. This multinational Phase III trial is being conducted in the United States, Europe and Israel. In September 2017, we announced that the FDA granted a fast track designation to our ongoing Phase III study of PLX-PAD for the treatment of CLI. The FDA’s fast track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drug to treat serious conditions and unmet medical needs. With fast track designation, there is an increased possibility for a priority review by the FDA of PLX-PAD cells for the treatment of CLI.
 
Our intention is to file a request for marketing authorization in the United States and in Europe following a successful completion of this 246-patient trial. In April 2019, we successfully enrolled over 50% of patients in our Phase III study in CLI, which allows for an interim analysis of efficacy after a one-year follow-up period. If the interim analysis yields positive results, it could lead to early conditional marketing approval in Europe.
 
In January 2018, we announced that the FDA cleared our EAP for the use of our PLX-PAD cell treatment in patients with CLI. In October 2018, we announced that the FDA approved cost recovery for our PLX-PAD under an EAP held by Wide Trial, Inc., or Wide Trial, a privately-held third-party sponsor. In April 2019, we announced the initiation of our FDA approved EAP, with several site initiations in the United States. Under the terms of the EAP, an initial cohort of 100 Rutherford-5 CLI patients who are ineligible for inclusion under our ongoing Phase III study protocol can be enrolled and treated.
 
We have completed two Phase I safety/dose-escalating clinical trials for CLI, one in the United States and one in Germany. These CLI trials demonstrated that no blood type or human leukocyte antigen matching is required, and that the administration of PLX-PAD cells is safe, even if two doses are administered to a patient on two different occasions. In addition, PLX-PAD cells are potentially effective in reducing the frequency of amputations in CLI patients. Generally, the FDA and the EMA require the primary endpoint for pivotal CLI clinical trials to be Amputation Free Survival, or AFS, at one year. The pooled data from the two studies we conducted suggest an AFS rate at one year of 86% in PLX-treated patients versus an AFS ranging between 48% to 66% in patients from placebo arms in other CLI trials.
 
In June 2018, we announced the results from our 172 patients, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, and multinational Phase II clinical trial in IC. Analysis of the Phase II IC data, which was announced on November 2018, confirmed the optimal dosing regimen of PLX-PAD in the treatment of PAD - two administrations of 300 million cells, each originating from a different donor. This is also the treatment regimen being administered to patients in the Company’s ongoing multinational Phase III study in CLI, a more severe stage of PAD. PLX-PAD treated patients showed a good safety profile in the study.
 
In April 2015, Japan’s PMDA approved our large-scale manufacturing methods and quality for PLX-PAD cells for use in clinical trials. In August 2015, the PMDA granted safety clearance to PLX-PAD cells for use in clinical trials in Japan, and in December 2015 we reached an agreement with the PMDA on the design of the final trial needed to apply for conditional marketing approval of PLX-PAD cells in the treatment of CLI. Currently, as part of our strategy to focus on our active clinical trials and marketing readiness, we have not initiated clinical trial activities in Japan.

Orthopedic Diseases – In April 2018, we announced that the FDA cleared our Investigational New Drug, or IND, for our Phase III trial for recovery following surgery for hip fracture. This multinational Phase III trial is being conducted in the United States, Europe and Israel. The EMA confirmed that recovery following surgery for hip fracture is eligible for the Adaptive Pathways Project as well.
 
Our Phase III trial protocol and design was based on our phase I/II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (n=20) to assess the safety and efficacy of intramuscular injections of allogeneic PLX-PAD cells for the regeneration of injured gluteal musculature after total hip replacement has been conducted in Germany under the approval of PEI. In this study, PLX-PAD cells or placebo were administered into the traumatized gluteal muscle during total hip replacement surgery. The study results met its primary efficacy endpoint, change in maximal voluntary isometric contraction force of the gluteal muscle at six months after total hip replacement. Patients treated with PLX-PAD had a significantly greater improvement of maximal voluntary muscle contraction force than the placebo group (p=0.0067). In addition, the study demonstrated that PLX-PAD was safe and well tolerated by the patients.
 
Recovery Following HCT – In March 2015, we reported positive data from three independent preclinical trials of PLX-R18. Results from these trials, as well as those from nineteen prior studies conducted by the NIAID, Case Western University, Cleveland, Ohio, and Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel, collectively suggest that PLX-R18 is safe and may improve outcomes after bone marrow failure and/or support hematopoietic cell transplantation. Data collected on the mechanism of action show that PLX-R18 acts by enhancing production of platelets and white and red blood cells in cases of severely damaged bone marrow, and may also accelerate engraftment of transplanted hematopoietic cells. In February 2018, we announced that a peer-reviewed journal published key animal findings from a study of PLX-R18 that demonstrate the cells’ efficacy in improving human hematopoietic engraftment. With these capabilities, PLX-R18 could potentially treat a broad range of indications related to bone marrow function which, taken together, constitute a substantial global market. 
 
PLX-R18 is under development in a Phase I clinical trial in the United States and Israel for incomplete hematopoietic recovery following HCT, which was initiated in fiscal year 2017.
 
ARS – We have conducted several animal studies for the evaluation of PLX-R18 for the treatment of ARS, in collaboration with the NIAID. The U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, funded and conducted a pilot study in NHPs to evaluate the therapeutic effect of PLX-R18 on hematological aspects of ARS. In May 2017, we announced results of the NHPs pilot study for PLX-R18 as a treatment for ARS. Although study size was not designed to show significance, results showed a trend toward improved survival of PLX-R18 treated animals compared to control, placebo treated animals. The study, conducted and funded by the NIAID, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of PLX-R18 following intramuscular injection into irradiated and non-irradiated NHPs. Efficacy measures included survival as well as hematological parameters which are affected by exposure to high levels of radiation as may occur in a nuclear accident or attack. These data will help the design of a pivotal study to fulfill the requirements for a Biologics License Application submission under the FDA’s Animal Rule regulatory pathway.
 
We plan to continue the discussions with the different government agencies with the goal of receiving their support for pivotal studies in large animals as well as conducting the safety studies required in order to file BLA for this indication.
 
In October 2017, we announced that the FDA granted us an orphan drug designation for our PLX-R18 cell therapy for the prevention and treatment of ARS.
 
In April 2018, we announced that the FDA approved our IND application for PLX-R18 cell therapy in the treatment of ARS. The IND allows us to treat victims who may have been acutely exposed to high dose radiation due to nuclear attack or accident.

In December 2015, we also signed a Memorandum of Understanding for a collaboration with Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima Global Medical Science Center. The purpose of the collaboration is to develop our PLX-R18 cells for the treatment of ARS, and for morbidities following radiotherapy in cancer patients. In June 2018, we reported positive animal data from studies conducted in collaboration with Fukushima Medical University evaluating PLX-R18 cells as a treatment for radiation damage to the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract and bone marrow. Data from these studies showed that PLX-R18 cells significantly increased survival rates, preserved GI stem cells activity that enhance the recovery of the GI system and prevented severe damage to the intestinal lining, suggesting PLX-R18 potential as a multi-organ therapy for ARS.
 
In July 2019, we presented positive results from a series of studies of our PLX-R18 cell therapy product conducted by the U.S. Department of Defense’s, or DoD, Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, part of the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences. The studies were designed to evaluate PLX-R18 as a potential prophylactic countermeasure against ARS administered prior to radiation exposure. These animal studies demonstrate that PLX-R18, administered 24 hours before radiation exposure, and again 72 hours after exposure, resulted in a significant increase in survival rates, from 4% survival rate in the placebo group to 74% in the treated group. In addition, the data show an increase in recovery of blood lineages and a favorable safety profile. Furthermore, histopathological analysis and hematopoietic progenitor clonogenic assay of tissues collected show a significant increase in bone marrow cell numbers and improved regenerative capability into all blood lineages.
 
Other Indications – In September 2017, we signed an agreement with Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) to conduct a clinical Phase I/II trial of PLX-PAD cell therapy for the treatment of Steroid-Refractory Chronic Graft-Versus-Host-Disease. This trial is an investigator initiated study. As such, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center supports the study and is responsible for its design and implementation.
 
In January 2018, we announced the publication of a peer-reviewed article in a journal which examined the effect of PLX-Immune cells on the proliferation of over 50 lines of human cancerous cells. Data showed that the PLX-Immune cells exhibited an anti-proliferative effect on a wide range of human cancer cell types, with a strong inhibitory effect on various lines of breast, colorectal, kidney, liver, lung, muscle and skin cancers. We have also conducted a pre-clinical trial of female mice harboring human triple negative breast cancer. In this study, the results showed a statistically significant reduction in tumor size as well as complete tumor remission in 30% of treated recipients.
 
In June 2018, we announced that we entered into collaboration with the U.S. DoD and its United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense to study PLX-R18 in the treatment of long term lung injuries following exposure to mustard gas. These non-clinical trials will be funded by the NIH.
 
In January 2019, we announced a successful one-year follow up of a compassionate use treatment in a Buerger’s disease patient treated with our PLX-PAD cell therapy.
 
Regulatory and Clinical Affairs Strategy 
 
Our cell therapy development strategy is to hold open and frequent discussions with regulators at all stages of development from preclinical trials to more advanced regulatory stages. We utilize this strategy in working with the FDA, the EMA, Germany’s PEI as well as other European national competent authorities, the Israeli Minister of Health, or MOH and Japan’s PMDA, and we are also working with the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MFDS, of South Korea authority via our collaborator, CHA.
 
The Adaptive Pathways Project is part of the EMA’s efforts to improve timely access for patients to new therapies. It targets treatments with the potential to heal serious conditions with an unmet medical need, and may reduce the time to a medicine’s approval or to its reimbursement for targeted patient groups. The pilot is open to clinical programs in early stages of development only. After a therapy is selected for the program, the Adaptive Pathways Project’s discussion group provides detailed guidance to the applicant regarding the formal regulatory processes that precede a trial targeting early approval and further expansion of the indications. We have applied early to this program and have been selected for it.

In September 2017, we announced that the FDA granted “Fast Track” designation for PLX-PAD in CLI. The FDA’s Fast Track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and unmet medical needs. With Fast Track designation, there is an increased possibility for a priority review by the FDA of PLX-PAD cells for the treatment of CLI.
 
In January 2018, we announced that the FDA cleared our EAP for the use of our PLX-PAD cell treatment in patients with CLI. In October 2018, we announced that the FDA approved cost recovery for our PLX-PAD under an EAP held by Wide Trial, a privately-held third-party sponsor. EAP allows the use of an investigational medical product outside of clinical trials and is usually granted in cases where patients are unsuitable for inclusion under the study protocol and the patient’s condition is life-threatening with an unmet medical need. As part of the EAP, our PLX-PAD cell therapy is available to a limited number of CLI patients in the United States who are unsuitable for revascularization and cannot take part in the our ongoing Phase III clinical trial.

Research and Development 
 
Foundational Research 
 
Our initial technology, the PluriX™ Bioreactor system, was invented at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology’s Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, in collaboration with researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science. This technology has been further significantly developed by our research and development teams over the ensuing years.
Collaborations and Ongoing Research and Development Plans 
 
Charité Agreement


In July 2007, we entered into a five-year collaborative research agreement with the Berlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies at Charité - University Medicine Berlin, or Charité. In August 2012, we extended our collaborative research agreement with Charité for a period of five years through 2017.

We signed an MOU for a collaboration with Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima Global Medical Science Center. The purpose of the collaboration is to develop Pluristem’s PLX-R18 cells for the treatment of ARS, and for morbidities following radiotherapy in cancer patients. The collaboration will proceed alongside research supported by the NIH, which is studying PLX-R18 as a potential treatment for the hematologic component of ARS. The MOU for a collaboration with Fukushima will be renewed automatically on a yearly basis. Each party is entitled to terminate the agreement for convenience upon providing the other party 30 days prior notice.
 
CHA Agreement
 
On June 26, 2013, we entered into an exclusive out-licensing and commercialization agreement, or the CHA Agreement, with CHA Biotech Co. Ltd., or CHA, for conducting clinical trials and commercialization of our PLX-PAD product in South Korea in connection with two indications: the treatment of CLI and IC. We will continue to retain rights to our proprietary manufacturing technology and cell-related intellectual property.
 
The first clinical trial that was performed as part of the CHA Agreement was a Phase II trial in IC. Upon the first regulatory approval for a PLX product in South Korea, if granted, for the specified indications, we and CHA will establish an equally owned joint venture with the purpose of commercializing PLX cell products in South Korea. Additionally, we will be able to use the data generated by CHA to pursue the development of PLX product candidates outside of South Korea.
 
The term of the CHA Agreement extends from June 24, 2013 until the later of the expiration, lapse, cancellation, abandonment or invalidation of the last valid patent claim covering the development of the product indications. The CHA Agreement contains customary termination provisions, including in the event that the parties do not reach an agreement upon a development plan for conducting the clinical trials.
 
Upon termination of the CHA Agreement, the license granted thereunder will terminate, and all rights included therein will revert to us, whereupon we will be free to enter into agreements with any other third parties for the granting of a license in or outside South Korea or to deal in any other manner with such rights as it shall see fit in our sole discretion.

In-House Clinical Manufacturing 
 
We have the in-house capability to perform clinical cell manufacturing. Our state-of-the-art GMP grade manufacturing facility in Haifa has been in use since February 2013 for the main purpose of clinical grade, large-scale manufacturing. The facility’s new automated manufacturing process and products were approved for production of PLX-PAD for clinical use by the FDA, EMA, Korean MFDS, PMDA and the Israeli MOH. Our second product, PLX R18, was cleared by the FDA and the Israeli Ministry of Health for clinical use. Furthermore, the site was inspected and approved by an EU qualified person (European accreditation body), approving that the site and production processes meet the current GMP for the purpose of manufacturing clinical grade products.
 
The site was also inspected and approved by Israel’s Ministry of Health and we received a GMP certification and manufacturer-importer authorization. Following the clinical approval of the facility, we are moving forward with our planned clinical trials based on cells manufactured in the new, efficient and improved manufacturing processes.
 
We obtain the human placentas used for our research and manufacturing activities from various hospitals in Israel after receiving a written informed consent by the mother and pathogen clearance. Any medical waste related to the use of placentas is treated in compliance with local environmental laws and standards.
 
In June 2019, we announced that we developed a serum-free formulation to support the manufacturing of cell therapy products. This serum-free formulation was developed using our deep understanding in cell therapy industrial scale production standards, and the quality methods designed to support implementation in Phase III development and marketing. Achieving this significant technological challenge is expected to provide us with large-scale, highly-consistent production capacity with operational independency from third party suppliers for standard serum, an expensive and quantity limited product. PLX-R18 is the first product candidate that we intend to manufacture using the serum-free media, which is expected to be followed by PLX-PAD.
 
Government Regulation
 
The development, manufacturing, and marketing of our cell therapy product candidates are subject to the laws and regulations of governmental authorities in the United States and the European Union as well as other countries in which our products will be marketed in the future like Japan, Israel and South Korea. In addition, the manufacturing conditions are specifically inspected by the Israeli Ministry of Health.
 
The FDA in the United States and the EMA in Europe must approve the product for marketing. Furthermore, various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage and record keeping related to such products and their marketing. Governments in other countries have similar requirements for testing and marketing.
 
The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time, resources and money. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will ultimately receive marketing approval, or, if approved, will be reimbursed by public and private health insurance.

There are several stages every drug has to go through during its development process. Among these are:
 

● | Performance of nonclinical laboratory and animal studies to assess a drug’s biological activity and to identify potential safety problems, and to characterize and document the product’s chemistry, manufacturing controls, formulation, and stability. In accordance with regulatory requirements, nonclinical safety and toxicity studies are conducted under Good Laboratory Practice requirements to ensure their quality and reliability; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The manufacture of the product according to GMP regulations and standards; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potential post-marketing clinical testing and surveillance of the product after marketing approval, which can result in additional conditions on the approvals or suspension of clinical use. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Approval of a drug for clinical trials in humans and approval of marketing are sovereign decisions of states, made by national, or, in case of the European Union, international regulatory competent authorities.
 
The Regulatory Process in the United States
 
In the United States, our product candidates are subject to regulation as a biological product under the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA, regulating the approval of clinical trials and marketing applications in the United States, generally requires the following steps prior to approving a new biological product either for clinical trials or for commercial sale:

● | Submission of an Investigational New Drug Application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, of research institutions or other clinical sites to introduce the drug candidate into humans in clinical trials; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA may grant approval for EAP prior to the completion of clinical trials, in order to allow access for the investigational drug, for patients that are excluded from the study. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA may grant priority review status, in order to expedite the Biologics License Application, or BLA, review process. Obtaining of a Fast Track designation allows access for the request of priority review. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing authorization of the product, which must include adequate results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission of BLA with a proof of efficacy that is based only on animal studies, where human efficacy studies cannot be conducted because the conduct of such trials is unethical and field trials after an accidental or deliberate exposure are not feasible. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review of the BLA in order to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility at which the product will be manufactured. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Regulatory Process in Europe
 
In the European Union, our investigational cellular products are regulated under the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product regulation, a regulation specific to cell and tissue products. This European Union regulation requires:

● | Filing a Clinical Trial Application via a centralized procedure, which makes it possible to obtain a coordinated assessment of an application for a clinical trial that is to take place in several European countries; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obtaining approval of affiliated ethics committees of clinical sites to test the investigational product into humans in clinical trials; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for its intended use; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Since our investigational cellular products are regulated under the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product regulation, the application for marketing authorization to the EMA is mandatory within the 28 member states of the EU. The EMA is expected to review and approve the marketing authorization application. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In April 2015, the EMA designated PLX-PAD as a tissue-engineered product.
 
In April 2015, the Pediatric Committee of the EMA granted PLX-PAD a waiver for the requirement to submit a pediatric investigational plan for all indications falling under “treatment of peripheral atherosclerosis”, including IC and CLI.
 
In May 2015, we were selected by EMA for development of PLX-PAD cells via the EMA Adaptive Pathways Project, with the potential to reach the market several years faster than the traditional regulatory approval pathway. Representatives of the Adaptive Pathways Project at the EMA are advising us with respect to the clinical development of PLX-PAD in CLI and in recovery following surgery for hip fracture.
 
Other Regulations

In general, the approval procedure varies among countries, and may involve additional preclinical testing and clinical trials. The requirements and time required may differ from those required for FDA or EMA approval. Each country may impose certain procedures and requirements of its own. Most countries other than the United States, the European Union and Japan are willing to consider requests for marketing approval only after the product had been approved for marketing by either the FDA, the EMA or the PMDA. The decision regarding marketing approval is made following the submission of a dossier that is thoroughly assessed and critically addressed.
 
In Japan, we have completed the required regulatory interactions with the PMDA, prior to the submission of clinical trial notification, in the framework of the new regulations for regenerative therapy effective in November 2014, which promote expedited approval for regenerative therapies that are being developed for seriously debilitating/life-threatening indications.
 
Clinical Trials
 
Typically, in the United States, as well as in the European Union, clinical testing involves a three-phase process, although the phases may overlap. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers, or patients in cases of ethical issues with using healthy volunteers, and are designed to provide information about product safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body.
 
In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with a homogenous group of patients afflicted with the specific target disease, in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. Phase III clinical trials are generally large-scale, multi-center, controlled trials conducted with a heterogeneous group of patients afflicted with the target disease, in order to provide statistically valid proof of efficacy, as well as safety and potency. The Phase III trials represent the trials that are considered for confirmation of efficacy and safety and are the most important ones for the approval. In some circumstances, a regulatory agency may require Phase IV, or post-marketing trials if it feels that additional information needs to be collected about the drug after it is on the market.
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators to minimize risks. The sponsor of a clinical trial is required to submit an annual safety report to the relevant regulatory agencies, in which serious adverse events must be reported, and also to submit in an expedited manner any individual serious adverse events that are suspected to be related to the tested drug. An agency may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the clinical trial based upon the data that have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient.

Employees
 
We presently employ a total of 160 full-time employees and 5 part-time employees, of whom 131 full-time employees and 5 part-time employees are engaged in research and development, manufacturing and clinical trials.
Competition 
 
The regenerative medicine field is characterized by intense competition, as global pharma players are becoming more engaged in the cell therapy field based on the advancements made in clinical trials and due to the new favorable regenerative medicine legislation in certain regions. We face competition from both allogeneic and autologous cell therapy companies, academic, commercial and research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, biopharmaceutical companies, and governmental agencies. Some of the clinical indications we currently have under development are also being investigated in preclinical and clinical programs by others.
 
While there are hundreds of companies in the regenerative medicine space globally, there are multiple participants in the cell therapy field based in the United States, Europe, Japan, Korea, and Australia such as Athersys, Inc., Capricor Therapeutics, Inc., Celularity – a spin-off of Celgene Corporation, Tigenix NV (acquired by Takeda), SanBio Inc., Healios K.K., Cytori Therapeutics, Cesca. and Mesoblast LTD. Among other things, we expect to compete based upon our intellectual property portfolio, our in-house manufacturing efficiencies and capabilities, and the efficacy of our products. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain experienced and skilled executives, scientific and clinical development personnel, to identify and develop viable cellular therapeutic candidates, and exploit these products commercially. Given the magnitude of the potential opportunity for cell therapy, we expect competition in this area to intensify.
