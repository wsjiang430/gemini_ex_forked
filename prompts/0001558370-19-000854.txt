 Item 1.  Business
 Overview
 Exact Sciences Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Exact,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is a molecular diagnostics company focused on the early detection and prevention of some of the deadliest forms of cancer. We have developed an accurate, non-invasive, patient-friendly screening test called Cologuard® for the early detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancer, and we are currently working on the development of additional tests for other types of cancer, with the goal of becoming a leader in cancer screening and diagnostics. Our Cologuard Test
 Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States (“U.S.”) and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. among non-smokers. Each year in the U.S. there are approximately:
· | 146,000 new cases of colorectal cancer
--+---------------------------------------


· | 51,000 deaths from colorectal cancer
--+-------------------------------------

      It is widely accepted that colorectal cancer is among the most preventable, yet least prevented cancers. Colorectal cancer can take up to 10-15 years to progress from a pre-cancerous lesion to metastatic cancer and death. Patients who are diagnosed early in the progression of the disease—with pre-cancerous lesions or polyps or early-stage cancer—are more likely to have a complete recovery and to be treated less expensively. Of the more than 85 million people between the ages of 50 and 85, who are at average-risk for colorectal cancer in the U.S., 38 percent have not been screened according to current guidelines. Internal studies have shown that approximately 50% of Cologuard users were previously unscreened for colorectal cancer. Poor compliance with screening guidelines has meant that nearly two-thirds of colorectal cancer diagnoses are made in the disease’s late stages. The five-year survival rates for stages 3 and 4 are 70 percent and 13 percent, respectively. We believe the large underserved population of unscreened and inadequately screened patients represents a significant opportunity for a patient-friendly screening test.
     Our Cologuard test is a non-invasive stool-based DNA (“sDNA”) screening test that utilizes a multi-target approach to detect DNA and hemoglobin biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Eleven biomarkers are targeted that have been shown to be strongly associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Methylation, mutation, and hemoglobin results are combined in the laboratory analysis through a proprietary algorithm to provide a single positive or negative reportable result.
     Changes in DNA methylation, and the occurrence of mutations, alter gene expression and other mechanisms for cell cycle regulation and differentiation. As a result, the affected cells continue to proliferate, often resulting in malignancies associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Hemoglobin is the protein complex responsible for transporting oxygen in red blood cells. During the progression of cancer, the probability of bleeding into the colon increases. The presence of hemoglobin, released from red blood cells, can be detected in the stool. Using sDNA Cologuard purifies, amplifies and detects increased levels of methylation, and presence of mutations, in specific genes. By combining these DNA indicators with a test for hemoglobin, Cologuard produces a multi-marker result effective for the detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancerous adenomas.
     In August 2014 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted premarket approval (“PMA”) to Cologuard for use as a colorectal cancer screening test in adults 50 years of age and older who are at average-risk for colorectal cancer. Upon approval, Cologuard became the first and only FDA-approved sDNA non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test. Our original PMA submission to the FDA for Cologuard included the results of our pivotal DeeP-C clinical trial that had over 10,000 patients enrolled at 90 sites in the U.S. and Canada. The results of our DeeP-C clinical trial for Cologuard were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2014. The peer-reviewed study, “Multi-target Stool DNA Testing for Colorectal-Cancer Screening,” highlighted the performance of Cologuard in the trial population:
    
· | Cancer Sensitivity: 92%
--+------------------------


· | Stage I and II Cancer Sensitivity: 94%
--+---------------------------------------


· | High-Grade Dysplasia Sensitivity: 69%
--+--------------------------------------


· | Specificity: 87%
--+-----------------

     We believe the competitive advantages of sDNA screening may provide a significant market opportunity. There are 85 million people in the U.S. between the ages of 50-85 who are at average risk for colorectal cancer. At a three-year screening interval and an average revenue per test of $500 this represents a potential $14 billion market for Cologuard, of which our current share is approximately four percent.
    
Our Cologuard Commercialization Strategy
     Our commercialization strategy includes three main elements focusing on physicians, patients, and payers.
     Physicians and Patients        Our sales team actively engages with physicians and their staffs to emphasize the need for colorectal cancer screening, educate them on the value of Cologuard, and facilitate their ability to order the test. We focus on specific physicians based on a combination of Cologuard order history and ordering potential. We also focus on physician groups and larger regional and national health systems. We recently expanded our physician engagement and Cologuard marketing campaign through a Promotion Agreement (“Promotion Agreement”) with Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”). The Promotion Agreement is discussed in more detail below.
     Securing inclusion in guidelines and quality measures is a key part of our physician engagement strategy since many physicians rely on such guidelines and quality measures when making screening recommendations. In June 2016, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (“USPSTF”) issued an updated recommendation statement for colorectal cancer screening and gave an "A" grade to colorectal cancer screening starting at age 50 and continuing until age 75. The statement specifies seven screening methods, including FIT-DNA, and Cologuard is the only version of FIT-DNA available in the U.S.
     Many professional colorectal cancer screening guidelines in the U.S., including those of the American Cancer Society (“ACS”) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”), recommend regular screening using any of a variety of methods. Since 2008, joint colorectal cancer screening guidelines endorsed by the ACS have included sDNA screening technology as a screening option for the detection of colorectal cancer in average risk, asymptomatic individuals starting at age 50. In October 2014, the ACS updated its colorectal cancer screening guidelines to specifically include Cologuard as a recommended screening test and, as further discussed below, in May 2018 the ACS updated its colorectal cancer screening guidelines to recommend colorectal cancer screening begin at age 45 for people at average risk of the disease. In June 2016, the NCCN updated its Colorectal Cancer Screening Guidelines to add sDNA screening, at a once-every-three-years interval, to its list of recommended screening tests. 
     In May 2018, the ACS updated its guidelines to recommend colorectal cancer screening beginning at age 45, rather than 50, for people at average risk of the disease due to the rising incidence rate within the 45-49 year-old population. There are 21 million people who are within the ages of 45-49, and we estimate approximately 19 million of them are at average risk for colorectal cancer and eligible for screening. Cologuard is currently indicated for average risk individuals age 50 years or older. We intend to seek FDA approval to expand Cologuard’s indication to people age 45 or older who are at average risk for colorectal cancer to align with the ASC updated guideline. We cannot be certain that FDA will grant such approval, or, if it does, when. Further, even if FDA does approve a label expansion, we cannot be certain that healthcare providers will prescribe, patients will use, or payers will reimburse Cologuard in the 45-49 age population.
     In October 2016, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”) included sDNA testing on a three-year interval as one of the methods permitted for colorectal cancer screening in the 2017 Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS”) quality measures. More than 90 percent of America’s health plans measure quality based on HEDIS. In April 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) included Cologuard in its updated 2018 Medicare Advantage Star Ratings program.
     A critical part of the value proposition of Cologuard is its compliance program, which involves active engagement with patients and providers. This customer-oriented support activity is focused on encouraging and helping patients to complete Cologuard tests that have been ordered for them by their providers. We may undertake several activities to promote patient compliance including letters, text messages, emails, phone calls, and incentives such as gift cards.
     After the launch of Cologuard, we initiated a significant public relations effort to engage patients in the U.S., and 

 
  5

 
launched demographically-targeted direct-to-patient advertising campaigns in digital, social, print, and other channels. In 2016, we began a national television advertising campaign, with a majority of placements in national cable and syndicated programming widely viewed by our target patient demographic. In the second quarter of 2018, we extended our television advertising campaign to highlight the accuracy, ease of use, and commercial coverage of Cologuard. In 2019 we plan to increase our television advertising efforts, accelerate our investment in digital and social media, and embark upon other marketing initiatives designed to increase awareness of Cologuard. 
     We are focused on strengthening our Cologuard core business by increasing the size of our nationwide salesforce. We advanced this goal in August 2018 by entering into a Promotion Agreement with Pfizer. Under the terms of the Promotion Agreement, Pfizer will promote Cologuard and provide certain sales, marketing, analytical and other commercial operations support services. We and Pfizer committed in the Promotion Agreement to invest specified amounts in the advertising and promotion of Cologuard. We agreed to pay Pfizer a service fee based on incremental gross profits over specified baselines and pay Pfizer royalties for Cologuard related revenues for a specified period after the expiration or termination of the Promotion Agreement. The initial term of the Promotion Agreement runs through December 31, 2021, but may be terminated by either party at any time on or after February 21, 2020 upon six months’ written notice to the other party. 
     Payers
     Successful commercialization of our Cologuard test depends, in large part, on adequate reimbursement from government insurance plans, managed care organizations and private insurance plans.
     In October 2014, CMS issued a National Coverage Determination (“NCD”) for Cologuard following a parallel review process with the FDA. Medicare covers approximately half of patients in the current screening population for Cologuard. Cologuard was the first screening test approved by the FDA and covered by CMS through a parallel process. As outlined in the NCD, Medicare Part B covers Cologuard once every three years for beneficiaries who meet all of the following criteria:
· | age 50 to 85 years,
--+--------------------


· | asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of colorectal disease including, but not limited to, lower gastrointestinal pain, blood in stool, positive guaiac fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test), and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | at average risk for developing colorectal cancer (e.g., no personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis; no family history of colorectal cancers or adenomatous polyps, familial adenomatous polyposis or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”) for both 2018 and 2019 set the CMS reimbursement rate for Cologuard at $508.87. Under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”), payment rates for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests are calculated based on the volume-weighted median of private payer rates for each clinical diagnostic laboratory test based on data submitted by certain applicable laboratories. The current CMS reimbursement rate was set based on the volume-weighted median of private payer rates for Cologuard for the period from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016. Based on current PAMA regulations, we expect that the current CMS reimbursement rate for Cologuard will remain in place until January 2021, and then will be reset based on the volume-weighted median of private payer rates for Cologuard during the data collection period from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019. 
     Pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, Medicare payments, including Medicare’s $508.87 reimbursement for Cologuard, became subject to a payment reduction of up to 2% due to implementation of the automatic expense reductions (i.e., a sequestration). The reduction is made to the total claims paid to plans and providers. Sequestration does not, however, rebase or re-establish the Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates.
     In addition to Medicare reimbursement, we seek to secure favorable coverage and in-network reimbursement agreements from commercial payers. Most commercial payers have issued positive coverage decisions for Cologuard, and we have entered into contracts with several payers to include Cologuard as an in-network service. In-network agreements with payers have varying terms and conditions, including reimbursement rate, term and termination. From time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may enter into new agreements, certain existing agreements may expire without renewal and certain other existing agreements may be terminated early by us or the third-party payer. We 

 
  6

 
believe that commercial payers’ reimbursement of Cologuard will depend on a number of factors, including payers’ determination that it is: sensitive and specific for colorectal cancer; not experimental or investigational; approved or recommended by major organizations’ guidelines; reliable, safe and effective; medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; and cost-effective. Reimbursement may also be affected by whether Cologuard is in-network for a given payer. Also, some payers may apply various medical management requirements, including a requirement that they give prior authorization for a Cologuard test before they are willing to pay for it. Other payers may perform post-payment reviews or audits, which could lead to payment recoupments. Medical management, such as prior authorizations and post-payment review or audits, may require that we, patients, or physicians provide the payer with extensive medical records and other information. 
     Coverage of Cologuard may also depend, in whole or in part, on whether payers determine, or courts and/or regulatory authorities determine, coverage is required under applicable federal or state laws mandating coverage of certain colorectal cancer screening services. For example, Section 2713 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) mandates that certain health insurers cover evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of “A” or “B” in the current recommendations of USPSTF without imposing any patient cost-sharing (“ACA Mandate”). Similarly, federal regulations require that Medicare Advantage plans cover “A” or “B” rated preventive services without patient cost-sharing. Following the June 2016 update to the USPSTF colorectal cancer screening recommendation statement, CMS issued an updated Evidence of Coverage notice for Medicare Advantage plans that affirms such plans must include coverage of Cologuard every three years without patient cost-sharing. While we believe the ACA Mandate will require most health insurers to cover Cologuard without patient cost-sharing certain health insurers have disagreed and determined not to cover Cologuard and others may take that position in the future. It may be difficult for us or patients to enforce the ACA Mandate directly, and we may need to rely on states to take enforcement action, which they may choose not to do. 
     It is also possible that the ACA Mandate will be repealed, overturned or significantly modified in the future. Congress may modify or repeal all or part of the ACA, and any such modification or repeal may repeal or limit the ACA Mandate for preventive services. Additionally, the ACA has been the subject of various legal challenges, which, if ultimately successful, could overturn the ACA Mandate. In December 2018, a federal district court in Texas held that the ACA is unconstitutional and unenforceable.  The court’s decision is subject to appeal.        Similarly, we believe the laws of approximately 30 states currently mandate coverage of Cologuard by certain health insurance plans. While some insurers have agreed with our interpretation regarding certain state mandates, other insurers have disagreed. In some cases, we have filed lawsuits in an effort to enforce state laws we believe require coverage of Cologuard, and we may file additional suits in the future.  We may or may not be successful in any such lawsuit.
     We are pursuing a variety of strategies to maximize commercial payer coverage for Cologuard, including providing cost effectiveness data to payers to make the case for Cologuard reimbursement. We are focusing our efforts on large national and regional insurers and health plans that have affiliated health systems. 
     We believe quality metrics may influence payers’ coverage and contracting decisions, as well as physicians’ cancer screening procedures. Some government and private payers are adopting pay-for-performance programs that differentiate payments for healthcare services based on the achievement of documented quality metrics, cost efficiencies or patient outcomes. Payers may look to quality measures, such as HEDIS and CMS Star Ratings, to assess quality of care. We believe Cologuard’s inclusion in the HEDIS measures and Star Ratings measures positively impacts payers’ willingness to reimburse Cologuard, as well as on healthcare providers’ willingness to prescribe the test. 

Our Clinical Laboratory and Manufacturing Facilities
 As part of our commercialization strategy, we established a state-of-the-art, highly automated lab facility that is certified pursuant to federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) requirements to process Cologuard tests and provide patient results. Our commercial lab operation is housed in a 55,000 square foot facility in Madison, Wisconsin. At our lab, we currently have the capacity to process approximately three million tests per year. 
     During the fourth quarter of 2017 we began construction of a new clinical lab facility in Madison, Wisconsin that is expected to be completed mid-2019. After the new clinical laboratory is operational, we expect our total lab capacity at both facilities will be approximately seven million tests per year by the end of 2019.

     We currently manufacture the Cologuard test in a facility in Madison, Wisconsin. As we expand the commercialization of Cologuard, we believe it will be necessary to expand our manufacturing capacity. Accordingly, we are in the process of building an additional manufacturing facility which we expect to complete in 2019. We are committed to manufacturing and providing medical devices and related products that meet customer expectations and applicable regulatory requirements.  We adhere to manufacturing and safety standards required by federal, state, and local laws and regulations and operate our manufacturing facilities under a quality management system. We purchase certain components for our Cologuard test from third-party suppliers and manufacturers.  
     Future Product Opportunities
 Enhance Cologuard
 In May 2018, the ACS updated its guidelines to recommend colorectal cancer screening beginning at age 45, rather than 50, for people at average risk of the disease due to the rising incidence rate within the 45-49 year-old population.  There are nearly 21 million people who are between the ages of 45-49, and we estimate approximately 19 million of them are at average risk for colorectal cancer and would be eligible for screening under the ACS guidelines. We plan to conduct clinical and other necessary work to gain FDA approval to expand Cologuard’s indication to people between the ages of 45 and 49 who are at average risk for colorectal cancer. 
 In addition, we are seeking opportunities to improve upon Cologuard’s performance characteristics. For example, we are evaluating whether new biomarkers would increase specificity while maintaining sensitivity. If we could increase the specificity of Cologuard, we believe that would enhance its adoption as a front-line screening test. We are also evaluating ways that we might make Cologuard even easier for patients to use and opportunities for lowering the cost of providing Cologuard. 
 The timing of any expansion of Cologuard’s indication or of any such enhancements to Cologuard is unknown and would be subject to FDA approval.
 Advance Liquid Biopsy
 We also are focusing our research and development efforts on building a pipeline of potential future products and services with a focus on blood-based (“liquid biopsy”) tests. We will continue to advance liquid biopsy through biomarker discovery and validation in tissue and blood. We have identified proprietary biomarkers for several cancers, including liver cancer and lung cancer. We have successfully performed validation studies on tissue samples for thirteen cancers and on blood samples for eight cancers. 
     The ACS estimates that liver cancer will be diagnosed in 42,000 Americans and cause 32,000 deaths in 2019, three-fourths of which will be hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”). Incidence and mortality rates are both increasing at approximately 3 percent per year. People who have been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver or Hepatitis B are at high risk of developing HCC. Evidence shows that HCC testing in these high-risk groups leads to earlier detection and improved outcomes. The NCCN and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (“AASLD”) guidelines recommend that these two groups be tested for HCC every six months using ultrasound and the blood-based biomarker alpha-fetoprotein (“AFP”). However, ultrasound and AFP are documented to have poor sensitivity for early stage cancer, which is the primary target of testing. We are currently seeking to develop a blood-based biomarker test to serve as an alternative to ultrasound and AFP for use in HCC testing, and our goal is to develop a patient-friendly test that performs better than this current standard of care.  We are currently enrolling a case control study of at least 1,500 patients to finalize the development of our liver cancer test.
     The ACS estimates that, in the U.S. in 2019, lung cancer will be diagnosed in 228,000 people and cause 143,000 deaths. Currently, more than half of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, after symptoms appear, when the five-year survival rate is in the low single digits. We are currently seeking to develop a blood-based biomarker test to aid in the early detection of lung cancer in individuals with lung nodules discovered through a computerized tomography (“CT”)

or other scan. Such a test may help reduce the number of follow-up procedures, and thereby reduce costs and improve health outcomes.
 Research and Development
 Research and development costs account for a material portion of our operating expenses. As we seek to enhance Cologuard and expand our product pipeline by developing additional cancer screening and diagnostic tests, we expect that our research and development expenditures will continue to increase. Competition 
 The U.S. market for colorectal cancer and pre-cancer screening is large, consisting of more than 85 million individuals between the ages of 50 and 85. If the screening population includes 45-49 year olds, as recommended by the ACS, the colorectal cancer screening market would increase by approximately 19 million people to approximately 104 million people. Given the large market for colorectal cancer screening, we face numerous competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than us. Our Cologuard test faces competition from procedure‑based detection technologies such as colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and “virtual” colonoscopy, a radiological imaging approach that visualizes the inside of the bowel by CT scan (spiral computerized axial tomography), as well as other common screening tests, such as the fecal occult blood test (“FOBT”) and the fecal immunochemical test (“FIT”), and newer screening technologies such as pill-based imaging solutions like PillCam COLON, cleared by the FDA in February 2014, and C-Scan, which obtained a CE Mark in early 2019. Our competitors may also be developing additional methods of detecting colorectal cancer and pre-cancer that have not yet been announced.
    
In addition, some companies and institutions are developing liquid biopsy tests based on the detection of proteins, tumor cells, nucleic acids, epigenetic markers, or other biomarkers in the blood. These tests could represent significant competition for Cologuard and other tests we may develop. We are aware of at least 13 companies—Epigenomics AG, EDP Biotech Corporation, Freenome Inc., GRAIL, Inc., CellMax, Inc., Volition Diagnostics, Cambridge Epigenetix Limited, Nucleix Ltd., Singlera Genomics, DiaCarta, Genomictree, Bioprognos, and PapGene, Inc. — that have developed, or are developing, liquid biopsy tests for the detection of colorectal cancer. Epigenomics AG received FDA approval for its liquid biopsy screening test for colorectal cancer, Epi proColon, in April 2016, and began offering the test commercially in May 2016. We also are aware of at least two companies, DiaTech and Geneoscopy, that have launched outside the U.S., or are seeking to develop, stool-based colorectal cancer tests based on the detection of nucleic acids. 
     We believe other companies are also working on liquid biopsy tests using next‑generation sequencing or other technologies, and these tests could represent significant competition for Cologuard and other tests we may develop. 
     Notwithstanding that the market for colorectal cancer screening is highly competitive, we believe that Cologuard, as the first and only sDNA-based non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test on the market today, compares favorably to other available products and services. All other colorectal cancer detection methods in use today are constrained by some combination of poor sensitivity, poor compliance, and high cost. For example, colonoscopy requires advance dietary restrictions and bowel cleansing and can be uncomfortable, time‑consuming, hazardous, and expensive. Colonoscopy requires sedation, potential lost time from work, and someone to drive the patient home from the procedure. A 2010 study shows that seven out of 10 people age 50 and older who were told they should get a colonoscopy did not do so primarily due to fears. Fecal blood testing, including FIT testing, suffers from poor sensitivity, with only a 74 percent detection rate for cancer and 24 percent detection rate for pre‑cancers. The blood‑based DNA tests currently available are also disadvantaged by relatively low sensitivity. Epigenomics AG has reported that the Epi proColon test has an overall cancer sensitivity rate of 68 percent, and only 59 percent for early-stage cancer. Additionally, FIT testing suffers from low adherence over time. One study published in the American Journal of Managed Care demonstrated that only three out of every 1,000 patients studied adhered to fecal test screening guidelines during a continuous 10-year observation period. 
    
Beyond our Cologuard test, as we seek to develop other tests to detect cancer and pre-cancer, we expect to compete with a broad range of organizations in the U.S. and other countries that are engaged in the development, production and commercialization of cancer screening and diagnostic products and services. These competitors include: 
    
 
  9

 


· | biotechnology, diagnostic and other life science companies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | academic and scientific institutions;
--+--------------------------------------


· | governmental agencies; and
--+---------------------------


· | public and private research organizations.
--+-------------------------------------------

 
    We may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors either because their products and services are superior or because they may have more expertise, experience, financial resources, or stronger business relationships. These competitors may have broader product lines and greater name recognition than we do. We have limited experience developing tests for detecting non-colorectal cancers and cannot guarantee that our research and development activities will be successful in developing any marketable testing products or services. Furthermore, even if we do develop new marketable products or services, our current and future competitors may develop products and services that are more commercially attractive than ours, and they may bring those products and services to market earlier or more effectively than us.
    
Seasonality
 We are in the early stages of Cologuard’s commercialization and are continuing to learn how seasonal factors may affect our business.  Based on our experience to date, we expect some seasonal variations in our financial results due to a variety of factors, such as the year-end holiday period and other major holidays, vacation patterns of both patients and physicians, climate and weather conditions in our markets, seasonal conditions that may affect medical practices and provider activity, including for example influenza outbreaks that may reduce the percentage of patients that can be seen for preventive care such as colorectal cancer screening, and other factors relating to the timing of patient deductibles and co-insurance limits. Government Regulation
 Certain of our activities are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, distribution, and export of diagnostic products. Our clinical laboratory facilities are subject to oversight by CMS pursuant to CLIA, as well as agencies in various states, including New York.  We are subject to many other federal and state laws, including anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickback and patient privacy. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can lead to sanctions, including withdrawal of products from the market, recalls, refusal to authorize government contracts, product seizures, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, civil money penalties, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration
 The FDA granted premarket approval (“PMA”) for Cologuard in August 2014.  Devices subject to FDA regulation must undergo premarket review prior to commercialization unless the device is exempt from such review. The regulations governing Cologuard’s approval place substantial restrictions on how Cologuard is marketed and sold, specifically, by prescription only. In addition, as a condition of our FDA approval, we are required to conduct a post-approval study. A final report on this study is due to FDA in 2020. There can be no assurance that the results of this study will be satisfactory and will not cause the FDA to modify or withdraw our approval for Cologuard.
 Additionally, manufacturers of medical devices must comply with various regulatory requirements under the FDCA and regulations thereunder, including, but not limited to, quality system regulations, unless they are exempt, facility registration, product listing, labeling requirements, and certain post-market surveillance requirements. Entities that fail to comply with FDA requirements can be liable for criminal or civil penalties, such as recalls, detentions, orders to cease manufacturing, and restrictions on labeling and promotion, among other potential sanctions. In 2017, we recalled one of the components of our Cologuard test kit and circumstances may arise that cause us to recall other products or components used in connection with our Cologuard test.
 We may develop new diagnostic products and services that are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The regulatory review and approval process for medical devices can be costly, timely, and uncertain. This process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical trials and submitting a premarket clearance notice or filing a premarket approval application with the FDA. If premarket review is required by the FDA, there can be no assurance that our tests will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, there can be no assurance 

 
  10

 
that the labeling claims cleared or approved by the FDA will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our products. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations could increase the cost of conducting our business, subject us to FDA inspections and other regulatory actions, and potentially subject us to penalties in the event we fail to comply with such requirements.
 We may also develop diagnostic products or services that, under today’s laws, would be regulated as laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”) under CLIA.  However, as noted below, the regulation of LDTs may be in flux, as the FDA retracted a proposal for increased LDT oversight in January 2017 and continues to apply enforcement discretion.
 Laboratory Developed Tests (“LDTs”)
     LDTs are clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use.  Historically, LDTs have been regulated under CLIA while the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion and not required approvals or clearances for many LDTs performed by CLIA-certified laboratories. The FDA has traditionally chosen not to exercise its authority to regulate LDTs because LDTs were limited in number, were relatively simple tests, and were typically used to diagnose rare disease and uncommon conditions. 
 In October 2014, the FDA published two draft guidance documents describing a proposed risk-based framework under which the FDA might regulate LDTs. The FDA’s draft framework proposed, among other things, premarket review for higher-risk LDTs, such as those that have the same intended use as FDA-approved or cleared diagnostics currently on the market. In November 2015, the FDA issued a report citing evidence for the need for additional regulation of LDTs and stated the FDA is continuing to work to finalize premarket review requirements for LDTs. However, in November 2016 the FDA announced it would not issue a final guidance for LDTs. In January 2017, the FDA issued a Discussion Paper on LDTs, which confirmed it would not finalize its guidance on the regulation of LDTs to allow more time for public discussion and time for the congressional authorizing committees to develop a legislative solution. It is unclear at this time if or when the FDA end enforcement discretion for LDTs. It is also unclear whether the FDA may decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time. Action by the FDA to exercise enforcement discretion over LDTs, may materially impact our development and commercialization of LDTs.
 Laboratory Certification, Accreditation and Licensing

We are also subject to U.S. and state laws and regulations regarding the operation of clinical laboratories. CLIA requirements and laws of certain states, including those of California, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Florida, impose certification requirements for clinical laboratories, and establish standards for quality assurance and quality control, among other things. CLIA provides that a state may adopt different or more stringent regulations than federal law and permits states to apply for exemption from CLIA if the state’s laboratory laws are equivalent to, or more stringent than, CLIA. For example, the State of New York’s clinical laboratory regulations, which have received an exemption from CLIA, contain provisions that are in certain respects more stringent than federal law. Therefore, as long as New York maintains a licensure program that is CLIA-exempt, we will need to comply with New York’s clinical laboratory regulations in order to offer our clinical laboratory products and services in New York.
 We have current certificates to perform clinical laboratory testing. Clinical laboratories are subject to inspection by regulators and to sanctions for failing to comply with applicable requirements. Sanctions available under CLIA and certain state laws include prohibiting a laboratory from running tests, requiring a laboratory to implement a corrective plan, and imposing civil monetary penalties. If we fail to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or state law, that failure could adversely affect any future CMS consideration of our technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense.
  HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HIPAA”) established comprehensive protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or “Covered Entities”: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Covered Entities and their business associates must have in place administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. We perform activities that may implicate HIPAA, such as providing clinical laboratory testing services and entering into specific kinds of relationships with 

 
  11

 
Covered Entities and business associates of Covered Entities. Penalties for violations of HIPAA include civil money and criminal penalties.
 Our activities must also comply with other applicable privacy laws, which impose restrictions on the access, use and disclosure of personal information. More state and international privacy laws are being adopted. Many state laws are not preempted by HIPAA because they are more stringent or are broader in scope than HIPAA. Beginning in 2020 we will also need to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which protects personal information other than health information covered by HIPAA. In the E.U., the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in May 2018 and imposes increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules. All of these laws may impact our business and may change periodically, which could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially costlier than under current requirements. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain stool, blood and other patient samples and associated patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
  Federal and State Billing and Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Antifraud Laws/Overpayments. We are subject to numerous federal and state antifraud and abuse laws, including the Federal False Claims Act. Many of these antifraud laws are broad in scope, and neither the courts nor government agencies have extensively interpreted these laws. Prohibitions under some of these laws include:
· | the submission of false claims or false information to government programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the retention of any overpayments by governmental payers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | deceptive or fraudulent conduct;
--+---------------------------------


· | excessive or unnecessary services or services at excessive prices; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | defrauding private sector health insurers.
--+-------------------------------------------

  We may be subject to substantial penalties for violations of anti-fraud and abuse laws, including denial of payment and refunds or recoupments, suspension of payments from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs, and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, as well as civil monetary and criminal penalties and imprisonment. Numerous federal and state agencies enforce the antifraud and abuse laws. In addition, private insurers may also bring private actions. In some circumstances, private whistleblowers are authorized to bring fraud suits on behalf of the government against providers and are entitled to receive a portion of any final recovery.
 In addition, amendments to the False Claims Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from governmental payers. Within 60 days of identifying and quantifying an overpayment, a provider is required to notify CMS or the Medicare contractor of the overpayment and the reason for it and return the overpayment. These amendments could subject our procedures for identifying and processing payments to greater scrutiny.  Overpayments may occur from time to time in the healthcare industry without any fraudulent intent. For example, overpayments may result from mistakes in reimbursement claim forms or from improper processing by governmental payers. We maintain protocols intended to identify any overpayments. From time to time we may identify overpayments and be required to refund those amounts to government payers. 
 To avoid liability, we must carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, proactively monitor the accuracy and appropriateness of Medicare claims and payments received, diligently investigate any credible information indicating that we may have received an overpayment, and promptly return any overpayments.
 Federal and State “Self‑Referral” and “Anti-Kickback” Restrictions
 If we or our operations are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations prohibiting improper referrals for healthcare services or products, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Anti‑Kickback Statute. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, unless an exception applies. The term “remuneration” 

 
  12

 
is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Sanctions for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may include imprisonment and other criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors.
 Self‑Referral Law. The federal “self‑referral” law, commonly referred to as the “Stark” law, provides that physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with a laboratory are prohibited from making a referral to that laboratory for laboratory tests reimbursable by Medicare, and also prohibits laboratories from submitting a claim for Medicare payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with the testing laboratory. The Stark law contains a number of specific exceptions which, if met, permit physicians who have ownership or compensation arrangements with a testing laboratory to make referrals to that laboratory and permit the laboratory to submit claims for Medicare payments for laboratory tests performed pursuant to such referrals. We are subject to comparable state laws, some of which apply to all payers regardless of source of payment, and do not contain identical exceptions to the Stark law.
 Any action against us for violation of these or similar foreign laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. 
 Sunshine Act
 In 2010, Congress enacted a statute commonly known as the Sunshine Act, which aims to promote transparency. The Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, to report annually to CMS any payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, unless an exception applies. Manufacturers must also disclose to CMS any physician ownership or investment interests. Some states have similar transparency laws. Our failure to comply with any applicable transparency reporting requirements may subject us to substantial penalties.  Other Laws
 Occupational Safety and Health. In addition to its comprehensive regulation of health and safety in the workplace in general, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements aimed specifically at laboratories and other healthcare‑related facilities. In addition, because our operations require employees to use certain hazardous chemicals, we also must comply with regulations on hazard communication and hazardous chemicals in laboratories. These regulations require us, among other things, to develop written programs and plans, which must address methods for preventing and mitigating employee exposure, the use of personal protective equipment, and training.
 Specimen Transportation. Our commercialization activities for Cologuard subject us to regulations of the Department of Transportation, the United States Postal Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens.
 Environmental. The cost of compliance with federal, state and local provisions related to the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our business.  There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the year ended December 31, 2018, and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes for the year ended December 31, 2019.
 Intellectual Property
 We have intellectual property rights pertaining to sample type, sample preparation, sample preservation, biomarkers, and related methods and formulations.

 Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect our technologies through patent coverage. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 43 issued patents and 42 pending patent applications in the United States, and 87 issued patents and 67 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. 
 As further described in the “License Agreements” section below, we acquired certain patents related to Cologuard from MDxHealth (“MDx”) on April 25, 2017 as part of a royalty buy-out agreement and patent purchase agreement. 

In December 2017, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Armune Purchase Agreement”) with Armune BioScience, Inc. (“Armune”), pursuant to which we acquired intellectual property and certain other assets underlying Armune’s APIFINY®, APIFINY® PRO and APIFINY® ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE prostate cancer diagnostic tests. The portfolio of Armune assets we acquired is expected to complement our product pipeline. The total consideration was comprised of an up-front cash payment of $12.0 million and $17.5 million in contingent payment obligations that will become payable upon our achievement of development and commercial milestones using the acquired intellectual property.  In connection with the Armune Purchase Agreement, Armune terminated a license agreement pursuant to which it licensed certain patent rights and know-how from the Regents of the University of Michigan (“University of Michigan”), and we entered into a license agreement with the University of Michigan with respect to such patent rights and know-how, as well as certain additional intellectual property rights. Pursuant to our agreement with the University of Michigan, we are required to pay the University of Michigan a low single-digit royalty on our net sales of products using the licensed intellectual property.
     Each of our patents generally has a term of 20 years from its respective priority filing date. Of our issued patents referenced above, the earliest is set to expire in 2020 and the last of these will expire in 2035.
 License Agreements
 We license certain technologies that are, or may be, incorporated into our technology under several license agreements. Generally, the license agreements require us to pay royalties based on certain net revenues received, and may require minimum royalty amounts, milestone payments, and maintenance fees. Mayo
 In June 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“Mayo”). Our license agreement with Mayo was amended and restated in February 2015 and further amended in January 2016, October 2017, and in December 2018. Under the license agreement, Mayo granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to certain Mayo patents and patent applications, as well as a non‑exclusive, worldwide license with regard to certain Mayo know‑how. The scope of the license covers any screening, surveillance or diagnostic tests or tools for use in connection with any type of cancer, pre-cancer, disease or condition.  
 The licensed Mayo patents and patent applications contain both method and composition claims that relate to sample processing, analytical testing, and data analysis associated with nucleic acid screening for cancers and other diseases. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S., Australia, Canada, the European Union, China, Japan, and Korea. Under the license agreement, we assumed the obligation and expense of prosecuting and maintaining the licensed Mayo patents and are obligated to make commercially reasonable efforts to bring to market products using the licensed Mayo intellectual property. 

Mayo has agreed to make available personnel through January 2020 to provide us product development and research and development assistance.
 Pursuant to our agreement with Mayo, we are required to pay Mayo a low single-digit royalty on our net sales of products using the licensed Mayo intellectual property, with minimum annual royalty fees of $25,000 each year during the term of the Mayo agreement. The January 2016 amendment to the Mayo license agreement established various low single-digit royalty rates on net sales of current and future products and clarified how net sales will be calculated.  As part of the January 2016 and October 2017 amendments, the royalty rate on our net sales of Cologuard increased, but the rate remained a low single-digit percentage of net sales. 

 
  14

 

 In addition to the royalty rates described above, we are also required to pay Mayo cash of $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $2.0 million upon each product using the licensed Mayo intellectual property reaching $5.0 million, $20.0 million and $50.0 million in cumulative net sales, respectively.
 As part of the February 2015 amendment and restatement of the license agreement, we agreed to pay Mayo an additional $5.0 million, payable in five annual installments, through 2019.
 The license agreement will remain in effect, unless earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with the agreement, until the last of the licensed patents expires in 2033 (or later, if certain licensed patent applications are issued). However, if we are still using the licensed Mayo know‑how or certain Mayo‑provided biological specimens or their derivatives on such expiration date, the term shall continue until the earlier of the date we stop using such know‑how and materials and the date that is five years after the last of the licensed patents expires. The license agreement contains customary termination provisions and permits Mayo to terminate the license agreement if we sue Mayo or its affiliates, other than any such suit claiming an uncured material breach by Mayo of the license agreement.
 Hologic
 In October 2009, we entered into a technology license agreement with Hologic, Inc. (“Hologic”). Under the license agreement, Hologic granted us an exclusive, worldwide license within the field of human stool based colorectal cancer and pre‑cancer detection or identification with regard to certain Hologic patents, patent applications and improvements, including Hologic’s Invader detection chemistry (the “Covered Hologic IP”). The licensed patents and patent applications contain both method and composition‑of‑matter claims. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, and Korea. The license agreement also provided us with non‑exclusive, worldwide licenses to the Covered Hologic IP within a field covering clinical diagnostic purposes relating to colorectal cancer (including cancer diagnosis, treatment, monitoring or staging) and the field of detection or identification of colorectal cancer and pre‑cancers through means other than human stool samples. In December 2012, we entered into an amendment to this license agreement with Hologic pursuant to which Hologic granted us a non‑exclusive worldwide license to the Covered Hologic IP within the field of any disease or condition within, related to or affecting the gastrointestinal tract and/or appended mucosal surfaces.
 We are required to pay Hologic a low single-digit royalty on our net sales of products using the Covered Hologic IP.
 Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the agreement, the license agreement will remain in effect until the last of the licensed patents expires in 2029. The agreement contains customary termination provisions which, among other things, permit termination in the event of material uncured breaches.
 MDx Health
 In July 2010, we entered into a technology license and royalty agreement (“MDx License Agreement”) with MDx Health (formerly Oncomethylome Sciences, S.A.) (“MDx”). Under the MDx License Agreement, MDx granted us a royalty bearing, exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents. Under the MDx License Agreement, we were obligated to make commercially reasonable efforts to bring products covered by the license agreement to market. We were required to pay MDx a low-single digit royalty fee, subject to an annual minimum, as well as various milestone payments. 
 Effective April 2017, we and MDx entered into a Royalty Buy-Out Agreement, which terminated the MDx License Agreement. Pursuant to the Royalty Buy-Out Agreement, we paid MDx a one-time fee of $8.0 million in exchange for an assignment of certain patents covered by the MDx License Agreement and the elimination of all ongoing royalties and other payments by us to MDx under the MDx License Agreement. Also included in the Royalty Buy-Out Agreement is a mutual release of liabilities, which includes all amounts previously accrued under the MDx License Agreement. Concurrently with entering into the Royalty Buy-Out Agreement, we entered into a Patent Purchase Agreement with MDx under which we paid MDx an additional $7.0 million in exchange for the assignment of certain other patent rights that were not covered by the MDx License Agreement.

  Acquisitions
     In October 2018, we completed the acquisition of Biomatrica, Inc. (“Biomatrica”), a privately held company specializing in the collection and preservation of biological materials. In the acquisition, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million net of cash received, debt repaid and certain other adjustments. Contingent consideration for up to an additional $20.0 million could be earned based upon certain revenue milestones being met.  Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,977 full‑time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees generally to be good. Financial Information
