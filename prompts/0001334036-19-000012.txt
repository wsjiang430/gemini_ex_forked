ITEM 1. Business
The Company
Crocs, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively the “Company,” “Crocs,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) are engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the world leader in innovative casual footwear for women, men, and children, combining comfort and style with a value that consumers want. The vast majority of shoes within Crocs’ collection contain Croslite™ material, a proprietary, molded footwear technology, delivering extraordinary comfort with each step. The Company, a Delaware corporation, is the successor to a Colorado corporation of the same name, and was originally organized in 1999 as a limited liability company. 
Products
Since we first introduced a single-style clog in six colors in 2002, we have grown to be a world leader of innovative, casual footwear for men, women and children. Recognized globally for our unmistakable iconic clog silhouette, we have taken the successful formula of a simple design aesthetic, paired it with modern comfort, and expanded into a wide variety of casual footwear products including sandals, flips and slides, which we collectively refer to as sandals, shoes, and boots that meet the needs of the whole family. In 2018, Crocs reinforced its mission of “everyone comfortable in their own shoes” with the second year of its global Come As You Are™ campaign.
Crocs offers a broad portfolio of all-season products, while remaining true to its core molded footwear heritage. The vast majority of Crocs™ shoes feature Croslite™ material, a proprietary, revolutionary technology that gives each pair of shoes the soft, comfortable, lightweight, non-marking and odor-resistant qualities that Crocs fans know and love. Since sales began in 2002, Crocs has sold more than 630 million pairs of shoes in more than 90 countries.
At the heart of our brand’s DNA are our clogs and sandals. The Classic Clog and Crocband, our most iconic silhouette for adults and children, embody our innovation in molding, simplicity of design, and all-day comfort. The unique look and feel of the Classic clog can be experienced throughout the vast majority of our product line due to the use and design of CrosliteTM. Sandals are a natural extension of our brand, leveraging our signature molding technology to provide casual, comfortable footwear for a variety of wearing occasions.
We are now using CrosliteTM with two new technologies in our LiteRideTM and RevivaTM  collections, as we focus on visible comfort technology. LiteRideTM features comfort focused, proprietary foam insoles which are soft, lightweight and resilient, and our newest collection, RevivaTM, features a footbed with built-in air bubbles providing bounce and a massage effect.
We strive to provide our global consumers with comfortable, casual, colorful, and innovative footwear styles, with a focus on molded product. Our collections address many wearing occasions and meet the needs of the entire family. We enjoy licensing partnerships with Disney, Marvel, Nickelodeon, and Warner Bros., among others, which allow us to bring popular global franchises and characters to life on our product in a fun, exciting way.
Sales and Marketing
We run our business across three geographic regions: the Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), which are discussed in more detail in “Business Segments and Geographic Information” below. We prioritize five core markets including: (i) the U.S., (ii) Japan, (iii) China, (iv) South Korea and (v) Germany. These countries represent key geographies where we believe the greatest opportunities for growth exist. We are also concentrating our marketing efforts on these countries, in an effort to increase customer awareness of both our brand and our full product range. 
Each season we focus on presenting a compelling brand story and experience for our new product introductions as well as our on-going core products. We employ social and digital marketing centered on showcasing our clog and sandal silhouettes. We are growing our clog silhouette with new colors, graphics, licensed images, embellishments, and accessories that allow for personalization. We are expanding our sandal offerings as we pursue a greater share of a large market, with no clear global leader. We are investing in designer and celebrity collaborations and celebrity brand ambassadors to raise consumer engagement with our brand. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, total marketing costs, inclusive of advertising, production, promotional, and agency expenses, including variable marketing expenses, were $68.6 million, $59.1 million, and $56.0 million, respectively.

Distribution Channels
The broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products in more than 90 countries through three distribution channels: wholesale, retail, and e-commerce. Our wholesale channel includes domestic and international multi-brand retailers, e-tailers, and distributors; our retail channel consists of company-operated stores; and our e-commerce channel includes company-operated e-commerce sites and third-party marketplaces.
Wholesale Channel
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, 53.1%, 52.4%, and 52.7% of revenues, respectively, were derived through our wholesale channel. Our wholesale channel is made up of e-tailers, distributors, and traditional brick-and-mortar accounts, e-commerce sites operated by wholesalers, and in certain countries, also includes partner store operators. Brick-and-mortar customers typically include family footwear retailers, national and regional retail chains, sporting goods stores, and independent footwear retailers.
Outside the U.S., we use distributors when we believe such arrangements are preferable to direct sales. Distributors purchase products pursuant to a price list and are granted the right to resell those products in a defined territory, usually a country or group of countries. Our typical distribution agreements have terms of one to five years and can be terminated or renegotiated if minimum requirements are not met. No single wholesale customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues for any of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
Retail Channel
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, 30.1%, 33.0%, and 34.7%, respectively, of our revenues were derived through our retail channel. We operate through three platforms: company-operated full-price retail and outlet stores, kiosks, and store-in-store locations. With the worldwide consumer shift toward e-commerce, we are carefully managing our retail fleet, especially full-priced retail stores, and focusing on enhancing the profitability of this channel. In the third quarter of 2018, we completed the store reduction program announced in early 2017 and ended 2018 with 383 company-operated stores, down from 558 at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed 68 and opened 4 company-operated stores.
Full-Price Retail Stores
Our company-operated full-price retail stores allow us to effectively showcase the full extent of our product range to consumers and provide us with the opportunity to interact with those consumers directly. We believe the optimal space for our retail stores is between 1,500 and 1,800 square feet, located in high foot-traffic shopping malls or districts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed 42 and opened 1 full-price retail store. As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we operated 120, 161, and 228 full-price retail stores, respectively.
Outlet Stores
Our company-operated outlet stores allow us to sell discontinued and overstocked merchandise directly to consumers at discounted prices. We also sell full-priced products in certain of our outlet stores as well as built-for-outlet products. Outlet stores are similar in size to our full-price retail stores; however, they are generally located within outlet shopping centers. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed 23 and opened 3 outlet stores. As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we operated 195, 215, and 232 outlet stores, respectively.
Kiosk / Store-in-Store Locations
Our company-operated kiosks and store-in-store locations allow us to market specific product lines, with flexibility to tailor products to consumer preferences in shopping malls and other high foot traffic areas. With efficient use of retail space, and limited capital investment, we believe that kiosks and store-in-store locations can be effective vehicles for marketing our products in certain geographic areas. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed 3 kiosk and store-in-store locations, with no new openings. As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we operated 68, 71, and 98 kiosks and store-in-store locations, respectively.

E-commerce Channel
As of December 31, 2018, we offered our products through 13 company-operated e-commerce sites worldwide and also through third-party marketplaces. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, 16.8%, 14.6%, and 12.6%, respectively, of our revenues were derived through this channel. Our e-commerce presence facilitates increased access to our consumers and provides us with an opportunity to educate them about our products and brand. We continue to leverage increasingly sophisticated digital marketing activities to enhance the consumer experience and drive sales, thereby benefiting from the continued migration of consumers to online shopping.
Business Segments and Geographic Information
We have three reportable operating segments based on the geographic nature of our operations: Americas, Asia Pacific, and EMEA. In the third quarter of 2018, certain revenues and expenses previously reported within the Asia Pacific segment were shifted to the EMEA segment. The previously reported amounts for these segments and channels have been revised for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 to conform to the current period presentation. Other businesses aggregates insignificant operating segments, including company-operated manufacturing facilities located in Mexico and Italy, which ceased operations in 2018.
Americas
The Americas segment consists of revenues and expenses related to product sales in North and South America. Americas wholesale channel customers consist of a broad range of family footwear and sporting goods stores, e-tailers, and independent retailers and distributors. The Americas retail channel sells directly to consumers through 168 company-operated retail stores and Americas e-

commerce channel sales are generated through company-operated e-commerce sites. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, revenues from the Americas segment were 47.8%, 46.9%, and 45.1% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. Revenues from the U.S. were 40.7%, 38.0%, and 37.1% of our consolidated revenues, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
Asia Pacific
The Asia Pacific segment consists of revenues and expenses related to product sales throughout Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Asia Pacific wholesale channel customers consist of a broad range of retailers similar to those in the Americas, plus distributors in select markets. We also sell products directly to consumers through 153 company-operated retail stores as well as through company-operated e-commerce sites and third-party marketplaces. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, revenues from our Asia Pacific segment were 31.7%, 32.8%, and 34.2% of our consolidated revenues, respectively.
Europe, Middle East, and Africa
The EMEA segment consists of revenues and expenses related to product sales throughout Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Africa. The EMEA segment wholesale channel customers consist of a broad range of retailers, similar to those in the Americas, plus distributors in select markets. We also sell our products directly to consumers through 62 company-operated retail stores as well as through our e-commerce sites. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, revenues from our EMEA segment were 20.2%, 20.2%, and 20.6% of our consolidated revenues, respectively.
Raw Materials
CrosliteTM, our proprietary closed-cell resin brand, is the primary material formulation used in the vast majority of our footwear and some of our accessories. CrosliteTM is formulated to create soft, comfortable, lightweight, non-marking, and odor-resistant footwear. We continue to invest in research and development to refine our materials to enhance these properties and develop new properties for specific applications.
CrosliteTM is produced by compounding elastomer resins purchased from major chemical manufacturers, together with certain other production inputs such as color dyes. Multiple suppliers produce the elastomer resins used in CrosliteTM. In the future, we may identify and utilize materials produced by other suppliers as an alternative to, or in addition to, those elastomer resins. All of the other raw materials that we use to produce CrosliteTM products are readily available for purchase from multiple suppliers.
Some of the products we offer are constructed using leather, textile fabrics, or other non-CrosliteTM materials, such as LiteRideTM. These materials are obtained from a number of third-party sources and we believe these materials are also broadly available.
Sourcing
Our strategy is to maintain a flexible, globally-diversified, low-cost third-party manufacturing capability. Our company-operated production facilities in Mexico and Italy, which had produced less than 15% of our products during each of the past three years, ceased operations in 2018.
We source the remaining footwear production from multiple third-party manufacturers, primarily in Vietnam and China. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our largest third-party manufacturer, operating in both Vietnam and China, produced 44.5%, 41.3%, and 43.2%, respectively, and our second largest third-party manufacturer, operating in Vietnam, produced 21.4%, 19.0%, and 11.5%, respectively, of our footwear unit volume. We believe that the manufacturing capabilities required to produce our footwear are broadly available.
Distribution and Logistics
We strive to enhance our distribution and logistics network to further streamline our supply chain, increase our speed to market, and lower operating costs. As of December 31, 2018, we stored our finished goods inventory in company-operated warehouse and distribution and logistics facilities located in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Japan. We also utilized third-party operated distribution centers located in China, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Korea, Singapore, India, Russia, and Brazil. As of December 31, 2018, our company-operated warehouse and distribution facilities provided us with 0.7 million square feet, and our third-party operated distribution facilities provided us with 0.2 million square feet. We also ship directly to certain of our wholesale customers from our third-party manufacturers.

Intellectual Property and Trademarks
We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, trade dress, and patent protections to establish, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights in our product designs, brands, materials, and research and development efforts, although no such methods can afford complete protection. We own or license the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution, and sale of all of our products, both domestically and internationally, in most countries where our products are currently either sold or manufactured. Our major trademarks include the Crocs logo and the Crocs word mark, both of which are registered or pending registration in the U.S., the European Union, Japan, Taiwan, China, and Canada, among other countries. We also have registrations or pending trademark applications for other marks and logos in various countries around the world.
In the U.S., our patents are generally in effect for up to 20 years from the date of filing the patent application. Our trademarks registered within and outside of the U.S. are generally valid as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic. We believe our trademarks and patents are crucial to the successful marketing and sale of our products. We strategically register, both domestically and internationally, the trademarks and patents covering the product designs and branding that we utilize today. We aggressively police our patents, trademarks, and copyrights and pursue those who infringe upon them, both domestically and internationally, as we deem necessary.
We consider the formulations of the materials used to produce our footwear covered by our trademark CrosliteTM, LiteRideTM, and RevivaTM valuable trade secrets. The material formulations are manufactured through a process that combines a number of components in various proportions to achieve the properties for which our products are known. We use multiple suppliers to source these components but protect the formulations by using exclusive supply agreements for key components, confidentiality agreements with our third-party processors, and by requiring our employees to execute confidentiality agreements concerning the protection of our confidential information. Other than our third-party processors, we are unaware of any third party using our formulations in the production of footwear. We believe the comfort and utility of our products depend on the properties achieved from the compounding of CrosliteTM and LiteRideTM, which constitutes a key competitive advantage for us, and we intend to continue to vigorously protect this trade secret.
We also actively combat counterfeiting by monitoring of the global marketplace. We use our employees, sales representatives, distributors, and retailers, as well as outside investigators, attorneys and customs agents, to police against infringing products by encouraging them to notify us of any suspect products and to assist law enforcement agencies. Our sales representatives and distributors are also educated on our patents, pending patents, trademarks, and trade dress to assist in preventing potentially infringing products from obtaining retail shelf space. The laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as do the laws of the U.S., and, therefore, we may have difficulty obtaining legal protection for our intellectual property in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Seasonality
Due to the seasonal nature of our footwear, which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warm weather, revenues generated during our fourth quarter are typically less than revenues generated during our first three quarters, when the northern hemisphere is experiencing warmer weather. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, but not limited to, the timing of new model introductions, general economic conditions, and consumer confidence. Accordingly, results of operations and cash flows for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for any other quarter or for any other year.
Backlog 
A significant portion of orders from our wholesale customers and distributors remain unfilled as of any given date and, at that point, represent orders scheduled to be shipped at a future date. We refer to these unfilled orders as backlog, which can be canceled by our customers at any time prior to shipment. Backlog only relates to wholesale and distributor orders for the next season and current season fill-in orders, and excludes potential sales in our retail and e-commerce channels. Backlog as of a particular date is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, manufacturing schedules and the timing of product shipments. Backlog also is affected by the timing of customers' orders and product availability. Due to these factors and business model differences around the globe, and because backlog is cancelable at any time prior to shipment, we believe backlog is an imprecise indicator of future revenues that may be achieved in a fiscal period and cannot be relied upon.
Competition
The global casual, athletic, and fashion footwear markets are highly competitive. Although we do not believe that we compete directly with any single company with respect to the entire spectrum of our products, we believe portions of our wholesale, retail, 
6

and e-commerce businesses compete with companies including, but not limited to: NIKE Inc., adidas AG, Under Armour, Inc., Deckers Outdoor Corporation, Skechers USA, Inc., Steve Madden, Ltd., Wolverine World Wide, Inc. and VF Corporation. Our company-operated retail locations and e-commerce sites also compete with footwear retailers such as Genesco, Inc., Macy’s Inc., Dillard’s, Inc., Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc., The Finish Line Inc., and Foot Locker, Inc.
The principal elements of competition in these markets include brand awareness, product functionality, design, comfort, quality, price, customer service, and marketing and distribution. We believe that our unique footwear designs, our CrosliteTM material, our prices, our product line, and our distribution network position us well in the marketplace. However, a number of companies in the casual footwear industry have greater financial resources, more comprehensive product lines, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with wholesalers, longer operating histories, greater distribution capabilities, stronger brand recognition, and greater marketing resources than we have.

Effects of Changes in Exchange Rates on Translated Results of International Subsidiaries
As a global company, we have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We are exposed to the risk of gains and losses resulting from changes in international currency exchange rates (“exchange rates”) on monetary assets and liabilities within our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. Likewise, our U.S. companies are also exposed to the risk of gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar.
We have experienced, and will continue to experience, changes in exchange rates, impacting both our statements of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell various foreign currencies to selectively protect against volatility in the value of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than that of our subsidiaries. Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings in the period that they occur.
Changes in exchange rates have a direct effect on our reported U.S. Dollar consolidated financial statements because we translate the statements of operations and financial position of our international subsidiaries to U.S. Dollars using current period exchange rates. As a result, comparisons of reported results between reporting periods may be impacted significantly due to changes in the exchange rates used to translate the operating results of our international subsidiaries. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates on our U.S. Dollar consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,901 full-time, part-time, and seasonal employees, of which 2,577 were engaged in retail-related functions.
