Background
 
 Empire Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in the State of Utah in August 1983 under the name Chambers Energy Corporation and domesticated in Delaware in March 1985 under the name Americomm Corporation.  The name was changed to Americomm Resources Corporation in July 1995.  On May 29, 2001, Americomm Resources Corporation acquired Empire Petroleum Corporation, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Americomm Resources Corporation.  On August 15, 2001, Americomm Resources Corporation and Empire Petroleum Corporation merged and the resulting entity's name was changed to Empire Petroleum Corporation. Empire Petroleum Corporation  has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Empire Louisiana LLC ("Empire Louisiana") and Empire North Dakota LLC ("Empire North Dakota"). The consolidated financial statements of Empire Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries ("Empire", the "Company", "we") include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Business and Properties
 
On August 28, 2018, the Company purchased oil producing properties from Cardinal Exploration and Production Company ("Cardinal") for a purchase price of $323,000.  The effective date of the transaction was June 1, 2018.  After certain adjustments related to the effective date, the total proceeds paid to Cardinal were $293,966.  Such proceeds were paid from sales of unregistered securities of the Company. The oil and gas properties purchased from Cardinal include four active operated wells in Louisiana, including one saltwater disposal well.  Empire's working interests in the wells are 100%.
 
On September 20, 2018, the Company purchased oil and natural gas properties from Exodus Energy, Inc. ("Exodus") for a purchase price of $969,042. Post close adjustments reduced the purchase price to $959,338. The effective date of the transaction was August 1, 2018.  Such proceeds were paid from loan proceeds and sales of unregistered securities. The oil and gas properties include 1,500 gross developed and undeveloped acres and eight wells. The Company's working interests in the wells range from 50% to 90%.
 
On October 29, 2018, the Company purchased oil and natural gas properties from Riviera Upstream, LLC formerly known as Linn Energy Holdings, LLC ("Riviera") for a purchase price of $205,000. Post close adjustments reduced the total purchase price to $162,273.  The effective date of the transaction was October 1, 2018.  The oil and natural gas properties purchased include non-operated working interest in four producing wells and two salt water disposal wells in which the Company already owned an operated interest.
 
All of the Company's producing properties are located in Louisiana and, as of December 31, 2018, such properties were producing approximately 100 net barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day.
 
Marketing Arrangements
 
We market our oil and natural gas in accordance with standard energy industry practices. The marketing effort endeavors to obtain the combined highest netback and most secure market available at that time.
 
We sell production at the lease locations to third-party purchasers via truck transport. We do not transport, refine or process the oil we produce. We sell our produced oil under contracts using market-based pricing, which is adjusted for differentials based upon oil quality.
 
We sell our natural gas under natural gas purchase contracts using market-based pricing, which is sold at the lease location.
 
Principal Customers
 
We sell our oil and natural gas production to marketers which is transported by truck to storage facilities arranged by the marketers. Our marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted.
 
For 2018, revenues from oil and natural gas sales to Katrina Energy, LLC and Cokinos Natural Gas Company respectively, accounted for all of our total operating revenues. While the loss of  these purchasers may result in a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our production, we believe that the loss of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations, as there are alternative purchasers in our producing region.

Competition
 
The oil and natural gas industry in the areas in which we operate is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from numerous parties, ranging generally from small independent producers to major integrated companies. We primarily encounter significant competition in acquiring properties. At higher commodity prices, we also face competition in contracting for drilling, pressure pumping and workover equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial, technical and personnel resources substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable properties, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit.
 
In addition to competition for drilling, pressure pumping and workover equipment, we are also affected by the availability of related equipment and materials. The oil and natural gas industry periodically experiences shortages of drilling and workover rigs, equipment, pipe, materials and personnel, which can delay drilling, workover and exploration activities and cause significant price increases. We are unable to predict the timing or duration of any such shortages.
 
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
 
The estimates of our proved reserves at December 31, 2018, all of which were located in the United States, were based on evaluations prepared by an independent petroleum engineering firm. Reserves were estimated in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB").
 
The following table represents the Company's oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2018.

Investment in Masterson West II
 
On December 22, 2016, the Company entered into a subscription and contribution agreement with Masterson West, LLC ("Masterson West") (the "Contribution Agreement") relating to the newly formed Masterson West II, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ("Masterson West II").   Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, among other things, (a) at the initial closing, the Company agreed to contribute 2,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), to Masterson West II, along with an additional 38,000,000 shares of Common Stock and (b) at the final closing, Masterson West had an obligation to contribute certain oil and gas properties (the "Contributed Properties") to Masterson West II in exchange for the Company contributing cash of not less than $9,000,000 and up to $18,000,000 to Masterson West II.  The final closing was scheduled to occur no later than April 1, 2017. Also on December 22, 2016, the Company entered into a limited liability agreement of Masterson West II with Masterson West (the "LLC Agreement").  On February 18, 2017, Gary C. Adams, the majority owner of Masterson West unexpectedly passed away. As a result of this development, the transactions were not consummated. On December 1, 2018, the Company and Masterson West agreed to terminate and unwind the Contribution Agreement in a manner as if the parties had never entered into the Contribution Agreement. As a result of the Termination Agreement, in 2018 the Company has reversed its $300,000 investment in Masterson West II and the related common stock subscription and paid in capital.
 
Changes in Directors and Executive Officers

Markets; Price Volatility
 
The market price of oil and gas is volatile, subject to speculative movement and depends upon numerous factors beyond the control of the Company, including expectations regarding inflation, global and regional demand, political and economic conditions and production costs. Future profitability, if any, will depend substantially upon the prevailing prices for oil and gas.  If the market price for oil and gas remains depressed in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to raise additional capital necessary to finance operations. Lower oil and gas prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas, if any, that can be produced economically from the Company's properties.  The Company anticipates that the prices of oil and gas will fluctuate in the near future.
Regulation
 
The oil and gas industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the production, transportation and sale of hydrocarbons as well as the taxation of income resulting therefrom.
 
Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is constantly changing.  Numerous federal and state departments and agencies have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry.  In general, these rules and regulations regulate, among other things, the extent to which acreage may be acquired or relinquished; spacing of wells; measures required for preventing waste of oil and gas resources; and, in some cases, rates of production.  The heavy and increasing regulatory burdens on the oil and gas industry increase the Company's cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability.
 
Many times, leases are granted by the federal government and administered by the BLM and the Minerals Management Service ("MMS") of the U.S. Department of the Interior, both of which are federal agencies.  Such leases are issued through competitive bidding, contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed BLM and MMS regulations and orders (which are subject to change by the BLM and the MMS).  Leases are also accompanied by stipulations imposing restrictions on surface use and operations.  Operations to be conducted by the Company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions, including various nondiscrimination statutes.  Federal leases also generally require a complete archaeology and environmental impact assessment prior to the authorization of an exploration or development plan.
 
The oil and gas operations are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. These laws govern, among other things, the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment, the issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling and production activities, the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites.  These laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities if the Company fails to comply or if any contamination results from the Company's operations.
 
Employees
 
The Company has one employee, the Vice President of Operations.  On November 28, 2017, Thomas Pritchard was appointed as the Company's Chief Executive Officer. Michael Morrisett serves as the Company's President.
 
On November 29, 2017, the Company issued warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.15 per share, and 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.25 per share, to Anthony Kamin as consideration for his service on the Board of Directors.  For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company paid Mr. Morrisett $156,400 and $54,700 respectively, for services rendered.  The Company paid Mr. Pritchard $156,400  and $10,000 in 2018 and 2017 respectively for services rendered as Chief Executive Officer. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017,  Mr. Pritchard's firm was paid $24,200 and $56,764 respectively, for professional services. On November 29, 2017, the Company issued warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.25 per share to each of Mr. Pritchard and Mr. Morrisett for services rendered to the Company.
