Background
 
22nd Century Group, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 12, 2005 under the name Touchstone Mining Limited. On January 25, 2011, we entered into a reverse merger transaction with 22nd Century Limited, LLC, which we refer to herein as the “merger.” Upon the closing of the merger, 22nd Century Limited, LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary. After the merger, we succeeded to the business of 22nd Century Limited, LLC as our sole line of business.
 
22nd Century Limited, LLC was originally formed as a New York limited liability company on February 20, 1998 as 21st Century Limited, LLC and subsequently merged with a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company, 22nd Century Limited, LLC, on November 29, 1999. Since inception, 22nd Century Limited, LLC has sponsored research and subsequently used biotechnology to regulate the nicotine content in tobacco plants.
 
Overview
 
We are a plant biotechnology company focused on technology that allows us to increase or decrease the level of nicotine and other nicotinic alkaloids in tobacco plants and the levels of cannabinoids in hemp/cannabis plants through genetic engineering and plant breeding. Our primary mission in tobacco is to reduce the harm caused by smoking. Our primary mission in hemp/cannabis is to develop proprietary hemp strains for potential important new medicines and agricultural crops. We have an extensive intellectual property portfolio of issued patents and patent applications relating to the tobacco and hemp/cannabis plants.
 
In tobacco, we have developed unique and proprietary Very Low Nicotine Content (“VLNC”) tobacco that grows with at least 95% less nicotine than tobacco used in conventional cigarettes. Since 2011, we have provided more than 28 million research cigarettes containing our VLNC proprietary tobaccos for use in numerous independent clinical studies at many well-known study locations, with agencies of the United States federal government investing more than $125 million in such independent clinical studies. The results of these independent clinical studies have been published in peer-reviewed publications and demonstrate that our VLNC tobacco has been associated with reductions in smoking, nicotine exposure, and nicotine dependence, with minimal evidence of nicotine withdrawal, compensatory smoking, or serious adverse events. The results of such completed and on-going clinical studies provide independent scientific support for the public announcement on July 28, 2017 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) that the FDA plans to enact a new rule to require that all combustible cigarettes sold in the United States contain only minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine. On March 19, 2018, the FDA publicly announced its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPRM”) to solicit public comments on the FDA’s plan to enact a new nicotine reduction rule. On July 16, 2018, we publicly submitted to the FDA our formal written response to the ANPRM in which we described how (i) the FDA’s proposed new rule is supported by rigorous independent, published science, (ii) the FDA’s stated goal to render cigarettes minimally or non-addictive is immediately feasible as evidenced by our production and delivery of more than 28 million VLNC research cigarettes since the year 2011, and (iii) the FDA’s proposed new rule is exceedingly practical and urgently needed in the interests of public health.
 
Since our proprietary VLNC tobacco has been the subject of numerous completed and on-going, independent clinical studies paid for by agencies of the U.S. federal government, we are investigating the use of our VLNC tobacco in our own products that will be intended to comply with the new FDA regulations. On December 5, 2018, we submitted to the FDA a new Pre-Market Tobacco product application (“PMTA”) and on December 27, 2018, we submitted to the FDA a new Modified Risk Tobacco Product application (“MRTPA”), in each case for our BRAND A VLNC cigarettes for which we are requesting a reduced exposure marketing authorization from the FDA to market BRAND A as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product with product labeling that includes the proposed brand name of VLNTM and states that the VLNTM product has 95% less nicotine than conventional cigarettes. We are also investigating the license of the use of our VLNC tobacco by third-parties. We are further investigating potential opportunities relating to our VLNC tobacco outside of the United States.
 
In hemp, we are developing proprietary hemp strains for potential important new medicines and agricultural crops. Our current activities involve only work with legal hemp in compliance with federal and state laws. The hemp plant and the cannabis/marijuana plant are both part of the same cannabis sativa genus/species of plant, except that hemp has not more than 0.3% dry weight content of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) and is legal under the federal 2018 Farm Bill and certain state laws. The same plant, with a higher THC content, is cannabis/marijuana, which is legal under certain state laws, but which is not legal under federal law. The similarities between these plants can cause confusion. Our activities with legal hemp have sometimes been incorrectly perceived as us being involved in federally illegal cannabis/marijuana. This is not the case. We work only with legal hemp in compliance with federal and state laws.

In 2017, we announced that we had developed hemp plants with zero (-0-) amount of THC as a potential solution to one of the biggest challenges that was then facing the legal hemp industry, which was that hemp farmers were not able to obtain crop insurance to protect against the risk of their entire hemp crop being destroyed if a portion of their hemp crop grew with THC levels above the legal limit of 0.3% THC. We developed our zero-THC hemp plants in 2017 as a potential solution to that risk because our zero-THC hemp plants will not develop THC above the legal limits for hemp. However, under the new U.S. federal law known as the “2018 Farm Bill,” which was enacted on December 20, 2018 and is described in more detail herein, the hemp plant has been legalized under U.S. federal law, but with compliance still being required with all applicable state hemp laws. The 2018 Farm Bill specifically authorizes federal crop insurance programs to cover hemp, so hemp farmers no longer face the loss of their hemp crops without insurance protection. Thus, any hemp plant with zero amount of THC is still a scientifically interesting plant, but the commercial viability of any zero THC hemp plant will depend on its other agronomic qualities, such as whether it has a superior fiber content, high yields, and other agronomically desirable traits for commercial uses and/or unique cannabinoid levels for possible extraction purposes. We believe that we have many such types of superior and unique hemp plant varieties, including (i) hemp plants with other desirable agronomic traits in addition to low to no amounts of THC for the legal hemp industry and (ii) hemp plants with high levels of cannabidiol (“CBD”) and other non-THC cannabinoids for the legal medical cannabinoid markets.
 
In the United States, we are working with the University of Virginia (“UVA”) to (i) create unique industrial hemp plants with guaranteed levels of THC below the legal limits that define hemp for optimal growth in Virginia, (ii) optimize other desirable hemp plant characteristics to improve the plant’s suitability for growing in Virginia and in similar legacy tobacco regions of the United States, and (iii) utilize high-value medical cannabinoid hemp varieties and specialized cannabinoid extraction processes for use in human therapeutics. We have also obtained a license in the State of New York to research and grow hemp in response to the numerous public announcements by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo that New York State intends to become a leading grower and producer of hemp and hemp-derived products. In Canada, we have conducted sponsored research on the hemp plant with Anandia Laboratories in Vancouver, British Columbia, in compliance with Canadian regulations.

Our ability to generate meaningful revenue from our proprietary tobacco, technology, and products in the United States depends on: (i) the implementation by the FDA of regulations that require all combustible cigarettes sold in the United States to contain only minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine; (ii) obtaining FDA authorization to market our potential Modified Risk Tobacco Product, VLNTM, in the United States as a modified risk or reduced exposure product; and (iii) our ability to license our technology and/or to sell our proprietary tobacco and products in international markets. Even after we receive regulatory approvals necessary to market our products in the United States or internationally, we must still meet the challenges of successful marketing, distribution, and consumer acceptance.
 
Tobacco
 
Our primary mission in tobacco is to reduce the harm caused by smoking. The FDA publicly announced on July 28, 2017, that tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States. The website of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) states that tobacco use causes more than 480,000 deaths per year and with direct health care and lost productivity costs totaling nearly $300 billion each year in the United States. The CDC website also states that in 2015, nearly 7 in 10 (68.0%) adult cigarette smokers wanted to stop smoking and more than 5 in 10 (55.4%) adult cigarette smokers had made a quit attempt in the prior year.

Our proprietary VLNC tobacco, which grows with at least 95% less nicotine than tobacco used in conventional cigarettes, has been shown in numerous published, independent clinical studies as being associated with reductions in smoking, nicotine exposure, and nicotine dependence, with minimal evidence of nicotine withdrawal, compensatory smoking, or serious adverse events. These clinical studies, which were conducted by independent researchers and paid for by United States federal government agencies, provide a foundation of independent scientific support for recently proposed changes by the FDA in the regulatory approach in the United States to address the harm caused by smoking combustible tobacco cigarettes. We believe these changes will significantly benefit us in the future as discussed in greater detail below.
 
Our Very Low Nicotine Content Tobacco and the FDA Mandate to Require Minimally or Non-Addictive Levels of Nicotine in all Cigarettes in the United States
 
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (“Tobacco Control Act”) granted the FDA authority over the regulation of all tobacco products in the United States. While the Tobacco Control Act prohibits the FDA from banning cigarettes outright, it allows the FDA to require the reduction of nicotine or any other compound in tobacco and cigarette smoke.
 
In a June 16, 2010 press release, Dr. David Kessler, the former FDA Commissioner, recommended that “the FDA should quickly move to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes to non-addictive levels. If we reduce the level of the stimulus, we reduce the craving. It is the ultimate harm reduction strategy.” Shortly thereafter in a Washington Post newspaper article, Dr. Kessler said that the amount of nicotine in a cigarette should drop from about 10 milligrams to less than 1 milligram.
 
Since 2011, the FDA, NIDA and other federal government agencies in the United States have invested more than $125 million in independent clinical studies utilizing our proprietary tobaccos, with such studies being conducted by scientists at many well-known locations, including the Mayo Clinic, the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, the Johns Hopkins University, Duke University, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Minnesota, the University of Vermont, the University of California, and others. Since 2011, we have provided more than 28 million SPECTRUM® research cigarettes for use in these independent scientific clinical studies.
 
The results of these independent clinical studies utilizing our proprietary tobaccos have been published in peer-reviewed articles in well-respected publications. For example, the October 2015 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine (N Engl J Med 2015; 373:1340-1349) published the results of a clinical trial funded by NIDA and the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products (“CTP”) that was a double-blinded, parallel, randomized clinical trial involving 840 smokers at ten locations that was led by the Center for the Evaluation of Nicotine in Cigarettes. The authors of this article in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded that the proprietary VLNC cigarettes created and supplied by us for such study were “associated with reductions in smoking, nicotine exposure, and nicotine dependence, with minimal evidence of nicotine withdrawal, compensatory smoking, or serious adverse events.”
 
As a further example, on October 5, 2017, Dr. Dorothy Hatsukami, the Co-Director of the Center for the Evaluation of Nicotine in Cigarettes and a Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Tobacco Research Programs at the University of Minnesota, publicly announced at the 5th Annual Conference on Tobacco Regulatory Science at the Vermont Center on Behavior and Health, partial results of a newly completed Phase III clinical study of 1,250-patients from all demographics over a 20-week study period in 10 study locations across the United States that compared smokers who were assigned to (i) an immediate reduction to Very Low Nicotine Content cigarettes, (ii) a gradual reduction in reduced nicotine content cigarettes, or (iii) normal nicotine content cigarettes. Dr. Hatsukami publicly stated that the full results of this Phase III study were then in peer review prior to publication, but that the results reflect that an immediate approach to nicotine reduction is most likely to lead to less harm. Dr. Hatsukami also publicly stated that the study data indicates compensatory smoking is less likely to occur with an immediate reduction in nicotine, and that there was a greater likelihood of more rapid smoking cessation with the immediate approach to nicotine reduction. Our Company provided all the research cigarettes used in this Phase III study.
 
On September 5, 2018, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published the results of such Phase III study by Dr. Hatsukami, et al., in which this independent clinical study investigated the effects of an immediate reduction in nicotine content of cigarettes versus a gradual reduction in nicotine content of cigarettes. Dr. Hatsukami, et al., used exclusively 22nd Century’s SPECTRUM® research cigarettes to conduct this study. In this randomized, parallel, double-blind clinical study, which is the largest clinical study using VLNC cigarettes conducted to date, independent scientists assigned 1,250 participants to one of three groups: (1) smokers who were provided only with cigarettes containing VLNC tobacco with 0.4 mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco, (2) smokers who were provided with cigarettes with a gradual reduction of nicotine from 15.5 mg to 0.4 mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco, and (3) smokers who were provided with cigarettes of a conventional nicotine level with 15.5 mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco. Following two weeks of baseline study and 20 weeks of intervention, an immediate reduction in nicotine emerged as the clear winner. Compared to a gradual nicotine reduction, an immediate nicotine reduction was associated with (i) lower toxicant exposure across time; (ii) fewer cigarettes smoked per day; (iii) greater reduction in nicotine dependence; and (iv) more days in which participants smoked no cigarettes (cigarette-free days). In contrast, results from the study participants assigned to a gradual reduction in nicotine were nearly indistinguishable from the results of the study participants assigned to cigarettes with a conventional level of nicotine in the areas of dependence, number of cigarette-free days, cigarettes smoked per day, and most of the biomarkers of nicotine and tobacco smoke exposure.

In a companion article published by the University of Minnesota on September 4, 2018, Dr. Hatsukami stated that “the results of this 1,250-patient study support the benefits of rapidly reducing nicotine in all cigarettes, primarily because this approach helped smokers, who initially had no immediate intentions to quit, experience smoke-free days. This is good news because the majority of smokers want to quit smoking, but only a small percentage of smokers are successful.”
 
A list of the completed, independent clinical studies that used our proprietary VLNC tobacco can be found on our website at http://www.xxiicentury.com/published-clinical-studies/. A list of the on-going, independent clinical studies on our SPECTRUM® research cigarettes can be found on our website at http://www.xxiicentury.com/on-going-clinical-studies/. Information on our website (including links to third party websites) is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
As further background in this matter, in 2015, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) Study Group on Tobacco Product Regulation published an advisory note on a global nicotine reduction strategy of limiting the sale of cigarettes to brands with a nicotine content that is not sufficient to lead to the development and/or maintenance of addiction. The WHO report referred to such cigarettes as “reduced-nicotine” cigarettes. The WHO report stated that conventional cigarettes – even those brands that deliver low nicotine yields as measured by machine smoking under the conditions of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) – contain addicting levels of nicotine, but the nicotine yields are reduced as a result of many cigarette design features, including ventilated filters, and with the result being that users puff ISO low-nicotine-yield cigarettes more intensely (i.e. they draw larger puffs and more frequent puffs than the conditions prescribed by machines) to obtain addicting levels of nicotine. However, the WHO report found that, unlike conventional cigarettes, reduced-nicotine content cigarettes can limit the addictiveness of the product, as the very low nicotine content in the tobacco cannot deliver addicting levels of nicotine. The WHO study stated that published research shows that switching from conventional cigarettes to cigarettes with a reduced-nicotine content of 0.4 mg/g of cigarette tobacco filler does not significantly increase craving or withdrawal symptoms and does not result in compensatory smoking (such as more intense smoking or smoking more cigarettes per day). The WHO study further stated that no specific amount of nicotine has yet been identified by the WHO as the absolute threshold for addiction; however, the WHO report stated that it is likely to be equal to or possibly less than 0.4 mg/g of dry cigarette tobacco filler.
 
The WHO report cites 22nd Century’s proprietary SPECTRUM® research cigarettes as meeting such a low level of nicotine of 0.4 mg/g of cigarette tobacco filler. The WHO report concluded that the evidence indicates that setting a maximum allowable nicotine content for all cigarettes could (i) reduce the acquisition of smoking and progression to addiction, (ii) reduce the prevalence of smoking in a proportion of addicted smokers as a result of behavioral extinction, (iii) increase the rate of quitting and reduce the number of smokers who relapse, and (iv) increase the development, availability, and use of alternative forms of nicotine, e.g. smokeless tobacco products, nicotine aerosol products, and medicinal nicotine, which have potential adverse health effects, including maintenance of addiction, but less than those of combusted products or conventional cigarettes. The WHO report stated that population benefits will result from decreased use of combusted tobacco by current cigarette smokers and from the prevention of addiction of non-smokers to cigarettes, especially among young people.
 
On July 28, 2017, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., announced the FDA’s plan to exercise its authority under the Tobacco Control Act to require that all combustible cigarettes sold in the United States must contain only minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine. In that public announcement, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb stated that (i) the overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes – the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of all long-term users, (ii) unless this course is changed, 5.6 million young people alive today will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use, (iii) envisioning a world where cigarettes would no longer create or sustain addiction, and where adults who still need or want nicotine could get it from alternative and less harmful sources, needs to be the cornerstone of the FDA’s efforts, and (iv) tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, causing more than 480,000 deaths per year and direct health care and lost productivity costs totaling nearly $300 billion each year.
 
On August 16, 2017, The New England Journal of Medicine published an article by FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. and Mitchell Zeller, J.D., the Director of the FDA/CTP, entitled “A Nicotine-Focused Framework of Public Health.” In this article, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb and FDA/CTP Director Zeller stated that the Tobacco Control Act gives the FDA a regulatory tool called a tobacco “product standard” that can be used to alter the addictiveness of combustible cigarettes, and that such standards may set requirements related to an ingredient or constituent in a tobacco product, or related to any other aspect of product composition, construction, or other property, and that the establishment of the right product standard could alter the addictiveness of combustible cigarettes by setting maximum nicotine levels in such products. The article further stated that Section 907 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorizes the FDA to establish tobacco product standards that the FDA has determined to be appropriate for the protection of the public health, with the statute specifically noting that such a standard may address nicotine yields, among other characteristics. Although the statute prohibits the FDA from requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero, the FDA stated in this article that the FDA has clear authority to otherwise reduce nicotine levels. The FDA concluded in this article that a nicotine-limiting standard could make cigarettes minimally addictive or non-addictive, helping current users of combustible cigarettes to quit and allowing most future users to avoid becoming addicted and proceeding to regular use, and that disrupting that progression – from experimentation to regular use to tobacco-related disease and even death – could save millions of American lives. In this article, the FDA also stated that the FDA will consider peer-reviewed, scientific studies in proposing a maximum nicotine level, but that rigorous studies of Very Low Nicotine Content cigarettes have evaluated the potential effects of various nicotine levels on smoking behaviors and biomarkers, and findings from such studies could inform decision-making on a possible maximum nicotine level in tobacco filler. The FDA stated that, as in all matters of public health policy, the FDA will be led by the science in this important area.

In summary, since 2011, the FDA, NIDA and other federal government agencies have invested more than $125 million in independent clinical studies utilizing 22nd Century’s proprietary tobaccos, with such studies being conducted by scientists at many different and well-known clinical study centers. During that same time, we have provided more than 28 million proprietary SPECTRUM® research cigarettes for use in such independent clinical studies. The results of these studies have been published in peer-reviewed articles and reflect the independent scientific support for the planned mandate by the FDA that all combustible cigarettes sold in the United States contain only minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine. We believe that our VLNC tobacco technology and our production and delivery of more than 28 million proprietary research cigarettes since 2011 reflects that the FDA’s plan to dramatically reduce nicotine in cigarettes is technologically feasible. Since our proprietary VLNC tobacco has been the subject of numerous completed and on-going independent clinical studies, we are investigating the potential use of our VLNC tobacco in our own products that will be intended to comply with the new FDA regulations, as well as we are investigating the potential license of the use of our VLNC tobacco by third-parties. In the United States, we will focus on working with the FDA on its nicotine reduction mandate and on our Premarket Tobacco product application (“PMTA”) and our Modified Risk Tobacco Product application (“MRTPA”) that we submitted to the FDA in December 2018 for our BRAND A Very Low Nicotine Content cigarettes with product labeling that includes the proposed brand name of VLNTM and states that the VLNTM product has 95% less nicotine than conventional cigarettes. Outside the United States, we will focus on working with WHO-member countries that desire to utilize our proprietary VLNC tobacco to implement the WHO recommendation of limiting the sale of cigarettes to brands with a nicotine content that is not sufficient to lead to development and/or maintenance of addiction.


Products
 
BRAND A Very Low Nicotine Content Cigarettes

The tobacco in our BRAND A Very Low Nicotine Content cigarettes contains at least 95% less nicotine than conventional cigarette brands. The strategy behind BRAND A is to reduce smokers’ exposure to nicotine, which is the primary addictive component of cigarettes.
 
The Tobacco Control Act establishes procedures for the FDA to regulate the labeling and marketing of Modified Risk Tobacco Products, which includes cigarettes marketed to (i) reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease or (ii) reduce or eliminate exposure to a substance (“Modified Risk Cigarettes”). The Tobacco Control Act required the FDA to issue specific regulations and/or guidance regarding applications submitted to the FDA for the authorization to label and market Modified Risk Tobacco Products. On March 30, 2012, the FDA issued Modified Risk Tobacco Product Applications Draft Guidance. We believe that our BRAND A Very Low Nicotine Content cigarettes will qualify as Modified Risk Cigarettes.
 
On December 31, 2015, we submitted to the FDA a combined Premarket Tobacco product application (“PMTA”) and a Modified Risk Tobacco Product Application (“MRTPA”) requesting a reduced exposure marketing authorization from the FDA to market BRAND A as a Modified Risk Cigarette with product labeling and advertising that states that BRAND A has 95% less nicotine than conventional cigarettes. In December 2016, the FDA provided us with feedback on our combined PMTA/MRTPA for our BRAND A Very Low Nicotine Content tobacco cigarettes. In response to the FDA’s requests at that time, and in conjunction with additional clarifying guidance, we withdrew our then existing applications with the FDA in order to file a new bifurcated PMTA and MRTPA with the FDA for BRAND A that would include additional scientific data and other information requested by the FDA.
 
In support of our expanded work on our revised PMTA and MRTPA for our BRAND A Very Low Nicotine Content cigarettes, we increased the depth and experience of our scientific and regulatory team. On October 31, 2017, we hired Dr. James E. Swauger to be our new Senior Vice President of Science and Regulatory Affairs. Dr. Swauger was previously the leader of the scientific and regulatory functions at Reynolds American Inc., one of the largest tobacco companies in the United States. Dr. Swauger’s primary responsibilities with us were to lead and oversee our scientific and regulatory affairs, plant biotechnology, research and development, and external scientific activities, including the resubmission to the FDA of our PMTA and MRTPA for our BRAND A Very Low Nicotine Content cigarettes. On December 4, 2017, we also hired Dr. Juan Sanchez Tamburrino to be our new Vice President of Research and Development. Dr. Tamburrino was previously the head of the Plant Biotechnology Division of British American Tobacco, one of the largest tobacco companies in the world. Dr. Tamburrino is an integral part of our scientific and regulatory team working on our PMTA and MRTPA for our BRAND A Very Low Nicotine Content cigarettes, and our continuing research and development of improved Very Low Nicotine Content tobacco plants. On April 19, 2018, Dr. Swauger passed away suddenly. After the passing of Dr. Swauger, we continued to perform the additional work and tests to be included in our new PMTA and MRTPA.


On December 5, 2018, we submitted a new PMTA to the FDA and on December 27, 2018, we submitted a new MRTPA to the FDA, in each case for our BRAND A Very Low Nicotine Content cigarettes for which we are requesting a reduced exposure marketing authorization from the FDA to market BRAND A as a Modified Risk Cigarette with product labeling that includes the proposed brand name of VLNTM and states that BRAND A has 95% less nicotine than conventional cigarettes.

SPECTRUM® Government Research Cigarettes
 
NIDA, which is a part of NIH, provides the scientific community with controlled and uncontrolled research chemicals and drug compounds through its Drug Supply Program. In 2010, NIDA included an option to develop and produce research cigarettes with various levels of nicotine (from very low to high) in its request for proposals for a five-year contract for Preparation and Distribution of Research and Drug Products. We agreed, as a subcontractor to RTI International (“RTI”), to supply cigarettes with different nicotine contents (from very low to high) to NIDA. In August 2010, we met with officials from NIDA, FDA, RTI, CDC and the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”) to finalize certain aspects of the design of these research cigarettes. These government research cigarettes produced by us under the mark SPECTRUM® have been, and continue to be, distributed by RTI for NIDA to independent researchers for scientific clinical studies. The SPECTRUM® research cigarette contract was renewed in 2015 for an additional five years.
 
Since 2011, the FDA, NIDA and other federal government agencies have invested more than $125 million in independent clinical studies utilizing our proprietary tobaccos, with such studies being conducted at many well-known locations, including the Mayo Clinic, the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, the Johns Hopkins University, Duke University, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Minnesota, the University of Vermont, the University of California, and others. Since 2011, we have provided more than 28 million SPECTRUM® research cigarettes for use in these independent clinical studies, with the most recent shipment of 3.6 million SPECTRUM® research cigarettes occurring in November 2018. The SPECTRUM® product line consists of a series of 24 cigarette styles (11 regular and 13 menthol versions) that have 8 different levels of nicotine – from very low to high. A list of the completed, independent clinical studies on our proprietary tobaccos can be found on our website at http://www.xxiicentury.com/published-clinical-studies/. A list of the on-going, independent clinical studies on our proprietary VLNC tobacco can be found on our website at http://www.xxiicentury.com/on-going-clinical-studies/. We do not incorporate the information on our website into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
 X-22 Prescription Smoking Cessation Aid
 
X-22 is a tobacco-based botanical medical product for use as an aid to smoking cessation. Our X-22 therapy protocol calls for patients to smoke exclusively our X-22 cigarettes over a six-week treatment period to facilitate the goal of the patient quitting smoking by the end of the treatment period. We believe that X-22 cigarettes made from our proprietary VLNC tobacco satisfy smokers’ cravings for cigarettes while (i) greatly reducing nicotine exposure and nicotine dependence and (ii) extinguishing the association between the act of smoking and the rapid delivery of nicotine. X-22 involves the same smoking behavior as conventional cigarettes and, because patients are simply switching to cigarettes with a low nicotine content for 6 weeks, X-22 does not expose the smoker to any new drugs or new side effects.
 
Independent clinical studies have demonstrated that smokers who smoke cigarettes containing our proprietary VLNC tobacco smoke fewer cigarettes per day resulting in significant reductions in smoke exposure, including “tar,” nicotine, and carbon monoxide. Due to the very low nicotine levels, compensatory smoking does not occur with cigarettes containing our proprietary VLNC tobacco. A list of the completed, independent clinical studies that used our proprietary VLNC tobacco can be found on our website at http://www.xxiicentury.com/published-clinical-studies/. We do not incorporate the information on our website into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
As a result of the FDA’s announcement on July 28, 2017 to require the reduction of nicotine to minimally or non-addictive levels in all cigarettes sold in the United States, we do not believe that there will be a market in the United States for a prescription-based product consisting of our VLNC tobacco because tobacco with minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine will be mandated by the FDA in all combustible tobacco cigarettes in the United States. Accordingly, we will continue to explore opportunities outside of the United States for X-22 in markets where a prescription-based, smoking cessation product may be appropriate.


BRAND B Low-Tar-to-Nicotine Ratio Cigarettes
 
Using a proprietary high nicotine tobacco blend in conjunction with specialty cigarette components, BRAND B allows the smoker to achieve a satisfactory amount of nicotine per cigarette while inhaling less “tar” and carbon monoxide. At the same time, we do not expect exposure to nicotine from BRAND B to be significantly higher than commercially available full flavor cigarette brands. We believe smokers who desire to reduce smoke exposure, but are less concerned about nicotine, may find BRAND B beneficial.
 
In a 2001 report, entitled Clearing the Smoke, Assessing the Science Base for Tobacco Harm Reduction, the Institute of Medicine (the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences) notes that a low “tar”/moderate nicotine cigarette is a viable strategy for reducing the harm caused by smoking. The report states: “Retaining nicotine at pleasurable or addictive levels while reducing the more toxic components of tobacco is another general strategy for harm reduction.”

We had previously intended to submit a Modified Risk Tobacco Product application to the FDA for BRAND B. However, as a result of the FDA’s announcement on July 28, 2017 to require the reduction of nicotine to minimally or non-addictive levels in all cigarettes sold in the United States, we no longer believe that there will be a market in the United States for BRAND B. As such, we will continue to explore opportunities outside of the United States for BRAND B in markets where that product may be appropriate.
 
RED SUN and MAGIC Cigarettes
 
Our subsidiary, Goodrich Tobacco Company, LLC (“Goodrich Tobacco”), introduced in a limited capacity two super-premium priced cigarette brands, RED SUN and MAGIC, into the U.S. market in the first quarter 2011. From the year 2011 through the year 2014, there were de minimis sales of these brands since we intentionally did not expand the marketing and distribution of these brands until after we became a subsequent participating manufacturer under the Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”), which occurred on August 29, 2014, when the 46 Settling States under the MSA approved our acquisition of NASCO Products, LLC (“NASCO”) and NASCO became a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA. During the remainder of 2014, we worked to obtain approvals from regulatory agencies in all 50 States to have our RED SUN brand listed on the state directories of tobacco products approved for sale in each such state. During 2014, we also worked with Orion, a cigarette manufacturer in Poland, to contract manufacture our proprietary tobacco products for distribution in the European Union, starting with our MAGIC brand. In 2015, we focused our marketing efforts for RED SUN on national and regional distributors, tobacconists, smoke shops and other tobacco outlets in the United States. In 2015, we also introduced our MAGIC cigarettes to distributors and retailers in Spain. We ceased marketing the MAGIC brand in Spain when the European Union changed its packaging laws to no longer allow companies to print the nicotine yield on cigarette packs. In response to the planned mandate by the FDA that all cigarettes sold in the United States contain only minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine, we discontinued sales in the United States of our RED SUN brand as of December 31, 2017. We will continue to explore opportunities outside of the United States for our RED SUN and MAGIC brands in markets where such products may be appropriate.


Hemp
 
Our primary mission in hemp/cannabis is to develop proprietary hemp strains for potential important new medicines and agricultural crops. Our current activities involve work with only legal hemp in compliance with federal and state laws. The hemp plant and the cannabis/marijuana plant are both part of the same cannabis sativa genus/species of plant, except that hemp has not more than 0.3% dry weight content of THC and is legal under the federal 2018 Farm Bill and certain state laws. The same plant with a higher THC content is cannabis/marijuana, which is legal under certain state laws, but which is not legal under federal law. The similarities between these plants can cause confusion. Our activities with fully legal hemp have sometimes been incorrectly perceived as us being involved in federally illegal cannabis/marijuana. This is not the case. We work only with legal hemp in compliance with federal and state laws.
 
We currently sponsor hemp research in the United States at the University of Virginia (“UVA”). In December 2016, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with UVA and an exclusive license agreement with the University of Virginia Patent Foundation d/b/a University of Virginia Licensing & Ventures Group (“UVA LVG”). Over the three year term, we will invest approximately $1,000,000 in this scientific collaboration. The current goals of the research agreement include: (i) creating unique industrial hemp plants with guaranteed levels of THC below the legal limits that define hemp for optimal growth in Virginia (thus eliminating the risk to growers of having to destroy non-conforming hemp crops), (ii) optimizing other desirable hemp plant characteristics to improve the plant’s suitability for growing in Virginia and in similar legacy tobacco regions of the United States, and (iii) utilizing high-value medical cannabinoid hemp varieties and specialized cannabinoid extraction processes for use in human therapeutics.
 
On October 19, 2017, we announced that we had successfully completed our hemp field trials with UVA. The 22nd Century-UVA hemp field trials used multiple oil and fiber varieties of hemp. The Company’s hemp harvest with UVA identified proprietary varieties of hemp that we believe have excellent agronomic properties for growth in Virginia. We continued to work with UVA on our hemp plants in Virginia in 2018 and we are working with UVA on plantings in 2019 of the most promising proprietary hemp varieties to optimize plant growth in the legacy tobacco region of the United States. UVA and 22nd Century conduct all activities in this scientific collaboration within the parameters of state and federal licenses and permits held by UVA for such work. The agreements with UVA and UVA LVG grant us the exclusive rights to commercialize all results of the collaboration in consideration of royalty payments by us to UVA LVG.
 
We have also sponsored hemp research in Canada with Anandia Laboratories, Inc. (“Anandia”), a plant biotechnology company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Previously, on September 15, 2014, we were granted a sublicense by Anandia to two patents and 23 patent applications relating to genes in the hemp/cannabis plant that are required for the production of cannabinoids, the “active ingredients” in the hemp/cannabis plant, with such sublicense being exclusive in the United States and co-exclusive with Anandia everywhere else in the world, except Canada where Anandia has retained exclusive rights. The Anandia sublicense continues through the life of the last-to-expire patent, which is expected to be in 2035. Under licenses granted by the Canadian government to Anandia, we conducted research and development on unique plant varieties of hemp at Anandia, such as (i) hemp plants with low to no amounts of THC for the legal hemp industry and (ii) hemp plants with high levels of CBD and other non-THC cannabinoids for the legal medical cannabinoid markets. Anandia and 22nd Century conducted all activities in this scientific collaboration within the parameters of all applicable licenses and permits held by Anandia for such work. The agreements with Anandia grant us exclusive rights to commercialize in the United States (and co-exclusive with Anandia everywhere else in the world outside of Canada and the United States) all results of this collaboration in consideration of royalty payments by us to Anandia.

On March 23, 2017, we publicly announced that our strategic collaboration with Anandia had resulted in new industrial hemp plants that have zero (-0-) amounts of THC. We developed our zero THC hemp plants as a potential solution to one of the biggest challenges that was then facing the legal hemp industry, which was that hemp farmers were not able to obtain crop insurance to protect against the risk of their entire hemp crop being destroyed if a portion of their hemp crop grew with THC levels above the legal limit of 0.3% THC. We developed our zero THC hemp plants in 2017 as a potential solution to that risk because our zero THC hemp plants will not develop THC above the legal limits for hemp. However, under the new U.S. federal law known as the “2018 Farm Bill,” which was enacted on December 20, 2018 and is described in more detail below, the hemp plant has been legalized under U.S. federal law, but with compliance still being required with all applicable state hemp laws. The 2018 Farm Bill specifically authorizes federal crop insurance programs to cover hemp, so hemp farmers no longer face the loss of their hemp crops without insurance protection. Thus, any hemp plant with zero amount of THC is still a scientifically interesting plant, but the commercial viability of any zero THC hemp plant will depend on its other agronomic qualities, such as whether it has a superior fiber content, high yields, and other agronomically desirable traits for commercial uses and/or unique cannabinoid levels for possible extraction purposes. We have many such types of superior and unique plant varieties of hemp, including (i) hemp plants with other desirable agronomic traits in addition to low to no amounts of THC for the legal hemp industry and (ii) hemp plants with high levels of cannabidiol (“CBD”) and other non-THC cannabinoids for the legal medical cannabinoid markets.
 
We also expanded our hemp activities in our home State of New York after the many public announcements by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo that New York State (“NYS”) intends to become a leading grower and producer of hemp and hemp-derived products. On October 30, 2017, we obtained a NYS hemp research and grower license to support our expanding hemp activities in New York.


Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property enables us to decrease or increase the level of nicotine and other nicotinic alkaloids in tobacco plants and the levels of cannabinoids in hemp/cannabis plants through genetic engineering and plant breeding. The basic techniques include, but are not limited to, those that are used in the production of genetically modified (“GM”) varieties of other crops, which are also known as “biotech crops,” and the production of non-GM varieties of VLNC tobaccos.
 
We have extensive patent protection and exclusive rights covering tobacco plants with altered nicotine content produced from modifying expression of certain genes in the tobacco plant, including NBB, QPT, A622, MPO and several transcription factor genes, and tobacco products produced from these plants. A portion of the QPT patent family expired in 2018, and the remainder of the QPT patent family is expected to expire in 2020, although a Brazilian application of the family, now under appeal, could expire later if granted. The majority of our other patent families related to nicotine biosynthesis are expected to expire between 2021 and 2036, with certain extensions of terms in the U.S. applications resulting from patent term adjustments at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. (A “patent family” is a set of patent applications and patents, filed in various countries, that relate back to at least one common earlier application.). Our Vector 21-41 VLNC tobacco plants with the QPT modification are also protected by plant variety protection (“PVP”) through 2023, which further restricts third-parties from using such plants.

The creation and production of unique tobacco plants with agronomic traits of VLNC levels, with sufficiently high germination rates and sufficiently large plant yields at harvest, among many other desirable qualities, are necessary for the plants to be sufficiently reliable to be planted at commercial scale. The expiration of a portion of the QPT patent family in 2018 provides third parties with the freedom to target the QPT gene in the tobacco plant, but such targeting of the QPT gene alone does not mean that a third party will be successful in creating a tobacco plant with altered levels of nicotine. The freedom to target the QPT gene means that a third party may conduct scientific experiments to try to discover how to alter or affect the QPT gene in ways that may or may not result in a change in nicotine levels in the tobacco plant. If a third party is able subsequently to learn, over time, how to utilize the QPT gene to alter nicotine levels in the tobacco plant, then such third party would still need to develop and create a unique tobacco plant with very low levels of nicotine (not just a “reduced nicotine” plant), which would involve, among many other things, multiple plantings over multiple generations of the plants to try to create stable and reliable VLNC plants, with no assurance that any third party could be successful in such efforts. We believe that targeting of the QPT gene alone will not result in a VLNC tobacco plant and, hence, that other genes will have to be targeted in the tobacco plant, possibly (and we believe likely) including genes and other intellectual property for which we have continuing patent protection that would need to be used, in combination with QPT to result in VLNC tobacco. However, if a third party is able, over time, to develop a tobacco plant with very low levels of nicotine, then the third party still would need to develop a VLNC plant with sufficiently high germination rates and sufficiently large plant yields at harvest for the plant to be sufficiently reliable to be planted in large quantities to support its use at commercial scale, which again would involve, among many other things, multiple plantings over multiple generations of the plants to determine the reliability and stability of the germination rates and plant yields at harvest.
 
While third parties may desire to engage in experiments with the QPT gene, we already have proprietary VLNC tobacco with germination rates, plant yields at harvest, and other desirable qualities that are acceptable to us for the plant to be sufficiently reliable to be planted at commercial scale. We have provided more than 28 million research cigarettes containing our proprietary VLNC tobacco that was grown under strict contracts with our exclusive growers and then processed and finished into cigarettes at our factory. Thus, we believe that our VLNC tobacco has the agronomic qualities that are sufficient to support its use in a commercial scale product. We are also developing our next-generation VLNC tobacco of non-GM bright, burley and Oriental VLNC tobaccos to continue to maintain our competitive advantage in being a unique provider of VLNC tobacco to third-parties that may desire to utilize our proprietary VLNC tobaccos in their finished tobacco products.
 
We also have exclusive plant variety rights in the United States (plant variety protection certificates are issued in the United States by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“PVP”)) and Canada. A PVP certificate prevents anyone other than the owner/licensee from planting, propagating, selling, importing or exporting a plant variety for twenty (20) years in the U.S. and, generally, for twenty (20) years in other member countries of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, known as UPOV, an international treaty concerning plant breeders’ rights. There are currently more than 70 countries that are members of UPOV. Our current VLNC tobaccos are protected by our patent portfolio and our Vector 21-41 VLNC tobacco is additionally protected by PVP.
 
In September 2014, we entered into a Sublicense Agreement with Anandia Laboratories, Inc. (the “Anandia Sublicense”). Under the terms of the Anandia Sublicense, we were granted an exclusive sublicense in the United States and a co-exclusive sublicense in the remainder of the world, excluding Canada, to two U.S. patents and 23 patent applications relating to genes in the hemp/cannabis plant that are required for the production of cannabinoids, the “active ingredients” in the hemp/cannabis plant. The Anandia Sublicense continues through the life of the last-to-expire patent, which is expected to be in 2035. As a plant biotechnology company, our entry into the legal hemp markets is a natural evolution of our activities in a plant that has important research and commercial value and applications. Under licenses granted by the Canadian government to Anandia, we conducted research and development on unique plant varieties of hemp at Anandia, such as (i) plants with low to no amounts of THC for the legal hemp industry, and (ii) plants with high levels of CBD and other non-THC cannabinoids for the legal medical cannabinoid markets.
 
 In addition to our patents, patent applications, and PVP certificates, we own various registered trademarks in the United States and around the world.
 
Licensing 
 
We have had negotiations with various parties in the tobacco, pharmaceutical, and hemp/cannabis industries for licensing our technology and proprietary plants and products. We believe that the FDA’s planned action to reduce nicotine in combustible cigarettes in the United States will increase opportunities for us to license our VLNC tobacco technology and plants to third-parties in the United States. Further, if the tobacco laws in foreign countries change in ways that are consistent with the WHO recommendation and that are similar to the FDA’s planned actions on reducing nicotine in cigarettes in the United States, we believe that international licensing opportunities relating to our VLNC tobacco technology and plants will increase substantially.
 
We also believe that our unique hemp plants will be highly desirable in the United States. We believe that we have many types of superior and unique plant varieties of hemp, including (i) hemp plants with other desirable agronomic traits in addition to low to no amounts of THC for the legal hemp industry and (ii) hemp plants with high levels of cannabidiol (“CBD”) and other non-THC cannabinoids for the legal medical cannabinoid markets. We are also developing other high-value medicinal cannabinoid varieties of hemp and specialized cannabinoid extraction processes for use in human therapeutics. We believe that the many uses of legal hemp in the United States and the continued growth of the hemp industry in the United States will result in hemp business opportunities and hemp licensing opportunities for our unique hemp plants and the cannabinoid extracts therefrom.

Research and Development 
 
Since our inception, the majority of our research and development (“R&D”) efforts have been outsourced to highly qualified groups in their respective fields. Since 1998, we have had multiple R&D agreements with North Carolina State University (“NCSU”) and others resulting in exclusive worldwide licenses to various patented technologies. We have utilized the same model employed by many public-sector research organizations, which entails obtaining an exclusive option or license agreement to any invention arising out of funded research. In all cases, we fund and control all patent filings as the exclusive licensee. This model of contracting with public-sector researchers has enabled us to control R&D costs while achieving our desired results, including obtaining exclusive intellectual property rights relating to our outsourced R&D.
 
In August 2016, we opened our own laboratory on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus in Buffalo, New York where we are conducting our own proprietary research and development activities in tobacco and hemp. On October 30, 2017, we obtained a New York State hemp research and grower license to support our expanding hemp activities in New York.
 
In December 2016, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with the University of Virginia (“UVA”) and an exclusive license agreement with the University of Virginia Patent Foundation d/b/a University of Virginia Licensing & Ventures Group (“UVA LVG”) pursuant to which we will invest approximately $1,000,000 over a three-year period with UVA to create unique industrial hemp plants with guaranteed levels of THC below the legal limits and to optimize other desirable hemp plant characteristics to improve the plant’s suitability for growing in Virginia and other legacy tobacco regions in the United States. This work with UVA also involves the development and study of medically important cannabinoids to be extracted by UVA from our unique hemp plants.
 
On October 19, 2017, we announced that UVA had completed its first successful harvest of our hemp plants and identified several promising hemp varieties that could form the foundation for commercial hemp production throughout the legacy tobacco regions of the United States. The 22nd Century-UVA hemp field trials used multiple oil and fiber varieties of hemp. Our hemp harvest with UVA identified proprietary varieties of hemp that have excellent agronomic properties for growth in Virginia. In 2018, we continued to use our proprietary hemp plants for plantings with UVA in Virginia. We are currently discussing 2019 planting activities with UVA. We are also working with UVA on the development of high-value medicinal cannabinoid varieties of hemp and specialized cannabinoid extraction processes for use in human therapeutics. We incurred $360,046 of expenses for the R&D agreement at UVA for the year ended December 31, 2018. UVA and 22nd Century are conducting all activities in this scientific collaboration within the parameters of state and federal licenses and permits held by UVA for such work. The agreements with UVA and UVA LVG grant 22nd Century exclusive rights to commercialize all results of the collaboration in consideration of royalty payments by our Company to UVA LVG.
 
We committed to an R&D agreement with NCSU relating to nicotine biosynthesis in tobacco plants and incurred $162,408 in R&D expenses for the period from February 2014 through January 2016. We extended the agreement through January 31, 2017 at an additional cost of $85,681. In February of 2018, we finalized an additional extension to the agreement through April 30, 2018 at a cost of $88,344. In May 2018, we finalized an additional extension to the agreement through April 30, 2019 at a total cost of $121,357. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we expensed $169,249, $7,140, and $78,541, respectively, relating to this extended R&D agreement.
 
On June 22, 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to its existing license agreement with NCSU under which the Company exclusively licensed several bright and burley tobacco plant lines with Very Low Nicotine Content that are not genetically modified (non-GM) plants.  The amendment provides for the Company to pay NCSU a total exclusive license fee of $1,200,000, of which $500,000 was paid by the Company to NCSU within five business days after the execution of the amendment, $400,000 will be paid on the one-year anniversary of the execution of the amendment, and $300,000 will be paid on the two-year anniversary of the execution of the amendment.  The Company will also pay running royalties to NCSU based on a portion of the net sales revenue received by the Company from sales of products that contain any portions of the plant materials that have been received by the Company from NCSU.
 
On October 22, 2018, the Company entered into a license with the University of Kentucky (“UK”) to license on a non-exclusive basis a next-generation very low nicotine burley tobacco plant line.  The UK license agreement provides for the Company to pay UK a total exclusive license fee of $1,200,000, of which $300,000 was paid by the Company to UK after the delivery by UK to the Company of certain very low nicotine burley tobacco seeds, $300,000 will be paid on the later of the one-year anniversary of the license agreement or the delivery by UK to the Company of chemical analysis of the field grown plants from such very low nicotine burley tobacco seeds, $300,000 will be paid on the later of the two-year anniversary of the license or the delivery by UK to the Company of certain other very low nicotine burley tobacco seeds, and the final installment payment of $300,000 will be paid on the later of the three-year anniversary of the license agreement or the delivery by UK to the Company of seeds of male sterile versions of each of the very low nicotine plants grown by UK for the Company from the seeds provided by UK to the Company.  The Company will also pay running royalties to UK based on a portion of the net sales revenue received by the Company from sales of products that contain any portions of the plant materials that have been received by the Company from UK.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we incurred total R&D expenses of $14,989,746, $3,366,468, and $2,340,958, respectively. The R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 include approximately $9,800,000 in expenses relating to our PMTA and MRTPA, submitted to the FDA in December 2018, and approximately $1,230,000 in equity-based compensation expense recognized due the death in April 2018 of James Swauger, our Vice President of Science and Regulatory Affairs.
 
MSA Membership
 
In September 2013, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “NASCO Acquisition”) to purchase all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of NASCO, a federally licensed tobacco product manufacturer and subsequent participating manufacturer under the Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”). The MSA is an accord reached in November 1998 between the State Attorneys General of 46 states, five U.S. territories, the District of Columbia and the five largest tobacco companies in the United States concerning the advertising, marketing and promotion of tobacco products. The MSA also set standards for, and imposes restrictions on, the sale and marketing of cigarettes by participating cigarette manufacturers. On August 29, 2014, we entered into an Amended Adherence Agreement with the 46 Settling States under the MSA pursuant to which the Company was approved to acquire NASCO and become a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA. On that same date, we closed the NASCO Acquisition and became a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA. NASCO has since been a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company.

Manufacturing
 
We lease a cigarette manufacturing facility and warehouse located in Mocksville, North Carolina. In 2013, we purchased certain (i) cigarette manufacturing equipment, and (ii) equipment parts, factory items, office furniture and fixtures, vehicles and computers from the bankruptcy estate of PTM Technologies, Inc. for approximately $3.22 million.
 
The facility was primarily in a pre-manufacturing stage during 2014 as we sought approval during that time for us to become a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA. Since August 29, 2014, the Company has been a subsequent participating manufacture under the MSA. Since 2015, we have manufactured and sold our SPECTRUM® government research cigarettes, together with a third-party MSA cigarette brand and several third-party filtered cigar brands, at our factory in North Carolina.
 
Our strategic acquisition of our factory has allowed us to become vertically integrated so that we can control production priorities/timing and maintain the required high quality of our products, including our SPECTRUM® research cigarettes. In the future, our factory will also allow us to produce our own VLNC cigarette brands in the event they comply with the FDA mandate for reduced nicotine in cigarettes, as well as our BRAND A VLNC cigarettes if/when the FDA approves our PMTA and MRTPA submissions for BRAND A under our proposed product name of VLNTM.
 
Sources of Raw Materials 
 
We obtain a large portion of our tobacco leaf from farmers in multiple states in the United States who are under direct contracts with us. These contracts prohibit the transfer of our proprietary tobaccos, seeds and plant materials to other parties. We purchase the balance of our tobacco through third parties. As we prepare for the anticipated increased need for our proprietary VLNC tobacco in the United States in the event the FDA mandates that all combustible cigarettes contain only minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine and/or in the event the FDA approves our PMTA and MRTPA for our BRAND A VLNC cigarettes under the proposed product name of VLNTM, we intend to increase the amount of tobacco leaf we obtain directly from farmers under contract, both in the United States and in foreign countries.
 
We likewise grow hemp ourselves and under contracts with farmers that prohibit the transfer of our proprietary seeds and plant materials to other parties.
 
Government Regulation
 
FDA Mandate to Require Minimally or Non-Addictive Levels of Nicotine in all Cigarettes in the United States
 
The Tobacco Control Act, which became law in June 2009, granted the FDA authority over the regulation of all tobacco products in the United States. While the Tobacco Control Act prohibits the FDA from banning cigarettes outright, or mandating that nicotine levels be reduced to zero, it does allow the FDA to require the reduction of nicotine or other compounds in tobacco and cigarette smoke. In 2009, the Tobacco Control Act also banned all sales in the United States of cigarettes with flavored tobacco (other than menthol). As of June 2010, all cigarette companies were required to cease use of the terms “low tar,” “light” and “ultra light” in describing cigarettes sold in the United States.
 
On July 28, 2017, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., announced the FDA’s plan to exercise its authority under the Tobacco Control Act to require that all combustible cigarettes sold in the United States contain only minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine. On March 16, 2018, the FDA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPRM”) to obtain information for consideration in developing a tobacco product standard to set the maximum nicotine level for cigarettes. The FDA is engaging in a required rule-making process to enact such new nicotine reduction regulations. It is uncertain how long the FDA rule-making process will take to complete.
 
We believe this regulatory environment represents a paradigm shift for the tobacco industry and will create opportunities for us in marketing BRAND A under our proposed product name of VLNTM and in licensing our proprietary technology and/or tobaccos to larger competitors. On July 16, 2018, we publicly submitted to the FDA our formal written response to the ANPRM in which we described how (i) the FDA’s proposed new rule is supported by rigorous independent, published science, (ii) the FDA’s stated goal to render cigarettes minimally or non-addictive is immediately feasible as evidenced by our production and delivery of more than 28 million VLNC research cigarettes since the year 2011, and (iii) the FDA’s proposed new rule is exceedingly practical and urgently needed in the interests of public health.
 
Modified Risk Cigarettes
 
The Tobacco Control Act establishes procedures for the FDA to regulate the labeling and marketing of Modified Risk Tobacco Products, which includes cigarettes marketed to (i) reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease or (ii) reduce or eliminate exposure to a substance (“Modified Risk Cigarettes”). The Tobacco Control Act required the FDA to issue specific regulations and/or guidance regarding applications submitted to the FDA for the authorization to label and market Modified Risk Tobacco Products. On March 30, 2012, the FDA issued Modified Risk Tobacco Product Applications Draft Guidance. On December 5, 2018, we submitted a new PMTA to the FDA and on December 27, 2018, we submitted a new MRTPA to the FDA, in each case for our BRAND A Very Low Nicotine Content cigarettes for which we are requesting a reduced exposure marketing authorization from the FDA to market BRAND A as a Modified Risk Cigarette with product labeling that includes the proposed brand name of VLNTM and states that the VLNTM product has 95% less nicotine than conventional cigarettes. We believe that our VLNTM cigarettes will qualify as Modified Risk Cigarettes. We believe that obtaining FDA authorization to promote our VLNTM cigarettes as Modified Risk Cigarettes will create opportunities for us to market our own unique product and license our proprietary technology and/or our tobaccos to larger competitors.

We supply our proprietary cigarettes for use by independent researchers so studies can be conducted to obtain additional information on our products. We expect this information will assist us, along with our own funded studies, in obtaining the necessary FDA authorizations to market BRAND A under our proposed product name of VLNTM as a Modified Risk Cigarette.


Hemp
 
On December 20, 2018, the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, which is also known as the “2018 Farm Bill,” was enacted and, among other things, further legalized hemp under U.S. federal law, but with compliance still being required with all applicable state hemp laws. The 2018 Farm Bill includes certain benefits for the hemp industry in the United States, including: (i) the extension of the protections for hemp research and researchers and the conditions in which hemp research can be done, (ii) the protection of hemp farmers and hemp production under federal crop insurance programs, (iii) the permitting of the cultivation, interstate transportation and sale of hemp and hemp products in the U.S. in compliance with all other applicable federal and state laws, and (iv) the removal of hemp and hemp derived products from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”). However, the FDA has publicly stated that certain products derived from hemp, including cannabidiol (“CBD”), which is a cannabinoid that can be extracted from hemp, will be regulated by the FDA. Thus, participants in the hemp industry will need to comply with all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations in the cultivation, transportation and sale of hemp and hemp derived products.
 
As of December 31, 2018, (i) federal law and the laws of 40 states in the United States and the District of Columbia have legalized hemp, (ii) 33 states in the United States and the District of Columbia have laws and/or regulations that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate medical uses for cannabis/marijuana and consumer use of cannabis/marijuana in connection with medical treatment, and (iii) 10 states in the United States and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis/marijuana for adult recreational use. Many other states are considering similar legislation. Conversely, under the federal CSA, the policies and regulations of the federal government and its agencies are that cannabis/marijuana has no medical benefit and a range of activities are prohibited, including cultivation, possession, personal use and interstate distribution of cannabis/marijuana. In the event the U.S. Department of Justice begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical and/or adult recreational cannabis/marijuana, there may be a direct and adverse impact to any future potential business or prospects that we may have in the cannabis/marijuana business. However, our current activities involve only work with legal hemp, which would continue since our hemp activities are permitted under applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations.
 
Competition
 
We are not currently aware of any competition to our VLNC tobacco inside or outside of the United States.
 
We are not aware of any competition to our Company in the creation and provision of VLNC tobacco research cigarettes for use in independent clinical studies. Since 2011, we have provided more than 28 million research cigarettes containing our proprietary tobaccos, including our VLNC tobacco, for use in numerous independent clinical studies at many well-known study locations, with agencies of the United States federal government investing more than $125 million in such independent clinical studies. The results of those independent clinical studies have been published in peer-reviewed publications. We are not aware of any other independent clinical studies that have been published regarding any other VLNC tobacco research cigarettes.
 
The results of such numerous completed and on-going clinical studies provide independent scientific support for the public announcement on July 28, 2017 by the FDA that the FDA plans to mandate that all combustible cigarettes sold in the United States will be required to contain only minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine. Since our proprietary VLNC tobacco has been the subject of numerous completed and on-going, independent clinical studies paid for by agencies of the U.S. federal government, we are investigating the use of our VLNC tobacco in our own products that will be intended to comply with the new FDA regulations, as well as we are investigating the license of the use of our VLNC tobacco by third-parties. It is possible that other companies may develop products that also comply with the new FDA regulations in ways that we do not know of at this time since the FDA is still in the rule-making process. There is also no assurance that the FDA will actually implement such regulations on a timely basis or at all. We are also investigating potential opportunities relating to our VLNC tobacco outside of the United States. 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we no longer sold any Company-owned commercial cigarette brands in the United States. During the year of 2017, we ceased the selling of our RED SUN brand and, during the year 2018, we continued manufacturing a third-party MSA cigarette brand for the third-party owner of that brand. Cigarette companies compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising, retail shelf space, and price. Cigarette sales can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors’ introduction of low-price products or innovative products, higher taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products. Domestic cigarette competitors included Philip Morris USA Inc., Reynolds American Inc., Lorillard Inc., Commonwealth Brands, Inc., Liggett Group LLC, and Vector Tobacco Inc. International competitors included Philip Morris International Inc., British American Tobacco, JT International SA, Imperial Tobacco Group PLC and regional and local tobacco companies; and in some instances, government-owned tobacco enterprises such as the China National Tobacco Corporation.

In the event the FDA approves our PMTA/MRTPA for BRAND A under our proposed product name of VLNTM, then it is possible that BRAND A may compete with FDA-approved smoking cessation aids. In the market for FDA-approved smoking cessation aids, our principal competitors would include Pfizer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Perrigo Company plc, Novartis International AG, and Niconovum AB, a subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc. The industry consists of major domestic and international companies, most of which have existing relationships in the markets into which we plan to sell, as well as financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, scaling capacity, distribution and other resources, and name recognition substantially greater than ours.
