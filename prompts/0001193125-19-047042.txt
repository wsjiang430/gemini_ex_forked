Item 1. Business of Community Health Systems, Inc.
Overview of Our Company 
 We are one of the largest publicly-traded hospital companies in the United States and a leading operator of general acute care hospitals and outpatient facilities in communities across the country. We were originally founded in 1986 and were reincorporated in 1996 as a Delaware corporation. We provide healthcare services through the hospitals that we own and operate and affiliated businesses in non-urban and selected urban markets throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we owned or leased 113 hospitals with an aggregate of 18,227 licensed beds, comprised of 111 general acute care hospitals and two stand-alone rehabilitation or psychiatric hospitals. These hospitals are geographically diversified across 20 states, with the majority of our hospitals located in regional networks or in close geographic proximity to one or more of our other hospitals. We generate revenues by providing a broad range of general and specialized hospital healthcare services and outpatient services to patients in the communities in which we are located. Services provided through our hospitals and affiliated businesses include general acute care, emergency room, general and specialty surgery, critical care, internal medicine, obstetrics, diagnostic, psychiatric and rehabilitation services. We also provide additional outpatient services at urgent care centers, occupational medicine clinics, imaging centers, cancer centers and ambulatory surgery centers. An integral part of providing these services is our network of affiliated physicians at our hospitals and affiliated businesses. As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 2,000 physicians and an additional 1,000 licensed healthcare practitioners. Through our management and operation of these businesses, we provide standardization and centralization of operations across key business areas; strategic assistance to expand and improve services and facilities; implementation of patient safety and quality of care improvement programs and assistance in the recruitment of additional physicians and licensed healthcare practitioners to the markets in which our hospitals are located. In a number of our markets, we have partnered with local physicians or not-for-profit providers, or both, in the ownership of our facilities. 
 We have been implementing a portfolio rationalization and deleveraging strategy by divesting hospitals and non-hospital businesses that are attractive to strategic and other buyers. Generally, these businesses are not in one of our strategically beneficial service areas, are less complementary to our business strategy and/or have lower operating margins. In connection with our divestiture initiative, strategic buyers have made offers to buy certain of our assets. Through consideration of these offers we have divested or may divest hospitals and non-hospital businesses when we find such offers to be attractive and in line with our operating strategy. In 2018, we divested 11 hospitals for total net proceeds of approximately $405 million. In 2017, we divested 30 hospitals for total net proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion. 
 Additionally, as part of our portfolio rationalization strategy, on April 29, 2016, we completed a spin-off of 38 hospitals and Quorum Health Resources, LLC, or QHR (our former subsidiary through which we provided management advisory and consulting services to non-affiliated general acute care hospitals located throughout the United States), into Quorum Health Corporation, or QHC, and distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of QHC common stock to our stockholders of record as of April 22, 2016. In recognition of the spin-off, we recorded a non-cash dividend of approximately $713 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, representing the net assets of QHC distributed to our stockholders. Financial and statistical data reported in this Form 10-K include QHC operating results through the spin-off date. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement as well as certain ancillary agreements with QHC on April 29, 2016. 
 Throughout this Form 10-K, we refer to Community Health Systems, Inc., or the Parent Company, and its consolidated subsidiaries in a simplified manner and on a collective basis, using words like we, our, us and the Company. This drafting style is suggested by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and is not meant to indicate that the publicly-traded Parent Company or any particular subsidiary of the Parent Company owns or operates any asset, business or property.

Our Business Strategy 
 Our objective is to provide safe, high-quality healthcare for our patients and the communities we serve. We are committed to efficient, cost effective and profitable operations that seek to ensure sustainable health systems and deliver long-term shareholder value. Our efforts are focused around the following key strategies, which are designed to help us achieve our objectives: 

 | Become a market leader and increase market share in the communities we serve;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increase productivity and operating efficiencies to enhance profitability;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continuously improve patient safety and quality of care; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | Optimize our portfolio through select divestitures of non-core assets while investing in markets with the best opportunities for growth.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Become a market leader and increase market share in the communities we serve 
 We operate across diverse markets that range from sole community providers to large regional networks. We are able to leverage our significant scale and standardized systems to provide cost-effective services and best practices for our affiliate operations. Each of our markets develops and executes a strategic plan with short and long-term goals, based on their unique opportunities and the needs of their respective communities. As an organization, we also have implemented a number of strategic initiatives designed to improve market position, expand services to our patients, and capture a greater share of healthcare spending in our markets. These include: 
 

 | Strengthening regional networks and local market operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expanding patient access points, health services and infrastructure;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Recruiting and/or employing additional primary care physicians and specialists; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Developing a more consumer-centric experience and facilitating connections between episodes of care.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Strengthening Regional Networks and Local Market Operations. We believe opportunities exist in select markets to create healthcare networks consisting of multiple hospitals and corresponding outpatient services. Regional networks are able to expand the breadth of services provided for our patients, develop centers of excellence for key services, deliver care in an organized and efficient way across the network, improve alignment with physicians and other providers, and make services more attractive to managed care and other payers. Currently, 79 of our hospitals operate in 22 regional networks. 
 
2 
 
We also operate healthcare systems that are built around a single acute-care hospital. In these markets, we are focused on supporting the hospital with physician practices, outpatient services, clinical collaborations and partnerships that offer our patients health services across the continuum of care. These hospitals and their related outpatient services may operate in competitive markets or as sole community providers. 
 Expanding Patient Access Points, Health Services and Infrastructure. When expanding services  in both the acute and non-acute care settings  our approach is data-driven and strategic to ensure our investments are responsive to community and patient needs and produce sound financial results. While we continue to provide health services across a broad spectrum, we have focused our attention and resources on service lines we believe have the greatest potential for growth, including primary care, emergency medicine, orthopedics, neuroscience, cardiovascular care, surgical services and behavioral health. As the shift to delivering health services in outpatient settings accelerates, we continue to expand our care offerings beyond hospital walls to include more outpatient access through primary care practices, urgent care centers, free-standing emergency departments, ambulatory surgery centers, imaging and diagnostic centers, retail clinics and direct-to-consumer virtual health visits. 
 We believe expanding our patient access footprint can attract new patients and increase patient retention, as well as our ability to connect patients from one episode of care to the next appropriate care setting. We also believe our investments will enhance our long-term growth and generate increased revenue, earnings, and operating margins by providing a solid return on investment. 
 Recruiting and/or Employing Additional Primary Care Physicians and Specialists. The physician-patient relationship is the foundation on which all healthcare services are built. Understanding this, we continuously assess our communities to identify service gaps and practice opportunities in order to recruit an optimal mix of primary care physicians and specialists. We analyze demographic data and referral trends and employ recruiters at the corporate level to support local hospital administrators in their physician recruitment efforts. In some markets, we employ physicians, often acquiring their practices at the onset of the arrangement. However, most physicians in our communities and on our medical staffs remain in private practice and are not our employees. 
 We work hard to develop positive, collaborative relationships with physicians. We currently have fifteen Medicare Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organizations which include approximately 4,500 employed and independent physicians in our communities. We look forward to realizing the benefits of these Accountable Care Organizations, including opportunities to strengthen quality, deepen clinical collaboration and demonstrate performance under a reimbursement system moving toward more value-based incentives and payments. 
 Developing a More Consumer-Centric Experience and Facilitating Connections between Episodes of Care. Consumers continue to take a more active role in healthcare decision-making, especially as they assume increasing responsibility for the cost of their healthcare. The rise in consumerism is highlighting customer expectations that have not always been prioritized in the healthcare setting. We are working on ways to create more enduring relationships with our patients by providing services that help people navigate their healthcare journeys and enable more seamless connections across episodes in our healthcare systems, hospitals, and physician practices. Some of these initiatives include: 
 

 | A centralized and proprietary transfer center offering services to connect emergency department and hospitalized patients requiring transfer to facilities that can best meet their needs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Centralized patient scheduling call centers and online scheduling to ease appointment scheduling;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Patient navigation and next appointment scheduling from existing points of care;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Availability of virtual health for certain services provided in the hospital and for direct-to-consumer, on-demand virtual visits with physicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
3 
 

 | Digital marketing and consumer engagement campaigns; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | Technology enabled initiatives that support connected healthcare experiences, such as patient portals, text message appointment reminders, gaps-in-care campaigns and post-discharge surveys.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Increase productivity and operating efficiencies to enhance profitability 
 Our hospital management teams are supported by experienced corporate leaders who have significant industry knowledge and a proven track record of success. Local hospitals benefit from centralized clinical, operational, financial and regulatory expertise that encompasses nearly every aspect of our business. Additionally, we are able to leverage deep and meaningful data sources to facilitate informed decision-making and drive operational improvements across the enterprise in areas such as drug and supply procurement, workforce optimization and staffing and emergency department and operating room performance. 
 Standard policies and procedures in areas ranging from physician practice management to patient accounting to construction and facilities management help to facilitate best practices, reduce variation and improve operating results. The following areas highlight some of our standardized and centralized platforms. 
 Billing and Collections. We have adopted standard policies and procedures with respect to billing and collections. We have automated various components of the collection cycle, including statements and collection letters, to help facilitate timely and accurate progression of our accounts through the collection cycle. We have consolidated local billing and collection functions into six centralized business offices and have completed the transition of our hospital billing departments to this new infrastructure. We are now realizing the benefits of lower patient claim denials, higher underpayment recoveries and reduced operating expenses. 
 Physician Support. We support newly recruited physicians to facilitate a smooth and effective transition into our communities. Newly recruited physicians participate in orientation that covers matters related to starting up a new practice or joining an established practice. For employed physicians, we utilize software solutions that monitor and help optimize their practice performance against industry standard benchmarks and best practices. We also have implemented programs to improve physician workflow, reduce physician turnover, optimize staffing at physician clinics and standardize onboarding processes. 
 Procurement and Materials Management. We have standardized and centralized supply chain operations to improve procurement of the medical supplies, equipment and pharmaceuticals used in our hospitals. We have an ownership interest in and participation agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P., or HealthTrust, a group purchasing organization, or GPO, which benefits members through scaled pricing. HealthTrust contracts with certain vendors who supply a substantial portion of our medical supplies, equipment and pharmaceuticals. 
 Case and Resource Management. The primary goal of our case management program is to deliver safe, high-quality care in an efficient and cost effective manner. The program focuses on: 
 

 | Appropriate management of length of stay consistent with national standards and benchmarks;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Reducing unnecessary utilization;
--+----------------------------------


 | Developing and implementing operational best practices;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


 | Discharge planning; and
--+------------------------


 | Compliance with applicable regulatory standards.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 Our case management program integrates the functions of utilization review, discharge planning, assessment of medical necessity and resource management. Patients are assessed upon presentation to the hospital and throughout their course of care with ongoing reviews. Industry standard criteria are utilized in patient

 assessments and discharge plans are adjusted according to patient needs. Cases are monitored to prevent delays in service or unnecessary utilization of resources. When a patient is ready for discharge, a case manager works with the patients attending physician to evaluate and coordinate the patients needs for continued care in the post-acute setting. Each hospital has the support of a physician advisor to act as a liaison to the medical staff and assist with all the activities of the program. 
 Other Initiatives. Numerous other initiatives have been standardized or centralized and leverage data to reduce costs and increase productivity. For example, we have improved staff scheduling and efficiency by implementing standardized time keeping systems and we have implemented initiatives to reduce unnecessary overtime and guide temporary staffing decisions that align with patient admissions and acuity. We have created a centralized team and implemented standard processes for payroll processing and management of accounts payable. Likewise, we have leveraged data and expertise to optimize our performance in clinical and operating areas such as emergency room, pharmacy, laboratory, imaging and skilled nursing services and health information management. Each time we implement a new process initiative, we work to identify and communicate best practices and we monitor progress and performance improvement throughout the organization. 
Continuously Improve Patient Safety and Quality of Care 
 We maintain quality assurance programs to monitor, support and advance quality of care standards and to meet Medicare and Medicaid accreditation and regulatory requirements. We maintain an emphasis on patient safety and clinical outcomes and we are continuously focused on ways to improve patient, physician and employee satisfaction. We believe that a focus on continuous improvement yields the best results for patients, reduces risk and liability, and creates value for the people and communities we serve. 
 We have developed and implemented programs to support and monitor patient safety and quality of care that include: 
 

 | Standardized data and benchmarks to monitor clinical outcomes, hospital performance and quality improvement efforts;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Recommended policies and procedures based on medical and scientific evidence;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Training with evidence-based tools for improving patient safety and quality of care and patient, physician and employee satisfaction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Leveraging technology and information sharing around evidence-based clinical best practices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Training programs for hospital management and clinical staff regarding regulatory and reporting requirements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Implementation of specific leadership methods and error-prevention tools to create safer care environments for patients and staff.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have operated a Patient Safety Organization, or PSO, since 2011. Our PSO is listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. We believe our PSO has assisted, and will continue to assist us, in improving patient safety at our hospitals. The PSO has been recertified through 2019. 
 Optimize our portfolio through select divestitures of non-core assets while investing in markets with the best opportunities for growth 
 We have been reshaping our portfolio through the divestiture of non-core hospital and non-hospital assets to strategic and other buyers. In 2019, we intend to divest additional hospitals in select markets. Generally, these divested assets are less complementary to our business strategies and/or have lower operating margins. We have used, and expect to continue to use, proceeds from divestitures to reduce debt. 
 
5 
 
By divesting non-core assets, we are able to more sharply channel our resources and capital investments into strategic markets where we have the best ability to increase access and patient care, enhance our service lines, form successful joint ventures, produce growth and increase market share. As an example, we acquired 43 physician practices in 2018. 
 Our portfolio optimization efforts have included several transactions to date. In 2017, we divested 30 hospitals in single and multi-hospital transactions. In 2018, we divested an additional 11 hospitals in single and multi-hospital transactions. We also closed three non-core hospitals in 2018 in locations where the operations could be absorbed by one or more hospitals in the same regional network. 
 Industry Overview 
 According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, national healthcare expenditures grew 3.9% in 2017 to $3.5 trillion and are projected to have grown 5.3% in 2018 to nearly $3.7 trillion. The CMS projections, published in February of 2018, indicate that total U.S. healthcare spending is expected to grow by 5.5% in 2019 and 2020, and at an average annual rate of 5.7% for 2021 through 2026. CMS anticipates that total U.S. healthcare annual expenditures will reach $5.7 trillion by 2026, accounting for approximately 19.7% of the total U.S. gross domestic product. Healthcare spending is expected to be largely influenced by changes in economic conditions and demographics, as well as by increasing prices for medical goods and services. The CMS projections are constructed using a current-law framework. They are typically published once per year and are not updated to reflect interim changes. For example, the projections do not take into account the possibility of further modifications to, or repeal of, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act. 
 Hospital services, the market within the healthcare industry in which we primarily operate, is the largest single category of healthcare expenditures. In 2018, hospital care expenditures are projected to have grown 5.1%, amounting to nearly $1.2 trillion. CMS estimates that the hospital services category will amount to nearly $1.3 trillion in 2019 and projects growth in this category at an average of 5.7% annually from 2019 through 2026. 
 U.S. Hospital Industry. The U.S. hospital industry is broadly defined to include acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric facilities that are either public (government owned and operated), not-for-profit private (religious or secular), or for-profit institutions (investor owned). According to the American Hospital Association, there are approximately 5,300 community hospitals in the U.S., which are not-for-profit owned, investor owned, or state or local government owned. Of these hospitals, nearly 40% are located in non-urban communities. We believe that a majority of these hospitals are owned by not-for-profit or governmental entities. These facilities offer a broad range of healthcare services, including internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, orthopedics, OB/GYN and emergency services. In addition, hospitals offer other ancillary services, including psychiatric, diagnostic, rehabilitation, home care and outpatient surgery services. 
 Factors Affecting Performance. Among the many factors that can influence a hospitals financial and operating performance are: 
 

 | facility size and location;
--+----------------------------


 | facility ownership structure (e.g., tax-exempt or investor owned);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a facilitys ability to participate in GPOs, such as HealthTrust; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | facility payor mix.
--+--------------------

 Patients needing the most complex care are more often served by the larger and/or more specialized urban hospitals. We believe opportunities exist in selected urban markets to create networks between urban hospitals and non-urban hospitals in order to expand the breadth of services offered in the non-urban hospitals while improving physician alignment in those markets and making them more attractive to managed care organizations.

Hospital Industry Trends 
 Demographic Trends. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2017, there were approximately 51 million Americans aged 65 or older in the U.S. comprising approximately 15.6% of the total U.S. population. By the year 2030, the number of Americans aged 65 or older is expected to climb to 72 million, or 19.3% of the total population. Due to the anticipated increasing life expectancy of Americans, the number of people aged 85 years and older is also expected to increase from 6 million in 2015 to 9 million by the year 2030. This anticipated increase in life expectancy will increase demand for healthcare services and, as importantly, the demand for innovative, more sophisticated means of delivering those services. Hospitals, as the largest category of care in the healthcare market, will be among those impacted most directly by this increase in demand. Based on data compiled for us, the populations of the service areas where our hospitals are located grew 6.9% from 2011 to 2018 and are expected to grow by 4.2% from 2018 to 2023. The number of people aged 65 or older in these service areas grew by 26.8% from 2011 to 2018 and is expected to grow by 16.8% from 2018 to 2023. People aged 65 or older comprised 17.5% of the total population in our service areas in 2018, yet they could comprise 19.6% of the total population in our service areas by 2023. 
 Consolidation. In addition to our own acquisitions and dispositions in recent years, consolidation activity in the hospital industry, primarily through mergers and acquisitions involving both for-profit and not-for-profit hospital systems, is continuing. Reasons for this activity include: 
 

 | ample supply of available capital;
--+-----------------------------------


 | valuation levels;
--+------------------


 | financial performance issues, including challenges associated with changes in reimbursement and collectability of self-pay revenue;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the desire to enhance the local availability of healthcare in the community;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the need and ability to recruit primary care physicians and specialists;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the need to achieve general economies of scale and to gain access to standardized and centralized functions, including favorable supply agreements and access to malpractice coverage;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | changes to healthcare payment models that emphasize cost-effective delivery of service and quality of outcomes for the entire episode of care; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | regulatory changes.
--+--------------------

 The payor industry is also consolidating and acquiring health services providers in an effort to offer more expansive, competitive programs. 
 Trends in Payment for Healthcare Services. As discussed in more detail in the Government Regulation section of this Form 10-K, the impact of healthcare reform legislation, combined with the growing financial and economic pressures on the healthcare industry, has resulted in challenges to traditional reimbursement trends. For example, the Affordable Care Act has encouraged the adoption of new payment models that emphasize cost-effective delivery of care and quality of outcomes. Although the number of patients with health insurance coverage has expanded, patients may face higher deductibles and increased co-payment requirements, which may result in greater write-offs of uncollectible amounts from those patients. 
 Shift to Outpatient Services. Because of the growing availability of stand-alone outpatient healthcare facilities and the increase in the services that can be provided at these locations, many individuals are seeking a broader range of services at outpatient facilities. This trend has contributed to an increase in outpatient services while inhibiting the growth of inpatient admissions. However, recent changes to Medicare policy affecting the reimbursement methodology for certain items and services provided by off-campus provider-based hospital departments have generally resulted in reduced payment rates for hospital outpatient settings.

Adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is EBITDA adjusted to add back net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and to exclude the effect of discontinued operations, loss (gain) from early extinguishment of debt, impairment and (gain) loss on sale of businesses, gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, expense incurred related to the spin-off of QHC, expense incurred related to the sale of a majority ownership interest in the Companys home care division, expense (income) related to government and other legal settlements and related costs, expense related to employee termination benefits and other restructuring charges, expense (income) from settlement and fair value adjustments on the CVR agreement liability related to the Health Management Associates, Inc., or HMA, legal proceedings and related legal expenses, and the overall impact of the change in estimate related to net patient revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the increase in contractual allowances and the provision for bad debts. The Company has from time to time sold noncontrolling interests in certain of its subsidiaries or acquired subsidiaries with existing noncontrolling interest ownership positions. The Company believes that it is useful to present Adjusted EBITDA because it adds back the portion of EBITDA attributable to these third-party interests and clarifies for investors the Companys portion of EBITDA generated by continuing operations. The Company reports Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used

by management to assess the operating performance of the Companys hospital operations and to make decisions on the allocation of resources. Adjusted EBITDA is also used to evaluate the performance of the Companys executive management team and is one of the primary targets used to determine short-term cash incentive compensation. In addition, management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA in assessing the Companys consolidated results of operations and operational performance and in comparing the Companys results of operations between periods. The Company believes it is useful to provide investors and other users of the Companys financial statements this performance measure to align with how management assesses the Companys results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA also is comparable to a similar metric called Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Companys senior secured credit facility, which is a key component in the determination of the Companys compliance with some of the covenants under the Companys senior secured credit facility (including the Companys ability to service debt and incur capital expenditures), and is used to determine the interest rate and commitment fee payable under the senior secured credit facility (although Adjusted EBITDA does not include all of the adjustments described in the senior secured credit facility). For further discussion of Consolidated EBITDA and how that measure is utilized in the calculation of our debt covenants, see the Capital Resources section of Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other performance measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance. The Company believes such adjustments are appropriate as the magnitude and frequency of such items can vary significantly and are not related to the assessment of normal operating performance. Additionally, this calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Sources of Revenue 
 The following table presents the approximate percentages of net operating revenues by payor source for the periods indicated. The data for the periods presented are not strictly comparable due to the effect that hospital acquisitions and divestitures have had on these statistics. The percentages of net operating revenues for 2017 also include the overall impact of the change in estimate recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to increase contractual allowances and record additional provision for bad debts. 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
Medicare | | 26.3 | % | | 27.8 | % | 27.2 | %
Medicaid | | 13.3 | | | 13.2 | | 11.9 | 
Managed Care and other third-party payors | | 59.0 | | | 59.8 | | 58.4 | 
Self-pay | | 1.4 | | | (0.8) | | 2.5 | 
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

As shown above, we receive a substantial portion of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Included in Managed Care and other third-party payors is operating revenues from insurance companies with which we have insurance provider contracts, Medicare managed care, insurance companies for which we do not have insurance provider contracts, workers compensation carriers and non-patient service revenue, such as rental income and cafeteria sales. In the future, we generally expect the portion of our revenues to be received from the Medicare and Medicaid programs to increase due to the general aging of the population. In addition, the Affordable Care Act has increased the number of insured patients in states that have expanded Medicaid, which in turn, has reduced the percentage of revenues from self-pay patients. However, it is unclear whether the trend of increased coverage will continue, due in part to the elimination of the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Affordable Care Act imposes significant reductions in amounts the government pays Medicare managed care plans. The trend toward increased enrollment in Medicare managed care may adversely affect our operating revenue growth. Other provisions in the Affordable Care Act impose minimum medical-loss ratios and require insurers to meet specific benefit requirements. Furthermore, in the normal course of business, managed care programs, insurance companies and employers actively negotiate the amounts paid to hospitals. The trend toward increased enrollment in managed care may adversely affect our operating revenue growth. There can be no assurance that we will retain our existing reimbursement arrangements or that these third-party payors will not attempt to further reduce the rates they pay for our services. 
 Net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost-based reimbursement and other payment methods. In addition, we are reimbursed by non-governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies. Amounts we receive for the treatment of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and non-governmental payors are generally less than the standard billing rates. We account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual allowance adjustments, which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues. Final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties. We account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual allowance adjustments and report them in the periods that such adjustments become known. Contractual allowance adjustments related to final settlements and previous program reimbursement estimates impacted net operating revenues and net loss by an insignificant amount in each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
 The payment rates under the Medicare program for hospital inpatient and outpatient acute care services are based on a prospective payment system, depending upon the diagnosis of a patients condition. These rates are indexed for inflation annually, although increases have historically been less than actual inflation. On August 2, 2018, CMS issued the final rule to increase this index by 2.9% for hospital inpatient acute care services that are reimbursed under the prospective payment system, beginning October 1, 2018. The final rule provides for a 0.8% multifactor productivity reduction, 0.75% reduction to hospital inpatient rates implemented pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, and a positive 0.5% adjustment in accordance with the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which will yield an estimated net 1.85% increase in reimbursement for hospitals. An additional reduction applies to hospitals that do not submit required patient quality data. We are complying with this data submission requirement. Payments may also be affected by admission and medical review criteria for inpatient services commonly known as the two midnight rule. Under the rule, for admissions on or after October 1, 2013, services to Medicare beneficiaries are only payable as inpatient hospital services when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically necessary and will be required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. Stays expected to need less than two midnights of hospital care are subject to medical review on a case-by-case basis. Reductions in the rate of increase or overall reductions in Medicare reimbursement may cause a decline in the growth of our net operating revenues. 
 Currently, several states utilize supplemental reimbursement programs for the purpose of providing reimbursement to providers to offset a portion of the cost of providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. These programs are designed with input from CMS and are funded with a combination of state and federal resources, including, in certain instances, fees or taxes levied on the providers. Similar programs are also being 
 
12 
 
 considered by other states. The programs are generally authorized for a specified period of time and require CMSs approval to be extended. CMS has indicated that it will take into account a states status with respect to expanding its Medicaid program in considering whether to extend these supplemental programs. We are unable to predict whether or on what terms CMS will extend the supplemental programs in the states in which we operate. As a result of existing supplemental programs, we recognize revenue and related expenses in the period in which the fixed and determinable amounts are estimable and collection is reasonably assured. Reimbursement under these programs is reflected in net operating revenues and included as Medicaid revenue in the table above, and fees, taxes or other program related costs are reflected in other operating expenses. 
 As of December 31, 2018, Florida, Texas and Indiana represented our only areas of significant geographic concentration. Net operating revenues generated by our hospitals in Florida, as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, were 14.3% in 2018, 14.0% in 2017 and 13.6% in 2016. Net operating revenues generated by our hospitals in Texas, as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, were 11.7% in 2018, 10.9% in 2017 and 10.4% in 2016. Net operating revenues generated by our hospitals in Indiana, as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, were 12.5% in 2018, 11.6% in 2017 and 9.4% in 2016. 
 Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for hospital services provided. Charges and payment rates for routine inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of service performed and the geographic location of the hospital. In recent years, we have experienced a significant increase in revenue received from outpatient services. We attribute this increase to: 
 

 | advances in technology, which have permitted us to provide more services on an outpatient basis and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pressure from Medicare and Medicaid programs, insurance companies and managed care plans to reduce the length and number of inpatient hospital stays and to reduce costs by having services provided on an outpatient rather than on an inpatient basis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Healthcare facility operations are also subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient utilization during holiday periods and increases in colder weather months. 
 Government Regulation 
 Overview. The healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions, our hospitals could lose their licenses and we could lose our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs. Hospitals must meet requirements to be certified as hospitals and qualified to participate in government programs, including those relating to the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures; billing and coding for services; properly handling overpayments; classifications of levels of care provided; preparing and filing of cost reports; relationships with referral sources and referral recipients; maintenance of adequate records; hospital use; rate-setting; building codes; environmental protection; and privacy and security. 
 Hospitals are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities to determine their compliance with applicable regulations and requirements necessary for licensing and certification. All of our hospitals are licensed under appropriate state laws and are qualified to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, most of our hospitals are accredited by The Joint Commission. This accreditation indicates that a hospital satisfies the applicable health and administrative standards to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Government regulations may change. If that happens, we may have to make changes to our facilities, equipment, personnel and services so that our hospitals remain certified as hospitals and qualified to participate in these programs. We believe that our hospitals are in substantial compliance with current federal, state and 
 
13 
 
 local regulations and standards. We cannot be certain that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws or whistleblowers will not assert that we are in violation of them or that such statutes or regulations will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with our interpretation. 
 Healthcare Reform. Over the last decade, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes intended to increase access to health insurance. The most prominent of these efforts, the Affordable Care Act, affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed, but its future is uncertain. The law has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges, and the presidential administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make additional significant changes to, the Affordable Care Act, its implementation or its interpretation. For example, the Affordable Care Act mandates that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain health insurance coverage and increases health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. However, as part of the tax reform legislation which was enacted in December 2017, effective January 1, 2019, the financial penalty for individuals that fail to maintain health insurance coverage associated with the individual mandate was eliminated. Additionally, final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. These changes may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. In December 2018, a federal judge in Texas found the entire Affordable Care Act to be unconstitutional, as a result of the elimination of the individual mandate penalty as noted above. Pending the appeal process, the law remains in place. 
 We believe that the Affordable Care Act has had a positive impact on net operating revenues and income from continuing operations as the result of the expansion of private sector and Medicaid coverage that has occurred. However, other provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as requirements related to employee health insurance coverage, have increased our operating costs. In addition, the Affordable Care Act has made changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement that could adversely impact the reimbursement we receive under these programs. These changes include reductions to the Medicare annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the Medicare market basket update, and reductions to the Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments. 
 Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing net effect of the Affordable Care Act due to the possibility of repeal or significant additional changes to the law, clarifications and modifications resulting from executive orders, the rule-making process, the ultimate outcome of court challenges and the development of agency guidance, whether and how many states ultimately decide to expand Medicaid coverage and on what terms, the number of individuals who elect to purchase health insurance coverage and budgetary issues at federal and state levels. The impact on the healthcare industry and timing of any potential repeal of or further changes to the Affordable Care Act and any alternative provisions is unknown. For example, members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including single-payor proposals, which could also significantly affect healthcare providers. It is difficult to predict the nature and success of future financial or delivery system reforms. 
 Fraud and Abuse Laws. Participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs is heavily regulated by federal statute and regulation. If a hospital fails to comply substantially with the requirements for participating in the programs, the hospitals participation may be terminated and/or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed. For example, a hospital may lose its ability to participate in the Medicare program if it engages in any of the following acts: 

 | making claims to Medicare for services not provided or misrepresenting actual services provided in order to obtain higher payments;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
14 
 

 | paying money to induce the referral of patients where services are reimbursable under a federal health program; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | paying money to limit or reduce the services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Any person or entity that knowingly and willfully defrauds or attempts to defraud a healthcare benefit program, including private healthcare plans, may be subject to fines, imprisonment or both. Additionally, any person or entity that knowingly and willfully falsifies or conceals a material fact or makes any material false or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery or payment of healthcare services by a healthcare benefit plan is subject to a fine, imprisonment or both. 
 A section of the Social Security Act, known as the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits some business practices and relationships under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. These practices include the payment, receipt, offer, or solicitation of remuneration of any kind in exchange for items or services that are reimbursed under most federal or state healthcare programs. 
 The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, is responsible for identifying and investigating fraud and abuse activities in federal healthcare programs. As part of its duties, the OIG provides guidance to healthcare providers by identifying types of activities that could violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. The OIG also publishes regulations outlining activities and business relationships that would be deemed not to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. These regulations are known as safe harbor regulations. The failure of a particular activity to comply with the safe harbor regulations does not necessarily mean that the activity violates the Anti-Kickback Statute; however, such failure may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. 
 The OIG has identified the following incentive arrangements as potential violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute: 
 

 | payment of any incentive by the hospital when a physician refers a patient to the hospital;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment for physicians in facilities usually located close to the hospital;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing, or other staff services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | free training for a physicians office staff, including management and laboratory techniques (but excluding compliance training);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | guarantees which provide that, if the physicians income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the remainder;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | payment of the costs of a physicians travel and expenses for conferences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | payment of services which require few, if any, substantive duties by the physician, or payment for services in excess of the fair market value of the services rendered;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | coverage on the hospitals group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | rental of space in physician offices, at other than fair market value; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
15 
 

 | physician-owned entities (often referred to as physician-owned distributorships, or PODS) that derive revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of, implantable medical devices ordered by their physician-owners for use on procedures that physician-owners perform on their own patients at hospitals or ASCs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals. Physicians own interests in a number of our facilities. Physicians may also own our stock. We also have contracts with physicians providing for a variety of financial arrangements, including employment contracts, leases, management agreements and professional service agreements. We provide financial incentives to recruit physicians to relocate to communities served by our hospitals. These incentives include relocation, reimbursement for certain direct expenses, income guarantees and, in some cases, loans. Although we strive to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, taking into account available guidance including the safe harbor regulations, we cannot assure you that regulatory authorities will not determine otherwise. If that happens, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and/or exclusion from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, or other government healthcare programs. Civil monetary penalties are increased annually based on updates to the consumer price index and were increased under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. 
 The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the Stark Law. This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to healthcare entities in which they or any of their immediate family members have ownership interests or other financial arrangements. These types of referrals are commonly known as self referrals. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties that are increased annually based on updates to the consumer price index, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. 
 There are ownership and compensation arrangement exceptions to the self-referral prohibition. One exception, known as the whole hospital exception, allows a physician to make a referral to a hospital if the physician owns an interest in the entire hospital, as opposed to an ownership interest in a department of the hospital. Another exception allows a physician to refer patients to a healthcare entity in which the physician has an ownership interest if the entity is located in a rural area, as defined in the statute. There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. From time to time, the federal government has issued regulations that interpret the provisions included in the Stark Law. 
 The Affordable Care Act narrowed the whole hospital exception to the Stark Law. The Affordable Care Act permitted existing physician investments in a whole hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited, from the time the Affordable Care Act became effective, from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital. The Affordable Care Act also restricts the ability of existing physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their aggregate licensed beds, operating rooms and procedure rooms. The whole hospital exception also contains additional public disclosure requirements. 
 In addition to the restrictions and disclosure requirements applicable to physician-owned hospitals under the Stark Law, CMS regulations require physician-owned hospitals and their physician owners to disclose certain ownership information to patients. Physician-owned hospitals must disclose their physician ownership in writing to patients and must make a list of their physician owners available upon request. Additionally, each physician owner who is a member of a physician-owned hospitals medical staff must agree, as a condition of continued medical staff membership or admitting privileges, to disclose in writing to all patients whom they refer to the hospital their (or an immediate family members) ownership interest in the hospital. A hospital is considered to be physician-owned if any physician, or an immediate family member of a physician, holds debt, stock or other types of investment in the hospital or in any owner of the hospital, excluding physician ownership through publicly-traded securities that meet certain conditions. If a hospital fails to comply with these regulations, the hospital could lose its Medicare provider agreement and be unable to participate in Medicare. 
 
16 
 
Evolving interpretations of current, or the adoption of new, federal or state laws or regulations could affect many of the arrangements entered into by each of our hospitals. In addition, law enforcement authorities, including the OIG, the courts and Congress have in recent years increased scrutiny of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to improperly pay for patient referrals and/or other business. Investigators also have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources. 
 Many states in which we operate have also adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or that otherwise prohibit fraud and abuse activities. Many states have also passed self-referral legislation similar to the Stark Law, prohibiting the referral of patients to entities with which the physician has a financial relationship. Often these state laws are broad in scope and may apply regardless of the source of payment for care. These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of licensure. Little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws. 
 Our operations could be adversely affected by the failure of our arrangements to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, billing laws and regulations, current state laws or other legislation or regulations in these areas adopted in the future. We are unable to predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level in any of these areas will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or how they may affect our operations. We are continuing to enter into new financial arrangements with physicians and other providers in a manner structured to comply in all material respects with these laws. We strive to comply with applicable fraud and abuse laws. We cannot assure you, however, that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws or whistleblowers will not assert that we are in violation of them or that such statutes or regulations ultimately will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with our interpretation. 
 Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws. Another significant enforcement mechanism used within the healthcare industry is the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, which can be used to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud involving issues such as coding errors, billing for service not provided and submitting false cost reports. Further, the FCA covers payments involving federal funds in connection with the health insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, if those payments involve any federal funds. Liability under the FCA often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA broadly defines the term knowingly. Although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity may constitute knowingly submitting a false claim and result in liability. Among the many other potential bases for liability under the FCA is the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government within 60 days of identifying an overpayment. An overpayment is deemed to be identified when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment. Submission of a claim for an item or service generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. In some cases, whistleblowers, the federal government and courts have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. 
 When a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the defendant must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus substantial civil penalties for each separate false claim. These civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. Settlements entered into prior to litigation usually involve a less severe calculation of damages. The FCA also contains qui tam, or whistleblower provisions, which allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. If the government intervenes in the action and prevails, the party filing the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment. If the government does not intervene in the action, the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently and may receive a larger share of any settlement or judgment. When a private party brings a qui tam action under the 
 
17 
 
 FCA, the defendant generally will not be made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or determines whether it will intervene. Every entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors and agents providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. 
 A number of states, including states in which we operate, have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. Federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws that are comparable to the FCA. From time to time, companies in the healthcare industry, including ours, may be subject to actions under the FCA or similar state laws. 
 Corporate Practice of Medicine; Fee-Splitting. Some states have laws that prohibit unlicensed persons or business entities, including corporations, from employing physicians. Some states also have adopted laws that prohibit direct or indirect payments to, or entering into fee-splitting arrangements with, physicians and unlicensed persons or business entities. Possible sanctions for violations of these restrictions include loss of a physicians license, civil and criminal penalties and rescission of business arrangements. These laws vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. We structure our arrangements with healthcare providers to comply with the relevant state law. However, we cannot provide assurance that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws will not assert that we, or transactions in which we are involved, are in violation of these laws. These laws may also be interpreted by the courts in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations. 
 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act imposes requirements as to the care that must be provided to anyone who comes to facilities providing emergency medical services seeking care before they may be transferred to another facility or otherwise denied care. Sanctions for failing to fulfill these requirements include exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs and civil money penalties, which are increased annually based on updates to the consumer price index. In addition, the law creates private civil remedies that enable an individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a violation of the law to sue the offending hospital for damages and equitable relief. A medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another participating hospitals violation of the law also has a similar right. Although we believe that our practices are in compliance with the law, we can give no assurance that governmental officials responsible for enforcing the law will not assert we are in violation of this law. 
 Conversion Legislation. Many states, including some where we have hospitals and others where we may in the future acquire hospitals, have adopted legislation regarding the sale or other disposition of hospitals operated by not-for-profit entities. In other states that do not have specific legislation, the attorneys general have demonstrated an interest in these transactions under their general obligations to protect charitable assets from waste. These legislative and administrative efforts primarily focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the not-for-profit seller. While these reviews and, in some instances, approval processes can add additional time to the closing of a hospital acquisition, we have not had any significant difficulties or delays in completing the process. There can be no assurance, however, that future actions on the state level will not seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals. If these activities are widespread, they could limit our ability to acquire hospitals. 
 Certificates of Need. The construction of new facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, significant capital expenditures and the addition of new services at our facilities may be subject to state laws that require prior approval by state regulatory agencies. These CON laws generally require that a state agency determine the public need and give approval prior to the construction or acquisition of facilities, significant capital expenditure or the addition of new services. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 79 hospitals in 15 states that have adopted CON laws for acute care facilities. If we fail to obtain necessary state approval, we will not be able to expand our 
 
18 
 
 facilities, complete acquisitions or significant capital expenditures or add new services in these states. Violation of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of a hospitals licenses. 
 HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, requires the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. HHS has established electronic data transmission standards and code sets that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically. In addition, HIPAA requires that each provider use a National Provider Identifier. The Affordable Care Act requires the HHS to adopt standards for additional electronic transactions and to establish operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. 
 As required by HIPAA, HHS has issued privacy and security regulations that extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health-related information and require covered entities, including health plans and most healthcare providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is electronically maintained or transmitted. Business associates (entities that handle identifiable health-related information on behalf of covered entities) are subject to direct liability for violation of applicable provisions of the regulations. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. We have developed and utilize a HIPAA compliance plan as part of our effort to comply with HIPAA privacy and security requirements. The privacy regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on us in order to comply with these standards. 
 Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by the covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information. 
 Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties per violation. The civil penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. HHS is required to perform compliance audits. In addition to enforcement by HHS, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. HHS may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but HHS has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. Our facilities also are subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. 
 Payment 
 Medicare. Under the Medicare program, we are paid for inpatient and outpatient services performed by our hospitals. 
 Payments for inpatient acute services are generally made pursuant to a prospective payment system, commonly known as PPS. Under PPS, our hospitals are paid a predetermined amount for each hospital discharge based on the patients diagnosis. Specifically, each discharge is assigned to a diagnosis-related group, 
 
19 
 
 commonly known as a DRG, based upon the patients condition and treatment during the relevant inpatient stay. Each DRG is assigned a payment rate using 100% of the national average cost per case and 100% of the severity-adjusted DRG weights. DRG payments are based on national averages and not on charges or costs specific to a hospital. Severity-adjusted DRGs more accurately reflect the costs a hospital incurs for caring for a patient and account more fully for the severity of each patients condition. However, DRG payments are adjusted by a predetermined geographic adjustment factor assigned to the geographic area in which the hospital is located. While a hospital generally does not receive payment in addition to a DRG payment, hospitals may qualify for an outlier payment when the relevant patients treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified regulatory threshold. 
 The DRG payment rates are adjusted by an update factor on October 1 of each year, the beginning of the federal fiscal year. The index used to adjust the DRG payment rates, known as the market basket index, gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. DRG payment rates were increased by the market basket index update of 2.7% and 2.9% for each of federal fiscal years 2018 and 2019, respectively, subject to certain reductions. For federal fiscal year 2018, the market basket update was positively adjusted by 0.46% in accordance with the 21st Century Cures Act, and reduced by 0.6% for the multi-factor productivity adjustment, reduced 0.75% in accordance with the Affordable Care Act, and reduced by 0.6% to remove the effects of prior adjustments related to the two midnight rule. For federal fiscal year 2019, the market basket update was positively adjusted by 0.5% in accordance with MACRA, and reduced 0.8% for the multi-factor productively adjustment, and reduced 0.75% in accordance with the Affordable Care Act. A 25% reduction to the market basket index occurs if patient quality data is not submitted, and a reduction of 75% of the market basket index update occurs for hospitals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health records, or EHR, technology without receiving a hardship exception. Future legislation may decrease the rate of increase for DRG payments or even decrease such payment rates, but we are unable to predict the amount of any reduction or the effect that any reduction will have on us. 
 The DRG payment rates are also adjusted to promote value-based purchasing, linking payments to quality and efficiency. First, hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under CMSs value-based purchasing program, while hospitals that do not satisfy certain quality performance standards will receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. The amount collected from the reductions is pooled and used to fund the payments that reward hospitals based on a set of quality measures that have been linked to improved clinical processes of care and patient satisfaction. CMS scores each hospital on its achievement relative to other hospitals and improvement relative to that hospitals own past performance. Second, hospitals experiencing excess readmissions for conditions designated by CMS within 30 days from the patients date of discharge will receive inpatient payments reduced by an amount determined by comparing that hospitals readmission performance to a risk-adjusted national average. Third, the 25% of hospitals with the worst national risk-adjusted hospital acquired condition, or HAC, rates in the previous year will have their total inpatient operating Medicare payments reduced by 1%. HHS has indicated that it will increase its efforts to promote, develop and use alternative payment models such as Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs, and bundled payment arrangements. 
 In addition, hospitals may qualify for Medicare disproportionate share payments when their percentage of low income patients exceeds specified regulatory thresholds. A majority of our hospitals qualify to receive Medicare disproportionate share payments. CMS also distributes a prospectively determined amount to Medicare disproportionate share hospitals based on a hospitals relative share of uncompensated care. These uncompensated care payments are drawn from pool that is funded by the 75% reduction in disproportionate share payments that was made pursuant to the Affordable Care Act. The uncompensated care pool is further reduced each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the U.S. uninsured population that is under 65 years of age. Thus, the greater the level of coverage for the uninsured, the more the Medicare uncompensated care pool will be reduced. Each eligible hospital is paid, out of the uncompensated care pool, an amount based upon its estimated cost of providing uncompensated care. These Medicare disproportionate share and uncompensated care payments as a percentage of net operating revenues was 1.27% and 1.16% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 
 
20 
 
 2017, respectively. Hospitals may also qualify for Medicaid disproportionate share payments when they qualify under the state established guidelines. These Medicaid disproportionate share payments as a percentage of net operating revenues was 0.52% and 0.46% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Affordable Care Act also provided for reductions to the Medicaid disproportionate share payments, but Congress has delayed the implementation of those reductions until 2020. 
 We also receive Medicare reimbursement for hospital outpatient services through a PPS. Services paid under the hospital outpatient PPS are grouped into ambulatory payment classifications. APC payment rates are generally determined by applying a conversion factor, which CMS updates annually using a market basket. For calendar year 2018, CMS estimated an increase in hospital outpatient PPS payments of 1.4%. This reflects a market basket increase of 2.7%, with a 0.75% downward adjustment in accordance with the Affordable Care Act, a 0.6% downward productivity adjustment, and other policy changes. For calendar year 2019, CMS estimated an increase in hospital outpatient PPS payments of 0.6%. This reflects a market basket increase of 2.9%, with a 0.75% downward adjustment in accordance with the Affordable Care Act, and a 0.8% downward productivity adjustment. An additional 2.0% reduction to the market basket update applies to hospitals that do not submit required patient quality data. We are complying with this data submission requirement. 
 Over the next two years, CMS is imposing a site-neutral payment policy for off-campus provider-based departments paid under the outpatient PPS. Off-campus provider-based departments will be paid the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule-equivalent rate for clinic visits. CMS estimates this will result in a 0.6% reduction to hospital payments, depending on the volume of clinic visits provided at the hospitals off-campus provider-based departments. 
 The Medicare reimbursement discussed above was reduced beginning in 2013 due to the Budget Control Act of 2011 that required across-the-board spending cuts to the federal budget, also known as sequestration. These sequestration cuts included reductions in payments for Medicare and other federally funded healthcare programs, including TRICARE. These reductions have been extended through 2027. 
 Payment under the Medicare program for physician services is based upon the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS, under which CMS has assigned a national relative value unit, or RVU, to most medical procedures and services that reflects the resources required to provide the services relative to all other services. Each RVU is calculated based on a combination of the time and intensity of work required, overhead expense attributable to the service, and malpractice insurance expense. These elements are each modified by a geographic adjustment factor to account for local practice costs and are then aggregated. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 provides for a 0.25% update to the MPFS, which is then reduced by a 0.14% budget neutrality adjustment for an overall estimated increase of 0.11% for calendar year 2019. MACRA requires the establishment of the Quality Payment Program, or QPP, a payment methodology intended to reward high-quality patient care. Beginning in 2017, physicians and certain other healthcare clinicians are required to participate in one of two QPP tracks. Under both tracks, performance data collected each performance year will affect Medicare payments two years later. CMS expects to transition increasing financial risk to providers as QPP evolves. Under the Advanced Alternative Payment Model, or Advanced APM, track, incentive payments are available based on participation in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS. Providers may earn a Medicare incentive payment and will be exempt from the reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS, if the provider has sufficient participation in an Advanced APM. Alternatively, providers may participate in the MIPS track, under which physicians will receive performance-based payment incentives or payment reductions based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities, and meaningful use of EHR. MIPS consolidates components of certain previously established physician incentive programs. 
 Medicaid. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS or under programs which negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid is funded jointly by state and federal government. The federal government and many states are considering various strategies to reduce Medicaid expenditures. Currently, several states utilize supplemental reimbursement programs intended to offset a portion of the costs to providers 
 
21 
 
 associated with providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. These programs are designed with input from CMS and may be funded with a combination of state and federal resources, including, in certain instances, fees or taxes levied on the healthcare providers. Many states currently operate, or have applied to CMS to operate, Medicaid programs under waivers to standard Medicaid program requirements. CMS has indicated that it intends to increase state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs, including allowing states to condition enrollment on work or other community engagement. We can provide no assurance that changes to Medicaid programs or reductions to Medicaid funding will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. 
 TRICARE. TRICARE is the Department of Defenses healthcare program for members of the armed forces. For inpatient services, TRICARE generally reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient PPS. For outpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a PPS that is similar to that utilized for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. 
 Annual Cost Reports. Hospitals participating in the Medicare and some Medicaid programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a PPS, are required to meet specified financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require submission of annual cost reports identifying medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. 
 Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and some Medicaid programs are subject to routine governmental audits. These audits may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. Finalization of these audits often takes several years. Providers can appeal any final determination made in connection with an audit. DRG outlier payments have been and continue to be the subject of CMS audit and adjustment. The OIG is also actively engaged in audits and investigations into alleged abuses of the DRG outlier payment system. 
 Commercial Insurance and Managed Care Companies. Our hospitals provide services to individuals covered by private healthcare insurance or by health plans administered by managed care companies. These payors pay our hospitals or in some cases reimburse their policyholders based upon the hospitals established charges and the coverage provided in the insurance policy. They try to limit the costs of hospital services by negotiating discounts, including PPS, which would reduce payments by commercial insurers or health plans to our hospitals. Commercial insurers and managed care companies also seek to reduce payments to hospitals by establishing payment rules that in effect re-characterize the services ordered by physicians. For example, some payors vigorously review each patients length of stay in the hospital and recharacterize as outpatient all inpatient stays of less than a particular duration (e.g., 24 hours). Reductions in payments for services provided by our hospitals to individuals covered by these payors could adversely affect us. 
 Under the Managed Medicare program, also known as Medicare Part C, or Medicare Advantage, the federal government contracts with private health plans to provide members with Medicare benefits. The plans may choose to offer supplemental benefits and impose higher premiums and cost-sharing obligations. Similarly, managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with private entities to handle program responsibilities like care management and claims adjudication. Enrollment in Managed Medicare and managed Medicaid programs has increased in recent years as the federal and state governments seek to control healthcare costs. 
 Medicare Administrative Contractors. CMS competitively bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, in 12 jurisdictions. Each MAC is geographically assigned and serves both Part A and Part B providers within a given jurisdiction. Chain providers had the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC, and we chose to do so. However, CMS has not converted all of our hospitals to one MAC and currently does not have an established date to accomplish the conversion. CMS periodically re-solicits bids, and the MAC servicing a geographic area can change as a result of the bid competition. MAC transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow. 
 
22 
 
Medicare Integrity. CMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through review of quality concerns and detection of improper payments. Quality Improvement Organizations, or QIOs, for example, are groups of physicians and other healthcare quality experts that work on behalf of CMS to ensure that Medicare pays only for goods and services that are reasonable and necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate setting. Under the Recovery Audit Contractor, or RAC, program, CMS contracts with RACs nationwide to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the Medicare program, as required by statute. RACs review claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity. Compensation for RACs is on a contingency basis and based upon the amount of overpayments and underpayments identified, if any. CMS limits the number of claims that RACs may audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each providers claim denial rate for the previous year. 
 The RAC programs scope also includes Medicaid claims. States may coordinate with Medicaid RACs regarding recoupment of overpayments and refer suspected fraud and abuse to appropriate law enforcement agencies. Under the Medicaid Integrity Program, CMS employs private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity Contractors, or MICs, to perform reviews and post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. MICs are assigned to five geographic jurisdictions. Besides MICs, several other contractors and state Medicaid agencies have increased their review activities. CMS is transitioning some of its other integrity programs to a consolidated model by engaging Unified Program Integrity Contractors, or UPICs, to perform audits, investigations and other integrity activities. 
 We maintain policies and procedures to respond to the RAC requests and payment denials. Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews and denials are appealable, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. Currently, there are significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges. According to the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals, the average processing time in fiscal year 2017 was approximately three years. HHS has finalized rules intended to streamline the process and improve efficiency but has also stressed the need for additional funding. Thus, we may experience significant delays in appealing any RAC payment denials. To ease the backlog of appeals, CMS has announced two new settlement initiatives. Depending upon the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims in future periods, our cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted. 
 Accountable Care Organizations. With the aim of reducing healthcare costs by improving quality and operational efficiency, ACOs are gaining traction in both the public and private sectors. An ACO is a network of providers and suppliers (including hospitals, physicians and other designated professionals) which work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. Pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, HHS established a Medicare Shared Savings Program that seeks to promote accountability and coordination of care through the creation of ACOs. Medicare-approved ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. HHS has significant discretion to determine key elements of ACO programs. Certain waivers are available from fraud and abuse laws for ACOs. 
 Bundled Payment Initiatives. The CMS Innovation Center is responsible for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for healthcare that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while maintaining or improving quality of care. For example, providers participating in bundled payment initiatives accept accountability for costs and quality of care by agreeing to receive one payment for services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical conditions or episodes of care. By rewarding providers for increasing quality and reducing costs and penalizing providers if costs exceed a certain amount, bundled payment models are intended to lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. The CMS Innovation Center has implemented a voluntary bundled payment program known as the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement, or BPCI, initiative. We are participating in BPCI initiatives in ten of our markets. 
 
23 
 
 Participation in bundled payment programs is generally voluntary, but CMS requires hospitals located in certain geographic areas to participate in bundling programs for specified orthopedic procedures. CMS has indicated that it is developing more bundled payment models. We expect value-based purchasing programs, including models that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common with both governmental and non-governmental payors. 
 Supply Contracts 
 We purchase items, primarily medical supplies, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, under an agreement with HealthTrust, a GPO in which we are a noncontrolling partner. As of December 31, 2018, we had a 17.7% ownership interest in HealthTrust. By participating in this organization, we are able to procure items at competitively priced rates for our hospitals. There can be no assurance that our arrangement with HealthTrust will continue to provide the discounts that we have historically received. 
Competition 
 The hospital industry is highly competitive. The competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified as patients have become more conscious of rising costs and quality of care in the healthcare decision-making process. Certain of our hospitals are located in non-urban service areas in which we are the sole provider of general acute care health services. Those hospitals in non-urban service areas face no direct competition because there are no other hospitals in their primary service areas. However, these hospitals face competition from hospitals outside of their primary service area, including hospitals in urban areas that provide more complex services. Patients in those service areas may travel to these other hospitals for a variety of reasons, including the need for services we do not offer, payor networks that exclude our providers, or physician referrals. Patients who are required to seek services from these other hospitals may subsequently shift their preferences to those hospitals for services we do provide. Our other hospitals in selected urban service areas may face competition from hospitals that are more established than our hospitals. Certain of these competing facilities offer services, including extensive medical research and medical education programs, which are not offered by our facilities. In addition, in certain markets where we operate, there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services that may not be available at our hospitals. We also face competition from other specialized care providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers. Some competitors are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups, and participating in ACOs, or other clinical integration models. Cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates may increase this competition. We believe that we will continue to face increased competition in outpatient service models that become more integrated through acquisitions or partnerships between physicians, specialized care providers, and managed care payors. 
 In most markets in which we are not the sole provider of general acute care health services, our primary competitor is a not-for-profit hospital. These hospitals are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions. These hospitals do not pay income or property taxes, and can make capital expenditures without paying sales tax. These financial advantages may better position such hospitals to maintain more modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment and offer services more specialized than those available at our hospitals. Recent consolidations of not-for-profit hospitals may intensify competitive pressures. 
 The number and quality of the physicians on a hospitals staff is an important factor in a hospitals competitive position. Physicians decide whether a patient is admitted to the hospital and the procedures to be performed. Admitting physicians may be on the medical staffs of other hospitals in addition to those of our hospitals. We attempt to attract our physicians patients to our hospitals by offering quality services and facilities, convenient locations and state-of-the-art equipment. In addition, CMS publicizes on its Hospital Compare website data that hospitals submit in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, including performance data related to quality measures and patient satisfaction surveys. Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. Additional quality measures and other future trends toward clinical 
 
24 
 
 transparency may have a potential impact on our competitive position and patient volumes in ways that we are unable to predict. In addition, hospitals must publish online a list of their standard charges for items and services. 
 Compliance Program 
 We take an operations team approach to compliance and utilize corporate experts for program design efforts and facility leaders for employee-level implementation. We believe compliance is another area that demonstrates our utilization of standardization and centralization techniques and initiatives which yield efficiencies and consistency throughout our facilities. We recognize that our compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends on individual employee actions as well as company operations. Our approach focuses on integrating compliance responsibilities with operational functions. This approach is intended to reinforce our company-wide commitment to operate strictly in accordance with the laws and regulations that govern our business. 
 Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1997. Currently, the programs elements include leadership, management and oversight at the highest levels, a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs and a means for enforcing the programs policies. 
 The compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industrys expectations and our needs. Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities, have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business. Included within these functional areas are materials and activities for business sub-units, including laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, emergency, surgery, observation, home care, skilled nursing and clinics. Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program. Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas. Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with the federal anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, emergency department treatment and transfer requirements and other patient disposition issues, are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements and review and audit. Another focus of the program is the interpretation and implementation of the HIPAA standards for privacy and security. 
 We have a Code of Conduct which applies to all directors, officers, employees and consultants, and a confidential disclosure program to enhance the statement of ethical responsibility expected of our employees and business associates who work in the accounting, financial reporting and asset management areas of our Company. Our Code of Conduct is posted on our website at www.chs.net/company-overview/code-of-conduct.
Corporate Integrity Agreement 
 On August 4, 2014, we announced that we had entered into a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, other federal agencies and identified relators that concluded previously announced investigations and litigation related to short stay admissions through emergency departments at certain of our affiliated hospitals. See the Legal Proceedings discussion in Part II, Item 1 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2014 for further discussion of the background of this matter and details of the settlement. In addition to the amounts paid in the settlement, we executed a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement, or CIA, with the OIG that has been incorporated into our existing and comprehensive compliance program. 
 On September 25, 2018, we announced a global resolution and settlement agreements ending the U.S. Department of Justice investigation into certain conduct of HMA and its affiliated entities and settling certain qui tam lawsuits that were initiated and pending, and known to us, before our acquisition by merger of HMA in 2014. Under this settlement, we made payments totaling $266 million, including interest, in the fourth quarter of 2018. See the Legal Proceedings discussion in Part II, Item 1 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2018 and the press release filed therewith on September 25, 2018 for 
 
25 
 
 further discussion of this matter and the details of the settlement. Additionally, under the terms of the global settlement, our existing CIA has been amended and extended. The extension began immediately and effectively adds two years to the existing CIA, with the amended CIA now running through 2021. 
 The compliance measures and reporting and auditing requirements contained in the CIA include: 
 

 | continuing the duties and activities of our Corporate Compliance Officer, Corporate Compliance Work Group, and Facility Compliance Officers and committees;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | maintaining our written Code of Conduct, which sets forth our commitment to full compliance with all statutes, regulations, and guidelines applicable to federal healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | maintaining our written policies and procedures addressing the operation of our Compliance Program, including adherence to medical necessity and admissions standards for inpatient hospital stays;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | continuing our general compliance training;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | providing specific training for appropriate personnel on billing, case management and clinical documentation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | engaging an independent third party to perform an annual review of our compliance with the CIA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | continuing our Confidential Disclosure Program and hotline to enable employees or others to disclose issues or questions regarding possible inappropriate policies or behavior;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | maintaining our screening program to ensure that we do not hire or engage employees or contractors who are ineligible persons for federal healthcare programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | notifying the OIG of any government investigations;
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | reporting any material deficiency which resulted in an overpayment to us by a federal healthcare program; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submitting annual reports to the OIG which describe in detail the operations of our corporate Compliance Program for the past year.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Material, uncorrected violations of the CIA could lead to our suspension or disbarment from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs and repayment obligations. In addition, we are subject to possible civil penalties for failure to substantially comply with the terms of the CIA, including stipulated penalties ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 per day. We are also subject to a stipulated penalty of $50,000 for each false certification made by us or on our behalf in connection with reports required under the CIA. The CIA increases the amount of information we must provide to the federal government regarding our healthcare practices and our compliance with federal regulations. The reports we provide in connection with the CIA could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory authorities. We believe our existing Compliance Program addresses compliance with the operational terms of the CIA. 
 Employees and Medical Staff 
 At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 87,000 employees, including approximately 17,000 part-time employees. References herein to employees refer to employees of our affiliates. We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. At December 31, 2018, certain employees at ten of our hospitals are represented by various labor unions. It is likely that union organizing efforts will take place at additional hospitals in the future. We consider our employee relations to be good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely affected our 
 
26 
 
 business or results of operations. Our hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced rising labor costs. In some markets, nurse and medical support personnel availability has become a significant operating issue to healthcare providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity. 
 Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospitals medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time. 
 We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Certain proposed changes in federal labor laws and the National Labor Relations Boards pending modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase significantly. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios. 
 Professional Liability Claims 
 As part of our business of owning and operating hospitals, we are subject to legal actions alleging liability on our part. To cover claims arising out of the operations of hospitals, we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance on a claims made basis in excess of those amounts for which we are self-insured, in amounts we believe to be sufficient for our operations. We also maintain umbrella liability coverage for claims which, due to their nature or amount, are not covered by our other insurance policies. However, our insurance coverage does not cover all claims against us or may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance. For a further discussion of our insurance coverage, see our discussion of professional liability claims in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, including medical and pharmaceutical waste products. We do not currently expect compliance with these laws and regulations to have a material adverse effect on us. It is possible, however, that environmental issues may arise in the future which we cannot now predict. 
 We are insured for damages of personal property or environmental injury arising out of environmental impairment for both above ground and underground storage tank issues under one insurance policy for all of our hospitals. Our policy coverage is $5 million per occurrence with a $100,000 deductible and a $20 million annual aggregate. This policy also provides pollution legal liability coverage.
