 Item 1. Business.
 Who We Are
 We are a diversified property/casualty insurance group that serves businesses and individuals in specialty and niche markets.
 We offer specialty commercial insurance, standard commercial insurance and personal insurance in selected market subcategories that are characteristically low-severity and predominately short-tailed risks. We focus on marketing, distributing, underwriting and servicing property/casualty insurance products that require specialized underwriting expertise or market knowledge. We believe this approach provides us the best opportunity to achieve favorable policy terms and pricing. The insurance policies we produce are written by our six insurance company subsidiaries as well as unaffiliated insurers.
 We market, distribute, underwrite and service our property/casualty insurance products primarily through subsidiaries whose operations are organized into product-specific operating units that are supported by our insurance company subsidiaries. Our Contract Binding operating unit offers commercial insurance products and services in the excess and surplus lines market. Our Specialty Commercial operating unit offers general aviation and satellite launch insurance products and services, low and middle market commercial umbrella and primary/excess liability insurance, medical professional liability insurance products and services, financial professional liability insurance products and services and primary/excess commercial property coverages for both catastrophe and non-catastrophe exposures. Our Standard Commercial P&C operating unit offers industry-specific commercial insurance products and services in the standard market. Our Workers Compensation operating unit specializes in small and middle market workers compensation business. Effective July 1, 2015, the Workers Compensation operating unit ceased marketing or retaining any risk on new or renewal policies. Our Specialty Personal Lines operating unit offers non-standard personal automobile and renters insurance products and services.
 Each operating unit has its own management team with significant experience in distributing products to its target markets and proven success in achieving underwriting profitability. Each operating unit is responsible for marketing, distribution and underwriting while we provide capital management, claims management, reinsurance, actuarial, investment, financial reporting, technology and legal services and other administrative support at the parent level. We believe this approach optimizes our operating results by allowing us to effectively penetrate our selected specialty and niche markets while maintaining operational controls, managing risks, controlling overhead and efficiently allocating our capital across operating units. We expect future growth to be derived from organic growth in the premium production of our existing operating units and selected opportunistic acquisitions that meet our criteria.
 What We Do
 We market commercial and personal lines property/casualty insurance products which are tailored to the risks and coverages required by the insured. We believe that most of our target markets are underserved by larger property/casualty insurers because of the specialized nature of the underwriting required. We are able to offer these products profitably as a result of the expertise of our experienced underwriters. We also believe our long-standing relationships with independent general agencies and retail agents and the service we provide differentiate us from larger property/casualty insurers.
 Our Contract Binding operating unit primarily offers commercial property/casualty insurance products in the excess and surplus lines market. Excess and surplus lines insurance provides coverage for difficult to place risks that do not fit the underwriting criteria of insurers operating in the standard market. Our Contract Binding operating unit focuses on middle market commercial risks that do not meet the underwriting requirements of standard insurers due to factors such as loss history, number of years in business, minimum premium size and types of business operation. Our Contract Binding operating unit primarily writes commercial automobile, general liability, commercial property and excess casualty

coverages. Our Contract Binding operating unit markets its products in 37 states through 11 wholesale brokers and 114 general agency offices, as well as 27 independent retail agents in Texas. 
 Our Specialty Commercial operating unit offers small and middle market commercial excess liability, umbrella, general liability and public entity excess liability insurance on both an admitted and non-admitted basis; general aviation property/casualty insurance primarily for private and small commercial aircraft and airports; satellite launch property/casualty insurance products;  medical and financial professional liability insurance on an excess and surplus lines basis; and primary/excess commercial property coverages on an excess and surplus lines basis for both catastrophe and non-catastrophe exposures. The principal focus of the excess and umbrella insurance products offered is transportation (trucking for hire and specialty automobile coverage). The Specialty Commercial operating unit also provides excess liability coverage for small to midsize businesses in class categories such as contracting, manufacturing, hospitality and service (non-transportation). Typical risks range from one power unit to fleets of up to 1000 power units and up to $150 million in receipts (non-construction) or $200 million in receipts (construction) from operations. Public entity excess coverage is also offered on an insurance and reinsurance basis for cities, counties and other public entities with populations up to 1,000,000. Our Specialty Commercial operating unit markets these excess and umbrella products through 124 wholesale brokers in all 50 states.

 The medical professional liability insurance is underwritten on an excess and surplus lines basis by our Specialty Commercial operating unit and focuses on physicians, mid-level providers, miscellaneous medical facilities, hospitals and healthcare organizations and senior care/nursing homes.  The physicians and mid-level providers are generally hard to place or non-standard risks.  These are individuals who do not meet the underwriting requirements of standard insurers due to factors such as loss history, number of years in business, minimum premium size and types of business operation. In addition to healthcare professionals, our Specialty Commercial operating unit also underwrites medical professional liability for standard medical facilities, hospitals and healthcare systems and senior care/nursing homes. The medical facilities are generally outpatient facilities such as surgery centers, imaging centers, labs, home health agencies and other non-hospital facilities providing medical services. The hospitals and healthcare systems are generally stand-alone acute care facilities, multi-hospital systems, integrated delivery systems, critical access hospitals and others specialty hospitals and healthcare systems providing medical services.  Our Specialty Commercial operating unit markets these products through 34 wholesale and retail brokers in 49 states. The Specialty Commercial operating unit also provides medical professional liability to senior care facilities through a program where a managing general agent underwrites on our behalf risks that meet specific underwriting criteria. The financial professional liability insurance underwritten on an excess and surplus lines basis by our Specialty Commercial operating unit focuses on management and professional liability products that include directors & officers, employment practices and retirement and benefit plan fiduciary services for private, public and non-profit entities as well as miscellaneous professional liability insurance for most non-financial institution service industries. Our Specialty Commercial operating unit distributes its financial professional liability insurance products through 30 wholesale brokers in 49 states. The primary/excess commercial property coverages underwritten by our Specialty Commercial operating unit specialize in shared and layered accounts on a non-admitted basis which target regional and national property programs. Our Specialty Commercial operating unit markets these products through 22 wholesale brokers in 50 states.
 Our Standard Commercial P&C operating unit primarily underwrites low-severity, short-tailed commercial property/casualty insurance products in the standard market.

 Our Specialty Personal Lines operating unit primarily offers non-standard personal automobile policies, which generally provide the minimum limits of liability coverage mandated by state law to drivers who find it difficult to obtain insurance from standard carriers due to various factors including age, driving record, claims history or limited financial resources. Our Specialty Personal Lines operating unit also provides a renters insurance product that complements our non-standard auto offering and fits well in our distribution channel. Our Specialty Personal Lines operating unit markets and services these non-standard auto and renters insurance policies through 4,305 independent retail agent locations in 10 and 12 states, respectively.
 Our insurance company subsidiaries are American Hallmark Insurance Company of Texas (“AHIC”), Hallmark Insurance Company (“HIC”), Hallmark Specialty Insurance Company (“HSIC”), Hallmark County Mutual Insurance Company (“HCM”), Hallmark National Insurance Company (“HNIC”) and Texas Builders Insurance Company (“TBIC”).

from collision and various other perils. In addition, many states require policies to provide for first party personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Renters. Renters insurance provides coverage for the contents of a renter’s home or apartment and for liability. Renter’s policies are similar to homeowners insurance, except they do not cover the structure.

  Our Specialty Personal Lines operating unit markets its products through 4,305 independent retail agent locations operating in its target geographic markets. Non-standard automobile represented 96% of the premiums produced during 2018. Our Specialty Personal Lines operating unit qualifies new agent appointments in order to establish an efficient network of independent agents to effectively penetrate its highly competitive markets. Our Specialty Personal Lines operating unit periodically evaluates its independent agents and discontinues the appointment of agents whose production history does not satisfy certain standards. During 2018, the top ten independent agency locations produced 36%, and no individual agency location produced more than 6%, of the total premium volume of our Specialty Personal Lines operating unit.
 During 2018, personal automobile liability coverage accounted for 72% and personal automobile physical damage coverage accounted for the remaining 28% of the total non-standard automobile premiums produced by our Specialty Personal Lines operating unit. Our most common policy term is a six month policy. We offer additional terms of one-month policies on a limited basis. Our typical non-standard personal automobile customer is unable or unwilling to pay a full or half year premium in advance. Accordingly, we currently offer a direct bill program where the premiums are directly billed to the insured on a monthly basis. We charge installment fees for each payment under the direct bill program. 
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that we enjoy the following competitive strengths:

· | Specialized market knowledge and underwriting expertise. All of our operating units possess extensive knowledge of the specialty and niche markets in which they operate, which we believe allows them to effectively structure and market their property/casualty insurance products. Our Contract Binding operating unit and Specialty Commercial operating unit have developed specialized underwriting expertise which enhances their ability to profitably underwrite non-standard property/casualty insurance coverages. Our Standard Commercial P&C operating unit has significant underwriting experience in its target market for standard commercial property/casualty insurance products. In addition, our Specialty Personal Lines operating unit has a thorough understanding of the unique characteristics of the non-standard personal automobile market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Tailored market strategies. Each of our operating units has developed its own customized strategy for penetrating the specialty or niche markets in which it operates. These strategies include distinctive product structuring, marketing, distribution, underwriting and servicing approaches by each operating unit. As a result, we are able to structure our property/casualty insurance products to serve the unique risk and coverage needs of our insureds. We believe these market-specific strategies enable us to provide policies tailored to the target customer that are appropriately priced and fit our risk profile.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Superior agent and customer service. We believe performing the underwriting, billing, customer service and claims management functions tailored to the needs of each operating unit allows us to provide superior service to both our independent agents and insured customers. The easy-to-use interfaces and responsiveness of our operating units enhance their relationships with the independent agents who sell our policies. We also believe our consistency in offering our insurance products through hard and soft markets helps to build and maintain the loyalty of our independent agents. Our customized products, flexible payment plans and prompt claims processing are similarly beneficial to our insureds.

· | Market diversification. We believe operating in various specialty and niche segments of the property/casualty insurance market diversifies both our revenues and our risks. We also believe our operating units generally operate on different market cycles, producing more earnings stability than if we focused entirely on one product. As a result of the pooling arrangement among four of our insurance company subsidiaries, we are able to

  11

 

efficiently allocate our capital among these various specialty and niche markets in response to market conditions and expansion opportunities. We believe this market diversification reduces our risk profile and enhances our profitability.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Experienced management team. Our senior corporate management team has extensive insurance experience. In addition, our operating units have strong management and underwriting teams, that also have extensive insurance industry experience. Our management has significant experience in all aspects of property/casualty insurance, including underwriting, claims management, actuarial analysis, reinsurance and regulatory compliance. In addition, Hallmark’s senior management has a strong track record of acquiring businesses that expand our product offerings and improve our profitability profile.

  Our Strategy
 We strive to become a “Best in Class” specialty insurance company offering products in specialty and niche markets through the following strategies:

· | Focusing on underwriting discipline and operational efficiency. We seek to consistently generate an underwriting profit on the business we write in hard and soft markets. Our operating units have a strong track record of underwriting discipline and operational efficiency, which we seek to continue. We believe that in soft markets our competitors often offer policies at a low or negative underwriting profit in order to maintain or increase their premium volume and market share. In contrast, we seek to write business based on its profitability rather than focusing solely on premium production. To that end, we provide financial incentives to many of our underwriters and independent agents based on underwriting profitability.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Achieving organic growth in our existing business lines. We believe we can achieve organic growth in our existing business lines by consistently providing our insurance products through market cycles, expanding geographically, expanding our product offerings, expanding our agency relationships and further penetrating our existing customer base. We believe our extensive market knowledge and strong agency relationships position us to compete effectively in our various specialty and niche markets. We also believe there is a significant opportunity to expand some of our existing business lines into new geographical areas and through new agency relationships while maintaining our underwriting discipline and operational efficiency. In addition, we believe there is an opportunity for some of our operating units to further penetrate their existing customer bases with additional products offered by other operating units.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursuing selected, opportunistic acquisitions. We seek to opportunistically acquire insurance organizations that operate in specialty or niche property/casualty insurance markets that are complementary to our existing operations. We seek to acquire companies with experienced management teams, stable loss results and strong track records of underwriting profitability and operational efficiency. Where appropriate, we intend to ultimately retain profitable business produced by the acquired companies that would otherwise be retained by unaffiliated insurers. Our management has significant experience in evaluating potential acquisition targets, structuring transactions to ensure continued success and integrating acquired companies into our operational structure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintaining a strong balance sheet. We seek to maintain a strong balance sheet by employing conservative investment, reinsurance and reserving practices and to measure our performance based on long-term growth in book value per share.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Distribution
 We market our property/casualty insurance products predominately through independent general agents, retail agents and specialty brokers. Therefore, our relationships with independent agents and brokers are critical to our ability to identify, attract and retain profitable business. Each of our operating units has developed its own tailored approach to establishing and maintaining its relationships with these independent distributors of our products. These strategies focus on providing excellent service to our agents and brokers, maintaining a consistent presence in our target niche and specialty markets 

 
  12

 
through hard and soft market cycles and fairly compensating the agents and brokers who market our products. Our operating units also regularly evaluate independent general and retail agents based on the underwriting profitability of the business they produce and their performance in relation to our objectives.
 Except for the products of our Specialty Commercial Segment, the distribution of property/casualty insurance products by our operating units is geographically concentrated. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, five states accounted for approximately 54% of the gross premiums written by our insurance company subsidiaries. The following table reflects the geographic distribution of our insured risks, as represented by direct and assumed premiums written by our business segments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.

 | Specialty | | Standard | | | | | | | | |

State | Segment | | Segment | | Segment | | Total | | Total |

Percent of total | | 75.7 | % | | 13.0 | % | | 11.3 | % | | 100.0 | % | | 

      Underwriting
 The underwriting process employed by our operating units involves securing an adequate level of underwriting information, identifying and evaluating risk exposures and then pricing the risks we choose to accept. Each of our operating units offering commercial, healthcare professional, aviation or public entity insurance products employs its own underwriters with in-depth knowledge of the specific niche and specialty markets targeted by that operating unit. We employ a disciplined underwriting approach that seeks to provide policies appropriately tailored to the specified risks and to adopt price structures that will be supported in the applicable market. Our experienced commercial, healthcare professional, aviation and public entity underwriters have developed underwriting principles and processes appropriate to the coverages offered by their respective operating units.
 We believe that managing the underwriting process through our operating units capitalizes on the knowledge and expertise of their personnel in specific markets and results in better underwriting decisions. All of our underwriters have established limits of underwriting authority based on their level of experience. We also provide financial incentives to many of our underwriters based on underwriting profitability.
 To better diversify our revenue sources and manage our risk, we seek to maintain an appropriate business mix among our operating units. At the beginning of each year, we establish a target net loss ratio for each operating unit. We continually monitor actual net loss ratios against targets. If any line of business fails to meet its target net loss ratio, we seek input from our underwriting, actuarial and claims management personnel to develop a corrective action plan. Depending on the particular circumstances, that plan may involve tightening underwriting guidelines, increasing rates, modifying product structure, re-evaluating independent agency relationships or discontinuing unprofitable coverages or classes of risk.
 An insurance company’s underwriting performance is traditionally measured by its statutory loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, its statutory expense ratio and its statutory combined ratio. The statutory loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of net losses and loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) incurred to net premiums earned, helps to assess the adequacy of the insurer’s rates, the propriety of its underwriting guidelines and the performance of its claims department. The statutory expense ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of underwriting and operating expenses to net premiums written, assists in measuring the insurer’s cost of processing and managing the business. The statutory combined ratio, which is the sum of the statutory loss and LAE ratio and the statutory expense ratio, is indicative of the 

 
  13

 
overall profitability of an insurer’s underwriting activities, with a combined ratio of less than 100% indicating profitable underwriting results.
 The following table shows, for the periods indicated, (i) our gross premiums written (in thousands); and (ii) our underwriting results as measured by the net statutory loss and LAE ratio, the net statutory expense ratio, and the net statutory combined ratio of our insurance company subsidiaries.

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Gross premiums written | $ | 663,015 | | $ | 604,156 | | $ | 549,077 | 
Net statutory loss & LAE ratio | | 69.8 | % | | 79.1 | % | | 71.2 | %
Net statutory expense ratio | | 25.5 | % | | 27.0 | % | | 29.4 | %
Net statutory combined ratio | | 95.3 | % | | 106.1 | % | | 100.6 | %

      These statutory ratios do not reflect the deferral of policy acquisition costs, investment income, premium finance revenues, or the elimination of inter-company transactions required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
 The premium-to-surplus percentage measures the relationship between net premiums written in a given period (premiums written, less returned premiums and reinsurance ceded to other carriers) to policyholders surplus (admitted assets less liabilities), determined on the basis of statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities. State insurance department regulators expect insurance companies to maintain a premium-to-surplus percentage of not more than 300%. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our consolidated premium-to-surplus ratios were 147%, 157% and 146%, respectively.
 Claims Management and Administration
 We believe that effective claims management is critical to our success and that our claims management process is cost-effective, delivers the appropriate level of claims service and produces superior claims results. Our claims management philosophy emphasizes the delivery of courteous, prompt and effective claims handling and embraces responsiveness to policyholders and agents. Our claims strategy focuses on thorough investigation, timely evaluation and fair settlement of covered claims while consistently maintaining appropriate case reserves. We seek to compress the cycle time of claim resolution in order to control both loss and claim handling cost. We also strive to control legal expenses by negotiating competitive rates with defense counsel and vendors, establishing litigation budgets and monitoring invoices.
 Each of our operating units maintains its own dedicated staff of specialized claims personnel to manage and administer claims arising under policies produced through their respective operations. The claims process is managed centrally through a combination of experienced claims managers, seasoned claims supervisors, trained staff adjusters and independent adjustment or appraisal services, when appropriate. All adjusters are licensed in those jurisdictions for which they handle claims that require licensing. Limits on settlement authority are established for each claims supervisor and staff adjuster based on their level of experience. Certain independent adjusters have limited authority to settle claims. Claim exposures are periodically and systematically reviewed by claim supervisors and managers as a method of quality and loss control. Large loss exposures are reviewed at least quarterly with senior management of the operating unit and monitored by Hallmark senior management.
 Claims personnel receive in-house training and are required to attend various continuing education courses pertaining to topics such as best practices, fraud awareness, legal environment, legislative changes and litigation management. Depending on the criteria of each operating unit, our claims adjusters are assigned a variety of claims to enhance their knowledge and ensure their continued development in efficiently handling claims. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 92 claims managers, supervisors and adjusters with an average experience of approximately 16 years.

 Analysis of Losses and LAE
 Our consolidated financial statements include an estimated reserve for unpaid losses and LAE. We estimate our reserve for unpaid losses and LAE by using case-basis evaluations and statistical projections, which include inferences from both losses paid and losses incurred. We also use recent historical cost data and periodic reviews of underwriting standards and claims management practices to modify the statistical projections. We give consideration to the impact of inflation in determining our loss reserves, but do not discount reserve balances.
 The amount of reserves represents our estimate of the ultimate cost of all unpaid losses and LAE incurred. These estimates are subject to the effect of trends in claim severity and frequency. We regularly review the estimates and adjust them as claims experience develops and new information becomes known. Such adjustments are included in current operations, including increases and decreases, net of reinsurance, in the estimate of ultimate liabilities for insured events of prior years.
 Changes in loss development patterns and claim payments can significantly affect the ability of insurers to estimate reserves for unpaid losses and related expenses. We seek to continually improve our loss estimation process by refining our ability to analyze loss development patterns, claim payments and other information within a legal and regulatory environment that affects development of ultimate liabilities. Future changes in estimates of claim costs may adversely affect future period operating results. However, such effects cannot be reasonably estimated currently.
 Additional information relating to our loss reserve development is included under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 6, “Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Reinsurance
 We reinsure a portion of the risk we underwrite in order to control the exposure to losses and to protect capital resources. We cede to reinsurers a portion of these risks and pay premiums based upon the risk and exposure of the policies subject to such reinsurance. Ceded reinsurance involves credit risk and is generally subject to aggregate loss limits. Although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance ceded, we are ultimately liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Reinsurance recoverables are reported after allowances for uncollectible amounts. We monitor the financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis and review our reinsurance arrangements periodically. Reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition, business practices and the price of their product offerings. In order to mitigate credit risk to reinsurance companies, most of our reinsurance recoverable balance as of December 31, 2018 was with reinsurers that had an A.M. Best rating of “A–” or better. We also mitigate our credit risk for the remaining reinsurance recoverable by obtaining letters of credit.
 The following table presents our gross and net premiums written and earned and reinsurance recoveries for each of the last three years (in thousands).

 Investment Portfolio
 Our investment objective is to maximize current yield while maintaining safety of capital together with sufficient liquidity for ongoing insurance operations. Our investment portfolio is composed of fixed-income securities, equity securities and other investments. As of December 31, 2018, we had total invested assets of $627.9 million. If market rates were to increase by 1%, the fair value of our fixed-income securities as of December 31, 2018 would decrease by approximately $7.6 million. The following table shows the fair values of various categories of fixed-income securities, the percentage of the total fair value of our invested assets represented by each category and the tax equivalent book yield of each category of invested assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

      Our investment strategy is to conservatively manage our investment portfolio by investing primarily in readily marketable, investment-grade, fixed-income securities. As of December 31, 2018, 13% of our investment portfolio was invested in equity securities. Our investment portfolio is managed internally. We regularly review our portfolio for declines in value. For fixed maturity investments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired and that we do not intend to sell and will not be required to sell, we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the investment’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows. The remaining difference between the investment’s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is recognized in other comprehensive income.
 The following table details the net unrealized gain balance by invested asset category as of December 31, 2018.

Equity securities | | 12,187 
Other investments | | (2,615)
Total | $ | 5,174 

      As part of our overall investment strategy, we also maintain an integrated cash management system utilizing on-line banking services and daily overnight investment accounts to maximize investment earnings on all available cash.
 Technology
 The majority of our technology systems are based on products licensed from insurance-specific technology vendors that have been substantially customized to meet the unique needs of our various operating units. Our technology systems primarily consist of integrated central processing computers, a series of server-based computer networks and  communications systems that allow our various operations to share systems solutions and communicate to the corporate office in a timely, secure and consistent manner. We maintain backup facilities and systems through a contract with a leading provider of computer disaster recovery services. Each operating unit bears the information services expenses specific to its operations as well as a portion of the corporate services expenses. Increases to vendor license and service fees are capped per annum.

 We believe the implementation of our various technology systems has increased our efficiency in the processing of our business, resulting in lower operating costs. Additionally, our systems enable us to provide a high level of service to our agents and policyholders by processing our business in a timely and efficient manner, communicating and sharing data with our agents and providing a variety of methods for the payment of premiums. We believe these systems have also improved the accumulation and analysis of information for our management.
 Our business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology systems. Publicly reported cybersecurity intrusions have increased recently and the insurance sector as a whole is more exposed than in the past. Cybersecurity threats extend from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems through coordinated, elaborate and targeted activity. We retain highly trained staff committed to the development and maintenance of our information technology systems. We maintain and regularly review recovery plans which are intended to enable us to restore critical systems with minimal disruption. We have established an information security committee to oversee and steer risk management plans to manage these exposures on an ongoing basis. We also employ comprehensive employee engagement and training programs to guard against the potential for malicious attempts to extort sensitive information from our systems using social engineering techniques (also known as “phishing”) and have increased our cyber liability insurance to seek to minimize our post-event financial impacts.
 We recognize the potential for new risks arising alongside the benefits we derive from technological and digital development. We employ technological security measures to prevent, detect and mitigate such threats, including independent and in-house vulnerability assessments, access controls, data encryption, continuous monitoring of our information technology networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Nonetheless, the infrastructure may be vulnerable to security incidents which could result in the disruption of business operations and the corruption, unavailability, misappropriation or destruction of critical data and confidential information (both our own and of third parties). The compromise of personal and confidential information could lead to legal liability or regulatory action under evolving cybersecurity, data protection and privacy laws and regulations enacted in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. In this respect on March 1, 2017, new cybersecurity rules were implemented by the New York Department of Financial Services (the “NYS Cybersecurity Regulation”). These NYS Cybersecurity Regulations impose additional regulatory requirements that seek to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems. We also anticipate additional NAIC regulations as a result of the Insurance Data Security Model Law which will require insurers to meet state requirements beyond those imposed by New York. The implementation of these various regulations impose additional compliance obligations which have necessitated ongoing review of our policies and procedures.
 Ratings
 Many insurance buyers, agents and brokers use the ratings assigned by A.M. Best and other rating agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies from which they are considering purchasing insurance. A.M. Best has pooled its ratings of our AHIC, HIC, HSIC and HNIC subsidiaries and assigned a financial strength rating of “A-” (Excellent) and an issuer credit rating of “a-” to each of these individual insurance company subsidiaries and to the pool formed by the four insurance company subsidiaries. A.M. Best has also assigned a financial strength rating of “A-” (Excellent) and an issuer credit rating of “a-” to HCM. A.M. Best does not assign a financial strength rating or an issuer credit rating to TBIC. An “A–” rating is the fourth highest of 15 rating categories used by A.M. Best. In evaluating an insurer’s financial and operating performance, A.M. Best reviews the company’s profitability, indebtedness and liquidity, as well as its book of business, the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance, the quality and estimated fair value of its assets, the adequacy of its loss reserves, the adequacy of its surplus, its capital structure, the experience and competence of its management and its market presence. A.M. Best’s ratings reflect its opinion of an insurer’s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not an evaluation directed at investors or recommendations to buy, sell or hold an insurer’s stock. Competition
 The property/casualty insurance market, our primary source of revenue, is highly competitive and, except for regulatory considerations, has very few barriers to entry. According to A.M. Best, there were 2,994 property/casualty insurance companies and 2,060 property/casualty insurance groups operating in North America as of July 2, 2018. The primary 

 
  18

 
competition for our Contract Binding operating unit includes such carriers as American Millennium Insurance Company, Canal Insurance Company, Clear Blue Insurance Company, Commercial Alliance Insurance Company, National Casualty Company, National Liability & Fire Insurance Company, Northland Insurance Company, Progressive County Mutual, State National Insurance Company, Prime Insurance Company, Underwriters at Lloyds of London, and Wilshire Insurance Company. Our Specialty Commercial operating unit considers its primary competition for our excess, umbrella and general liability insurance products to include such carriers as American International Group, Inc., First Mercury Insurance Company, Axis Insurance Company, Berkshire Hathaway Companies, Endurance American Specialty Insurance Company,XL Specialty Insurance, Navigators, and W.R. Berkley Corporation and, to a lesser extent, a number of national standard lines carriers such as Travelers Companies, Inc. and Liberty Mutual Group. The primary competitors for our general aviation insurance products produced by our Specialty Commercial operating unit are Old Republic Aviation Managers, Starr Aviation, American International Group, Inc., United States Specialty Insurance Company, W. Brown & Company, United States Aircraft Insurance Group, Global Aerospace and Allianz Aviation Managers. The primary competition for the medical professional liability insurance products produced by our Specialty Commercial operating unit includes such carriers as Admiral Insurance Company, Aspen, Beazley, CNA Financial Corporation, Iron Health, Kinsale Insurance Company, Markel, Medical Protective Insurance Company, ProAssurance Corporation, RSUI Group and TDC Companies. The primary competition for the financial professional liability insurance products produced by our Specialty Commercial operating unit are Admiral Insurance Company, American International Group Companies, Argonaut Insurance Company, Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, Euclid Executive Liability Managers, Berkley Insurance Company, CNA Financial Corporation, Evanston Insurance Company, Kinsale Insurance Company, RSUI Group, Hiscox USA, and XL Catlin Insurance Company. The primary competition for our primary/excess commercial property insurance products includes such carriers as Chubb Westchester, Aspen Insurance, Everst National Insurance Company, RSUI Group, Navigators Specialty Insurance Company, Starr Surplus Lines, Ironshore Specialty Insurance Company, Axis Insurance Company, and Markel Insurance Company. Our Standard Commercial P&C operating unit competes with a variety of large national standard commercial lines carriers such as Liberty Mutual Group, Travelers Companies, Inc., Cincinnati Financial Corporation and The Hartford Financial Services Group, as well as numerous smaller regional companies. Although our Specialty Personal Lines operating unit competes with large national insurers such as Allstate Corporation, GEICO Corporation and Progressive Insurance Company, as a participant in the non-standard personal automobile marketplace its competition is most directly associated with numerous regional companies and managing general agencies. Our competitors include entities that have, or are affiliated with entities that have, greater financial and other resources than we have. Generally, we compete on price, customer service, coverages offered, claims handling, financial stability, agent commission and support, customer recognition and geographic coverage. We compete with companies who use independent agents, captive agent networks, direct marketing channels or a combination thereof.
 Insurance Regulation
 AHIC, HCM and TBIC are domiciled in Texas, HIC and HNIC are domiciled in Arizona and HSIC is domiciled in Oklahoma. Therefore, our insurance operations are regulated by the Texas Department of Insurance, the Arizona Department of Insurance and the Oklahoma Insurance Department, as well as the applicable insurance department of each state in which we issue policies. Our insurance company subsidiaries are required to file quarterly and annual statements of their financial condition prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices with the insurance departments of their respective states of domicile and the applicable insurance department of each state in which they write business. The financial conditions of our insurance company subsidiaries, including the adequacy of surplus, loss reserves and investments, are subject to review by the insurance department of their respective states of domicile.
 Periodic financial and market conduct examinations. The insurance departments of the states of domicile for our insurance company subsidiaries have broad authority to enforce insurance laws and regulations through examinations, administrative orders, civil and criminal enforcement proceedings, and suspension or revocation of an insurer’s certificate of authority or an agent’s license. The state insurance departments that have jurisdiction over our insurance company subsidiaries may conduct on-site visits and examinations of the insurance companies’ affairs, especially as to their financial condition, ability to fulfill their obligations to policyholders, market conduct, claims practices and compliance with other laws and applicable regulations. Typically, these examinations are conducted every three to five years. In addition, if circumstances dictate, regulators are authorized to conduct special or target examinations of insurance companies to address particular concerns or issues. The results of these examinations can give rise to injunctive relief, regulatory orders 

 
  19

 
requiring remedial or other corrective action on the part of the company that is the subject of the examination, assessment of fines, or other penalties against that company. In extreme cases, including actual or pending insolvency, the insurance department may take over, or appoint a receiver to take over, the management or operations of an insurer or an agent’s business or assets.
 Guaranty funds. All insurance companies are subject to assessments for state-administered funds that cover the claims and expenses of insolvent or impaired insurers. The size of the assessment is determined each year by the total claims on the fund that year. Each insurer is assessed a pro rata share based on its direct premiums written in that state. Payments to the fund may generally be recovered by the insurer through deductions from its premium taxes over a specified period of years.
 Transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates. Hallmark is also regulated as an insurance holding company by the Texas Department of Insurance, the Arizona Department of Insurance and the Oklahoma Insurance Department. Financial transactions between Hallmark or any of its affiliates and our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to regulation. Transactions between our insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates generally must be disclosed to state regulators, and prior regulatory approval generally is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated or any management agreement, services agreement, expense sharing arrangement or other contract providing for the rendering of services on a regular, systematic basis is implemented. State regulators may refuse to approve or may delay approval of such a transaction, which may impact our ability to innovate or operate efficiently.
 Dividends. Dividends and distributions to Hallmark by our insurance company subsidiaries are restricted by the insurance regulations of the respective state in which each insurance company subsidiary is domiciled. As property/casualty insurance companies domiciled in the state of Texas, AHIC and TBIC may only pay dividends from unassigned surplus funds. In addition, AHIC and TBIC must obtain the approval of the Texas Department of Insurance before the payment of extraordinary dividends, which are defined as dividends or distributions of cash or other property the fair market value of which combined with the fair market value of each other dividend or distribution made in the preceding 12 months exceeds the greater of: (1) statutory net income as of the prior December 31 or (2) 10% of statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the prior December 31. HIC and HNIC, both domiciled in Arizona, may pay dividends out of that part of their available surplus funds that is derived from realized net profits on their business. Without prior written approval from the Arizona Department of Insurance, HIC and HNIC may not pay extraordinary dividends, which are defined as dividends or distributions of cash or other property the fair market value of which combined with the fair market value of each other dividend or distribution made in the preceding 12 months exceeds the lesser of: (1) 10% of statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the prior December 31 or (2) net  income as of the prior December 31. HSIC, domiciled in Oklahoma, may only pay dividends out of that part of its available surplus funds that is derived from realized net profits on its business. Without prior written approval from the Oklahoma Insurance Department, HSIC may not pay extraordinary dividends, which are defined as dividends or distributions of cash or other property the fair market value of which combined with the fair market value of each other dividend or distribution made in the preceding 12 months exceeds the greater of: (1) 10% of statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the prior December 31 or (2) statutory net income as of the prior December 31, not including realized capital gains. As a county mutual, dividends from HCM are payable to policyholders.
 Risk-based capital requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners requires property/casualty insurers to file a risk-based capital calculation according to a specified formula. The purpose of the formula is twofold: (1) to assess the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory capital and surplus based upon a variety of factors such as potential risks related to investment portfolio, ceded reinsurance and product mix; and (2) to assist state regulators under the RBC for Insurers Model Act by providing thresholds at which a state commissioner is authorized and expected to take regulatory action. As of December 31, 2018, the adjusted capital under the risk-based capital calculation of each of our insurance company subsidiaries substantially exceeded the minimum requirements.
 Required licensing. Our non-insurance company subsidiaries are subject to and in compliance with the licensing requirements of the department of insurance in each state in which they produce business. These licenses govern, among other things, the types of insurance coverages, agency and claims services and products that we may offer consumers in these states. Such licenses typically are issued only after we file an appropriate application and satisfy prescribed criteria.

Generally, each state requires one officer to maintain an agent license. Claims adjusters employed by us are also subject to the licensing requirements of each state in which they conduct business. Each employed claim adjuster either holds or has applied for the required licenses. Our premium finance subsidiaries are subject to licensing, financial reporting and certain financial requirements imposed by the Texas Department of Insurance, as well as regulations promulgated by the Texas Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner.
 Regulation of insurance rates and approval of policy forms. The insurance laws of most states in which our subsidiaries operate require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval. State insurance regulators have broad discretion in judging whether our rates are adequate, not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory and whether our policy forms comply with law. The speed at which we can change our rates depends, in part, on the method by which the applicable state’s rating laws are administered. Generally, state insurance regulators have the authority to disapprove our rates or request changes in our rates.
 Restrictions on cancellation, non-renewal or withdrawal. Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurance company’s ability to exit a market. For example, certain states limit an automobile insurance company’s ability to cancel or not renew policies. Some states prohibit an insurance company from withdrawing from one or more lines of business in the state, except pursuant to a plan approved by the state insurance department. In some states, this applies to significant reductions in the amount of insurance written, not just to a complete withdrawal. State insurance departments may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption.
 Investment restrictions. We are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and that limit the amount of investments in certain categories. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, would require divestiture.
 Trade practices. The manner in which we conduct the business of insurance is regulated by state statutes in an effort to prohibit practices that constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Prohibited practices include disseminating false information or advertising; defamation; boycotting, coercion and intimidation; false statements or entries; unfair discrimination; rebating; improper tie-ins with lenders and the extension of credit; failure to maintain proper records; failure to maintain proper complaint handling procedures; and making false statements in connection with insurance applications for the purpose of obtaining a fee, commission or other benefit.
 Unfair claims practices. Generally, insurance companies, adjusting companies and individual claims adjusters are prohibited by state statutes from engaging in unfair claims practices on a flagrant basis or with such frequency to indicate a general business practice. Examples of unfair claims practices include:

· | misrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation and settlement of claims arising under insurance policies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time after proof of loss statements have been completed;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | attempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a reasonable person would have believed such person was entitled;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | attempting to settle claims on the basis of an application that was altered without notice to, or knowledge and consent of, the insured;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | compelling insureds to institute suits to recover amounts due under policies by offering substantially less than the amounts ultimately recovered in suits brought by them;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | making claim payments to an insured without indicating the coverage under which each payment is being made;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | delaying the investigation or payment of claims by requiring an insured, claimant or the physician of either to submit a preliminary claim report and then requiring the subsequent submission of formal proof of loss forms, both of which submissions contain substantially the same information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | failing, in the case of claim denials or offers of compromise or settlement, to promptly provide a reasonable and accurate explanation of the basis for such actions; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.
