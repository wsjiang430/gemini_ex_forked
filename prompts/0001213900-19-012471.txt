ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Overview
 
BoxScore Brands, Inc. (formerly U-Vend Inc.) (the “Company”) develops, markets and distributes various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America. The Company seeks to place its kiosks in high-traffic host locations such as big box stores, restaurants, malls, airports, casinos, universities, and colleges. Currently, the Company leases, owns and operates its kiosks, and intends in the future to also provide the kiosks, through a distributor relationship, to entrepreneurs wanting to own their own business.
 
The Company has made a strategic shift to enter into the alternative wellness industry and will distribute brands as well as look for opportunities to make acquisitions and develop proprietary brands in the space. The Company will initially focus on brands and products in the cannabidiol (“CBD”) and cannabis space. CBD is extracted from cannabis or hemp. The Company will begin by distributing brands through its wholesale distribution network and will use its existing assets in the vending space as well.
 
Asset Sale
 
On March 18, 2019, the Company approved of an asset sale of certain assets of the legacy MiniMelts business and operation for $350,000 in cash, which was approved by a majority of shareholders. In 2018, MiniMelts sales accounted for approximately $1,100,000 in revenue. Part of the proceeds from the sale will be used to retire certain lease obligations as well as for general operating purposes.
 
The Company will continue to pursue sales of MLB ice cream under the Major League Baseball license and additionally, leverage its vending assets to pursue new revenue streams and test concepts for new offerings at retail.
 
The Board of Directors has agreed to begin to explore the development of certain products in the cannabis industry with a focus on non-THC Cannabinoids in frozen desserts as well as other complimentary CBD product offerings though vending as well as online sales and direct to retail, under a new brand.


Technology
 
The Company’s “next-generation” vending kiosks incorporate advanced wireless technology, creative concepts, and ease of management. Its kiosks have been designed to be tech-savvy and can be managed online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, accepting traditional cash payment, as well as credit and debit cards. Host locations and suppliers have been drawn to this distribution concept of product vending based on the advantages of reduced labor and lower product theft as compared to non-kiosk merchandising platforms.
 
The increasing demand for cannabis related products in the health and wellness industry will support utilization and growth of the Company’s technologies at retail.
 
Distribution
 
Currently, the Company distributes a novelty ice cream product, MLB Ice Cream and Nightfood frozen desserts, through a network of 21 automated retail vending kiosks and 87 reach in freezers. On April 25, 2019 the Company signed a distribution agreement with Pellequr, LLC for the distribution and marketing of CBD salves, tinctures, bath products and vape pens.
Marketing
 
The Company takes a ‘solutions development’ approach for the marketing of products through a variety of kiosk offerings. This approach has the ability to add digital LCD monitors to most makes and models of their kiosk program. This allows digital advertising on a national and/or local-loop basis, and represents a corresponding additional revenue stream for the Company. The Company is transitioning its product offering into the health and wellness category focused on cannabis and kiosks with monitors will be effective in educating consumers on this new category of products.
Licensing
 
The Company entered into a license agreement effective as of January 1, 2016 and continuing through December 31, 2019 with Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. (“MLB”) for the non-exclusive right to certain proprietary intangible property of the MLB to be used in connection with the manufacturing, distribution, promotion and advertisement of an ice cream novelty product to be sold within the U.S., the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. The Company plans to sell pallets of MLB ice cream to large national wholesale distributors as well as through reach-in MLB branded freezers which include a digital advertising screen. The Company received an initial purchase order for pallets of MLB ice cream in May 2018 and shipped this product in June. In November 2017, the Company extended its agreement with MLB initially through calendar year 2018, and subsequently through 2019. Additionally, the Company has a revenue sharing agreement with MLB for on screen advertising at point-of-sale.

Other Operational Matters
 
The Company’s marketing activities are conducted through sales representatives. Raw materials used in the Company’s operations are widely available but are purchased from a limited number of sources in order to obtain favorable prices and terms.

Vending kiosks and related products compete on the basis of design capability, price, quality and ability to meet delivery requirements.
Employees
