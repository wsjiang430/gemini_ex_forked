Current Economic Environment
The current economic environment remained challenging in Fiscal 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the global economy continued to impact the Company’s operations in Fiscal 2022, including through temporary store closures. While trends in the severity of new cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. improved throughout Fiscal 2022, caseloads have periodically increased in certain global regions, most notably, in the Asia-Pacific Region (“APAC”) in conjunction with the easing of strict lockdowns and zero-tolerance policy shutdowns in China. 
In addition, while the direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have shown signs of abatement, the Company has experienced various other adverse impacts in the current economic environment, including supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures including higher freight and labor costs, labor shortages, and weak store traffic. 
The adverse consequences of the pandemic and of the current economic environment continue to impact the Company and may persist for some time. The Company will continue to assess impacts on its operations and financial condition, and will respond as it deems appropriate.

OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Omnichannel Initiatives
As customer shopping preferences continue to shift and customers increasingly shop across multiple channels, the Company aims to create best-in-class customer experiences and grow total company profitability by delivering improvements through a continuous test-and-learn approach. With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Fiscal 2020, the Company experienced an acceleration in sales fulfilled through digital channels. Despite, this acceleration in the shift towards digital channels, stores continue to be an important part of the customers’ omnichannel experience and the Company believes that the customers’ experience is improved by its offering of omnichannel capabilities, which include: 
•Purchase-Online-Pickup-in-Store, allowing customers to purchase merchandise through one of the Company’s websites or mobile apps and pick-up the merchandise in store, which often drives incremental in-store sales;
•Curbside pickup at a majority of U.S. locations;
•Same-day delivery service across its entire U.S. store fleet. Each brand’s website features a “Get It Fast” filter to easily find products that are available, or shoppers can choose the same-day delivery option for available items at checkout; 
•Order-in-Store, allowing customers to shop the brands’ in-store and online offerings while in-store;
•Reserve-in-Store, allowing customers to reserve merchandise online and try it on in-store before purchasing;
•Ship-from-Store, which allows the Company to ship in-store merchandise to customers and increases inventory productivity; and 
•Cross-channel returns, allowing customers to return merchandise purchased through one channel to a different channel.
The Company also believes that its loyalty programs, Hollister House Rewards® and Abercrombie’s myAbercrombie®, are important enablers of its omnichannel strategy as the Company aims to seamlessly interact and connect with customers across all touchpoints through members-only offers, items and experiences. Under these programs, customers accumulate points primarily based on purchase activity and earn rewards as points are converted at certain thresholds. These rewards can be redeemed for merchandise discounts either in-store or online. The loyalty programs continue to provide timely customer insights, and the Company believes these programs contribute to higher average transaction value.
Digital Operations
In order to create a more seamless shopping experience for its customers, the Company continues to invest in its digital infrastructure. The Company has the capability to ship merchandise to customers in more than 110 countries and process transactions in 26 currencies and through 25 forms of payment globally. The Company operates desktop and mobile websites for its brands globally, which are available in various local languages, and four mobile apps. In the third quarter of Fiscal 2022 the Company launched Share2PayTM, a new payment feature in the Company’s mobile apps that allows customers to easily share their digital shopping bags with a purchaser to complete the purchase. Initially available exclusively in the Hollister mobile app, as of the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, Share2PayTM is available across each of the Company’s mobile apps. The Company continues to develop its mobile capabilities as mobile engagement continues to grow, with over 83% of the Company’s digital traffic generated from mobile devices in Fiscal 2022. In addition, in its efforts to expand its international brand reach, the Company also partners with certain third-party e-commerce platforms.
Store Operations
The Company continues to thoughtfully open new stores and invest in smaller omni-enabled store experiences that align with local customer shopping preferences. New store formats are designed to provide the opportunity for higher productivity through a smaller footprint. During Fiscal 2022, the Company opened 59 new store locations, remodeled one store location and right-sized an additional eight store locations. These stores are designed to be open and inviting, and include accommodating features such as innovative fitting rooms and omnichannel capabilities. Also included in our new store openings for Fiscal 2022 are 14 Gilly Hicks stand-alone locations. These stores are tailored to reflect the personality of each brand, with unique furniture, fixtures, music and scent adding to a rich brand experience. The Company’s stores continue to play an essential role in creating brand awareness and serving as physical gateways to the brands. Stores also serve as local hubs for online engagement as the Company continues to grow its omnichannel capabilities to create seamless shopping experiences. 
The Company continues to evaluate and manage its store fleet through its ongoing global store network optimization initiative and has taken actions to optimize store productivity by remodeling, right-sizing or relocating stores to smaller square footage locations, and closing legacy stores. As part of this initiative, the Company closed 26 stores during Fiscal 2022. The actions taken in Fiscal 2022 continued to transform the Company's operating model and reposition the Company for the future as the Company continues to focus on aligning store square footage with digital penetration.

The Company primarily used seven contract carriers to ship merchandise and related materials to its North American customers, and several contract carriers for its international customers during Fiscal 2022.
COMPETITION
The Company operates in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive retail business environment. Competitors include: individual and chain specialty apparel retailers; local, regional, national and international department stores; discount stores; and digitally-native brands and online-exclusive businesses. Additionally, the Company competes for consumers’ discretionary spend with businesses in other product and experiential categories such as technology, restaurants, travel and media content. 
The Company competes primarily on the basis of differentiating its brands from those of its competition through product, providing higher quality and increased newness; brand voice, amplifying and consolidating brand messaging; and experience, investing in immersive, participatory omnichannel shopping environments.
Operating in a highly competitive industry environment can cause the Company to engage in greater than expected promotional activity, which would result in pressure on average unit retail and gross profit. Refer to “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - Our failure to operate in a highly competitive and constantly evolving industry could have a material adverse impact on our business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the potential impacts competition may have on the Company. 
SEASONAL BUSINESS
Historically, the Company’s operations have been seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: the spring season, which includes the first and second fiscal quarters (“Spring”) and the fall season, which includes the third and fourth fiscal quarters (“Fall”). The Company experiences its greatest sales activity during Fall, due to back-to-school and holiday sales periods. Refer to “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company strives to create a culture that not only drives strategic and key business priorities forward, but is welcoming, inclusive, diverse and encourages associates to create a positive impact in their global communities. The Company believes that the strength of its unique culture is a competitive advantage, and intends to continue building upon that culture to improve performance across its business. 
Therefore, the Company believes that the attraction, retention, and management of qualified talent representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets - and fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment - are integral to its success. Highlights of our key human capital management programs and efforts include the following: 
•Living a corporate purpose of “Being here for you on the journey to being and becoming who you are.” The Company’s corporate purpose was developed after conducting listening sessions with its associates and its customers, and by weaving in key themes from each of the brand purposes. 
•Offering competitive compensation and benefits, to help the Company attract, motivate, and retain the key talent necessary to achieve outstanding business and financial results. The Company’s compensation offerings includes cash-based and equity-based incentive awards in order to align the interests of associates and stockholders, and in the second half of Fiscal 2021, the Company expanded the pool of associates eligible to receive cash-based incentive awards by extending eligibility to additional associates across various job levels. In addition, the Company continues to evolve its approach to work flexibility, including supporting remote work arrangements for key roles and “work from anywhere days and weeks” for our corporate home office associates where feasible. We also support our associates and their families beyond our competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits offerings, providing eligible associates with paid parental leave in the United States and internationally based on local law, and in 2022 we started offering adoption and fertility support benefits for eligible associates globally.
•Improving associate engagement through open communication channels with a focus on development. The Company regularly holds all-company meetings to communicate with its associates. The Company also collects feedback through various engagement surveys to better understand associate experience and drive improvements, with the most recent organization-wide survey conducted in August 2022. 
•Fostering associate development by providing a wide variety of growth and development opportunities throughout associates’ careers. This includes stretch assignments, internal career pathing, self-awareness exercises, and active coaching. The Company also uses leadership standards to help associates identify the core behaviors essential for their career growth, as well as personal growth, on their journey at the Company. In Fiscal 2022, the Company launched the internal job board, which empowers associates to apply for open roles and/or to seek advancement opportunities within the Company.
•Embracing inclusion and diversity in all forms, including gender, race, ethnicity, disability, nationality, religion, age, veteran status, LGBTQIA+ status, and other factors. The Company continuously reviews metrics including representation, retention, pay, and promotion among associates from diverse backgrounds, including those in leadership positions. The Company also encourages associates to enhance their understanding of inclusion and diversity through participating in the Company’s various associate resource groups, which allow associates from different business functions around the world to have discussions, attend activities, and receive materials focused on allyship, community, celebration, and education. Additionally, the Company invests in inclusion and diversity learning and development opportunities for associates on topics including bias, allyship, and advocacy, conducting roundtable discussions, trainings and workshops. 
•Encouraging community involvement of its associates by promoting various charitable, philanthropic, and social awareness programs, which the Company believes fosters a collaborative and rewarding work environment. The Company provides support to global organizations in the form of cash donations, volunteerism and in-kind support. In partnership with its vendor partners, customers and associates, the Company is proud to support community partners serving youth, teens, and young adults with a focus on mental health and wellness, empowerment, and inclusion and diversity. The Company offers its associates a paid volunteer day each year for eligible volunteer work. 
•Focusing on the health and safety of its associates by investing in various wellness programs that are designed to enhance the physical, financial, and mental well-being of its associates globally. The Company provides benefits-eligible associates and their families with access to free and confidential counseling through our Employee Assistance Program, as well as free access to Headspace, a mediation and mindfulness app. The Company also provides regular programming on financial planning and mental health.
