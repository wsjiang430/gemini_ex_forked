ITEM 1: Business.
Overview
​
Our mission is to accelerate electric vehicle (“EV”) adoption and to be a catalyst in the transition of commercial fleets to all-EVs for a more sustainable future. We are an EV innovator focused on developing high-quality, light-duty, work vehicles. We believe we are one of the only North American light duty original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) focused solely on EVs for commercial fleet customers. We believe the large commercial fleet market presents a unique opportunity for vehicles designed specifically for the needs of these customers. We are implementing a strategy designed to accelerate the launch of new commercial EVs. This includes working on our own vehicle programs as well as partnering with third parties, including Foxconn and its affiliates (defined below), as we seek to leverage our vehicle development experience, our proprietary and open-source code and other non-proprietary technologies, our existing Endurance vehicle platform, and potentially new vehicle platforms to drive commonality and scale, and more efficiently develop and launch EVs, to enhance capital efficiency and achieve profitability.
​
The transactions entered into with Foxconn in 2021 and 2022 (collectively, the “Foxconn Transactions”) were part of a shift in our business strategy from a vertically integrated OEM designer, developer and manufacturer of EVs into a less capital-intensive OEM business focused on developing, engineering, testing and industrializing vehicles in partnership with Foxconn. Since November of 2021, Foxconn has invested approximately $103 million in our Class A common stock and Preferred Stock (defined below). Under the terms of the Investment Agreement (defined below), and subject to conditions, including, without limitation, regulatory approvals and satisfaction of certain EV program milestones, Foxconn is expected to purchase up to approximately $117.3 million in additional Class A common stock and Preferred Stock. No assurance can be given that each of the conditions to subsequent fundings by Foxconn will be satisfied or as to the timing of any such fundings. Furthermore, under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement (defined below), Foxconn acquired our automotive assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio for approximately $257 million in total consideration, as described below. 
​
The sale of the Lordstown facility allowed us to meaningfully reduce our operating complexity and fixed cost structure by transferring to Foxconn current and future manufacturing employees along with fixed overhead costs, such as maintenance, utilities, insurance and more. Foxconn is one of the world’s largest manufacturers with unique experience scaling operations and an announced strategy to establish a presence in the global EV market. Outsourcing our manufacturing to a highly qualified partner enables us to leverage Foxconn’s technology, supply chain network and expertise to accelerate the launch of our vehicle programs.
​
Since inception, we have been developing our flagship vehicle, the Endurance™, an electric full-size pickup truck. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company started commercial production of the Endurance with the first two vehicles completing assembly in September. The Company subsequently completed homologation and testing and received required certifications enabling us to begin sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. Engineering readiness, quality and part availability governed the initial timing and speed of the Endurance launch. The rate of Endurance production remained very low during the fourth quarter as these factors

continued to impact production. We have experienced performance and quality issues with certain Endurance components that have led us to temporarily pause production and customer deliveries in the first quarter of 2023. Some of these issues were discovered by us or our suppliers, though some were experienced by our initial customers. In this regard, we filed paperwork with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) to voluntarily recall the Endurance to address supplier quality issues regarding an electrical connection issue that could result in a loss of propulsion while driving and a brake component that our supplier notified us was not to specification. The Company is diligently working with suppliers on the root cause analysis of each issue and potential solutions, which in some cases may include part design modifications, retrofits and software updates. Performance issues are often discovered as an entirely new vehicle with several new technologies begins operating in new and different environments by customers. As a result, through February 2023, approximately 40 Endurance vehicles have been completed or are in process and we have sold a total of six vehicles of our planned initial batch of up to 500 units. As we continue to address Endurance performance and component quality issues and manage continued supply chain constraints with key components, including hub motor components, we anticipate production will remain paused or very low and potentially increase starting as early as the second quarter of 2023. 
​
Our ongoing production and sales volume and rate will be subject to our ability to address these performance issues and consistently receive parts of acceptable quality in the appropriate quantities. Disruptions caused by one or more of these factors could lead to further pauses in vehicle builds or completed vehicle shipments or recalls.
​
If and when these matters are resolved, we anticipate increasing the rate of production and sale of our first batch of up to 500 Endurance vehicles in order to seed the commercial fleet market, demonstrate the capabilities of the truck, and support our OEM partnership pursuits, which is critical to scaling production. Because our current bill of material (“BOM”) cost for the Endurance is well above our current selling price, we are limiting our expected production to up to 500 units in order to minimize our losses, which we anticipate for the foreseeable future.
​
Sale of Lordstown Plant
​
On May 11, 2022, Lordstown EV Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Lordstown EV”), closed the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement with Foxconn EV Technology, Inc., an Ohio corporation, and an affiliate of Hon Hai Technology Group (“HHTG”; either HTTG or applicable affiliates of HTTG are referred to herein as “Foxconn”), dated November 10, 2021 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement” or “APA” and the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby, the “APA Closing”). 
Pursuant to the APA, Foxconn purchased Lordstown EV’s manufacturing facility located in Lordstown, Ohio. Lordstown EV continues to own our hub motor assembly line, as well as our battery module and pack line assets, certain tooling, intellectual property rights and other excluded assets, and it outsources all of the manufacturing of the Endurance to Foxconn under the Contract Manufacturing Agreement. Lordstown EV also entered into a lease pursuant to which Lordstown EV leases space located at the Lordstown, Ohio facility from Foxconn for its Ohio-based employees. 
​
The $257 million in proceeds from the sale of the Lordstown facility consisted of the $230 million initial purchase price for the assets, plus $8.9 million for expansion investments and an $18.4 million reimbursement for certain operating expenses from September 1, 2021 through the APA Closing. In connection with the APA Closing, the Company issued warrants to Foxconn that are exercisable until the third anniversary of the APA Closing for 1.7 million shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $10.50 per share (the “Foxconn Warrants”). In October 2021, prior to entering into the APA, Foxconn purchased 7.2 million shares of the Company’s Class A common stock for approximately $50.0 million.
Contract Manufacturing Agreement
​

6



On May 11, 2022, Lordstown EV and Foxconn entered into a manufacturing supply agreement (the “Contract Manufacturing Agreement” or “CMA”) in connection with the APA Closing. Pursuant to the Contract Manufacturing Agreement, Foxconn (i) manufactures the Endurance at the Lordstown facility for a fee per vehicle, (ii) following a transition period, procures components for the manufacture and assembly of the Endurance, subject to sourcing specifications provided by Lordstown EV, and (iii) provides certain post-delivery services. The CMA provides us with an almost entirely variable manufacturing cost structure and alleviates us of the burden to invest in and maintain the Lordstown facility.
​
The CMA requires Foxconn to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist with reducing component and logistics costs and reducing the overall BOM cost of the Endurance, and otherwise improve the commercial terms of procurement with suppliers. However, given the limited production volume of the first batch of the Endurance, and in the event we do not scale production, we do not anticipate that we will realize any material reduction of costs or improvement in commercial terms. Foxconn conducts testing in accordance with procedures established by us and we are generally responsible for all motor vehicle regulatory compliance and reporting. The Contract Manufacturing Agreement also allocates responsibility between the parties for other matters, including component defects, quality assurance and warranties of manufacturing and design. Foxconn invoices us for manufacturing costs on a fee per vehicle produced basis, and to the extent purchased or incurred by Foxconn, component and other costs. Production volume and scheduling are based upon rolling weekly forecasts we provide that are generally binding only for a 12-week period, with some ability to vary the quantities of vehicle type.
​
The CMA became effective on May 11, 2022 and continues for an initial term of 18 months plus a 12-month notice period in the event either party seeks to terminate the agreement. In the event no party terminates the Contract Manufacturing Agreement following the initial term, it will continue on a month-to-month basis unless terminated upon 12 months’ prior notice. The CMA can also be terminated by either party due to a material breach of the agreement and will terminate immediately upon the occurrence of any bankruptcy event.
​
Investment Agreement
​
On November 7, 2022, we entered into an investment agreement with Foxconn (the “Investment Agreement”) under which Foxconn agreed to make an additional equity investment in the Company through the purchase of $70 million of our Class A common stock and up to $100 million in Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Preferred Stock”), subject to conditions, including, without limitation, regulatory approvals and satisfaction of certain EV program milestones established by the parties (collectively, the “Investment Transactions”). 
On November 22, 2022, the Company completed the initial closing under the Investment Agreement, at which Foxconn purchased (a) approximately 12.9 million shares of Class A common stock, at a purchase price of $1.76 per share, and (b) 0.3 million shares of Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of $100 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $52.7 million (the “Initial Closing”). 
​
The Investment Agreement also provides for a second closing (the “Subsequent Common Closing”), at which Foxconn will purchase approximately 26.9 million additional shares of Class A common stock at a purchase price of $1.76 per share following the parties’ receipt of a written communication from the U.S. government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) that CFIUS has concluded that the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement are not a “covered transaction” or CFIUS has concluded that there are no unresolved national security concerns with respect to the transactions (“CFIUS Clearance”) and subject to the other conditions set forth in the Investment Agreement. Upon satisfaction of certain EV Program (as defined below) milestones (including establishing an EV Program budget) and subject to satisfaction of other conditions set forth in the Investment Agreement, Foxconn will purchase in two tranches up to 0.7 million additional shares of Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $100 per share. The first tranche will be in an amount up to 0.3 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $30 million; the second tranche will be in an amount up to 0.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $40 million. The parties have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon the EV Program budget and 

7



program milestones no later than May 7, 2023. However, no assurances can be given that each of the conditions to subsequent funding by Foxconn will be satisfied or as to the timing of any such fundings.
​
Of the up to $117.3 million that we could receive in additional funding from Foxconn, $70 million may only be used in connection with the initial planning, designing, developing, engineering, testing, industrializing, certifying, homologating and launching one or more EVs in collaboration with Foxconn (the “EV Program”). Notwithstanding this funding arrangement, we will continue to require substantial additional capital in order to fulfill our business plans under the EV Program and otherwise.  See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks associated with the Foxconn Transactions and our need to raise additional capital.
​
Our Strengths and Strategy
​
We seek to capture a meaningful share of the commercial fleet EV market by focusing on the strengths described below. Our strategy is heavily dependent upon our ability to realize the benefits of our relationship with Foxconn and there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so.

​

● | Valuable partnership potential with Foxconn, which has significant EV industry ambitions and identified us as a preferred North American vehicle development partner. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from Foxconn’s strategy to bring a unique approach to developing and driving growth in the EV industry, along with its global reach, manufacturing excellence and significant capital. Foxconn has announced its intentions to become a significant player in EVs, building on its 17-year history in automotive parts manufacturing, to expand further into high value components and full vehicle assembly. Foxconn has announced significant capital and operational commitments to advance its goals, including new vehicle concepts introduced in Asia, collaborations and joint ventures with numerous Asian and global OEMs, investments in the Company, the purchase of the automotive assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio and the establishment of the MIH consortium. The MIH consortium enables all participants to benefit from virtual scale that is anticipated to achieve more efficient new vehicle development and a faster path to profitability through the use of a shared common core of hardware components and an architecture across OEMs to create benefits of scale. The Company, with its design, engineering and development expertise, seeks to capitalize on its relationship with Foxconn and the MIH consortium to create a new EV-native model based on increased collaboration, together with component and sub-system commonality and re-use, leading to reduced costs and vehicle development cycles. The Company intends to facilitate collaboration further upstream in the development process and by providing expertise and building upon a multi-use platform. Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, on November 22, 2022, Foxconn invested $52.7 million in our Class A common stock and Preferred Stock, and we could receive an additional $117.3 million, subject to satisfaction of certain program milestones and other conditions set forth in the Investment Agreement. While we have established initial frameworks for our relationship with Foxconn, we are highly dependent on its continued collaboration for future vehicle

development and there can be no assurances that we will achieve the program milestones or that our efforts will ultimately lead to an approved vehicle program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Contract manufacturing arrangement to utilize Foxconn’s production-ready domestic plant to build EVs also provides strategic location. Foxconn’s facility in Lordstown, Ohio is one of the largest automotive assembly plants in North America and is in a production-ready state. The Contract Manufacturing Agreement provides for the manufacturing of the Endurance at the facility, and reduces our operating complexity and allows for a highly variable cost structure. The Lordstown facility is strategically located near a major interstate highway between Cleveland, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Lordstown, Ohio, and the surrounding area is home to a highly trained workforce with experience manufacturing vehicles, as well as an extensive automotive supply base. The Company’s collaboration with the Foxconn EV ecosystem is also expected to encourage more Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive suppliers to locate near the Lordstown facility. Supply chain localization should contribute to reduced logistics costs and supply chain risks. Furthermore, as a domestic EV production site, we and our customers may benefit from the recent Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that is anticipated to provide financial incentives for vehicles and components produced in the United States.

​

● | Significant opportunity exists in the commercial fleet market. We believe there is significant demand in the commercial segment for EVs that will remain unmet for several years. We believe our sole focus on light duty EVs for commercial fleets provides us a meaningful advantage by enabling us to design vehicles with the functionality and particular needs of these customers in mind. Beginning with the Endurance, we intend to build strong customer relationships with fleet operators and companies that rent or lease vehicles to fleet operators to accelerate EV adoption. We believe that fleet operators will be drawn to the lower total cost of ownership of EVs despite the higher initial purchase price, which has been a factor limiting the pace of adoption of EVs. We also believe that fleet usage, which in many cases may involve multiple shorter trips within range of a central base, rather than long-distance travel, can reduce the range anxiety that has also been a limiting factor in EV adoption. We anticipate that many of our customers will be return-to-base operations, meaning that the vehicles will be charged at charging stations at the fleet operator’s base location. This will reduce dependency on charging infrastructure that is still developing. As a result, we expect strong demand for safe, reliable EVs with a significantly reduced total cost of ownership and believe the Endurance and future vehicle programs will provide the opportunity for us to capture meaningful share in this market.

​

● | The Endurance has a unique and efficient design featuring in-wheel hub motor, battery pack and powertrain technologies. The technology and engineering developed or used by us to date have led to operational prototype, beta, pre-production, and commercial production vehicles that serve as our initial entry into the commercial fleet market. The design of the Endurance features in-wheel hub motors that eliminate the need for many parts found in both traditional and existing EVs. In addition, the in-wheel hub motors contribute to the Endurance’s advanced traction handling and maneuverability, features that are important to commercial fleet customers. We believe that, with a strategic partner to support the scaling of the program, along with additional design enhancements and investments in tooling, the Endurance will represent an attractive product for potential customers.

​
Industry and Competition
​
EV industry growth has accelerated in the past several years. According to EV Volumes.com, global sales of EVs within the light vehicle segment grew 55% in 2022 from 2021 and reached 10.5 million units, comprising 13.0% of all light vehicles sold annually. We believe this growth will continue into the future as increased offerings, technological developments, reduced costs and additional charging infrastructure are expected to drive broader adoption. We expect countries around the world to become increasingly focused on meeting climate goals, in part, by reducing the environmental effects of internal combustion engine vehicles. This may 

9



include offering financial incentives to promote the use of EVs and commitments from major automotive manufacturers to electrification as part of their long-term plans.
​
Our primary target market is the commercial fleet segment, which is defined as commercial and governmental organizations with three or more vehicles and is a large potential market with strong demand for vehicles. Customers in this market include logistics companies, construction, building trade and other service providers, utilities, airlines, airport operators, telecommunication companies and insurance companies, as well as small- to mid-sized companies with fewer than 10 vehicles in their fleets. Commercial fleets purchase vehicles either directly from OEMs or indirectly through fleet management companies, dealers or other intermediaries. Government entities at the federal, state and local level represent a significant share of the fleet market that we believe will participate in the transition to EVs and represent potential customers.
​
We believe that there is significant opportunity to gain a share of this market by offering EVs with the functionality and particular needs of these customers in mind. We anticipate substantial commercial demand for electric trucks will be driven by the potential for lower total cost of ownership in comparison to traditional gasoline and diesel internal combustion engine vehicles. We also believe that a meaningful portion of industry demand will come from large well-capitalized fleet operators with commitments to reduce their carbon footprint. The specific use cases for electric trucks by fleet operators which often involve multiple shorter trips, can alleviate the range anxiety that has been a limiting factor in EV adoption to date. By effectively marketing to commercial fleet operators, we believe we have the potential to secure significant and recurring purchases for our EVs. 
​
Although competition within the broader EV and pickup market is intense, we believe that our focus on fleet customers will differentiate our vehicle offerings. While established OEMs and new entrants to the industry are developing or have launched electric pickup trucks, we believe the Endurance can be a highly competitive vehicle. Furthermore, with relatively low production volume of EV pickup trucks anticipated to be sold in the near term, we believe the fleet market will represent the smallest share of sales as the larger OEMs seek to sell to a segment of the EV pickup truck market that is conducive to higher price points. 
​
We believe our relationship with Foxconn and its EV ecosystem will provide the opportunity to accelerate the pace and reduce the cost of new vehicle development through increased cross-industry collaboration and rapid innovation. Leveraging a common core of hardware components enables greater customization through design, as well as hardware and software optimization. Foxconn’s global manufacturing expertise and robust supply chain can provide the electronics hardware stack, and potentially more as it seeks to develop capabilities in other core EV components that can be shared across multiple vehicles and OEMs. Foxconn’s MIH consortium exists to bring the talent and resources together to accelerate EV innovation and development through open collaboration. The MIH consortium can support the design and engineering process and ultimately other vehicle components, subsystems, hardware and software. No assurance can be given that we will ultimately be successful in further vehicle development or that we will be able to effectively realize the potential benefits of the MIH consortium or development partnership with Foxconn. See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks associated with the Foxconn Transactions and other related agreements being contemplated with Foxconn, including as a basis for further funding under the Investment Agreement.
​
The Endurance
​
Our flagship vehicle is the Endurance. The design of the Endurance body follows the same design principles that have made pickup trucks ideal for the fleet market, while its chassis is designed for safety, capability, efficiency and flexibility. The Endurance’s bed box is designed to be fully compatible with existing third-party parts, upfitting options and accessories. Our use of in-wheel hub motors together with the Endurance’s proprietary software, is intended to provide better traction, maneuverability and handling, making it an ideal vehicle for fleet operators. We believe that the Endurance will have among the fewest moving parts of any highway-capable production vehicle currently being sold and will have a total cost of ownership that is lower than comparable internal combustion pickup trucks that are currently commercially available. Pricing for the 

10



Endurance, which is subject to change, is currently approximately $65,000 including our standard option package and destination charges, but excluding any applicable U.S. tax credits or other incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. We believe our option package consists of popular equipment sought by commercial fleet customers.
​
Many fleet customers consider the total cost of ownership of a vehicle to be more important than the initial purchase price of a vehicle. We believe the capabilities of EVs generally, and in particular the low number of parts, will lead to lower maintenance costs over time when compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. The need for routine maintenance is significantly reduced along with the elimination of the need to service or replace parts and materials for internal combustion engines, such as spark plugs, oil, oil filters, and transmission fluid. In addition, the Endurance’s brake pads and rotors are expected to last longer than those in internal combustion engine pickup trucks due to regenerative braking from the hub motors on all four wheels, representing another maintenance cost saving. As a result, over a five-year period, we anticipate that the average total cost of ownership of the Endurance is likely to be less than the average total cost of ownership of a comparable internal combustion engine pickup truck.
​
At the current BOM cost, we are limiting production of the Endurance to an initial batch of up to 500 units. However, we believe the attributes of the Endurance could present a compelling offering to customers. We continue to seek a strategic partner to support the scaling of the program along with additional design enhancements and investments in tooling that would enable us to significantly reduce the BOM cost. We believe the North American full size pickup truck market is one of the most attractive and profitable industry segments in the world. Therefore, we believe the Endurance, as only the second homologated and certified full size EV pickup truck in the market, provides an attractive opportunity for another OEM to enter the segment relatively quickly and with substantially lower investment than independently developing a similar vehicle. There can be no assurances that we will be able to find a strategic partner, or negotiate an agreement with a potential partner on a reasonable timeline or on favorable terms and as a result of this and other factors, the actual number of vehicles produced could be significantly below 500. 
​
Electric In-Wheel Hub Motors
​
The Endurance has four electric in-wheel hub motors. We have entered into supply and licensing agreements with Elaphe Propulsion Technologies Ltd. (“Elaphe”) to produce the initial batch of required hub motors. However, we intend to begin using our own manufacturing line for the in-wheel hub motors at the Lordstown facility in the near future, which we believe will increase our rate of production and lower our BOM cost. As part of our Contract Manufacturing Agreement with Foxconn, Foxconn operates these hub motor production assets on our behalf. We believe the hub motors provide efficiency, reliability and design flexibility and offer several advantages over traditional internal combustion engines. For example, in-wheel hub motors place the entire propulsion system within the wheels, providing a significant amount of design flexibility for the remainder of the vehicle. 
​
In-wheel hub motors contribute to the superior traction and maneuverability of the Endurance. They also eliminate the need for many parts found in both traditional and hybrid vehicles, including a drivetrain, gears, axles, differentials, universal joints, transmissions, oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves, which reduces the number of moving parts in the Endurance compared to other traditional, hybrid and EVs available today and, therefore, expected maintenance costs.
​
Each hub motor and inverter pair are controlled by a central supervisory powertrain controller that manages traction, slip and efficiency on an axial basis, which we expect to provide favorable four-wheel drive traction when compared to other pickup trucks currently available to commercial fleets. The Company has developed its own proprietary powertrain controller software and algorithms to achieve this performance using instantaneous torque control. The use of in-wheel hub motors and the absence of a traditional internal 

11



combustion engine create a large front crush zone, enhancing the safety of the vehicle and enabling the Endurance to have a “frunk” (a small trunk located at the front of the cab).
​
The motors are equipped with regenerative braking that captures and stores power generated by deceleration of the vehicle. Many of the systems that enable the use of in-wheel hub motors, such as the software that interacts and directs each of the four motors, as well as the independent front suspension, are proprietary to us.
​
Facilities
We lease space from Foxconn in Lordstown, Ohio for office space, and also lease facilities in Farmington Hills, Michigan and Irvine, California.
In November 2020, we opened our research, development and engineering center in Farmington Hills, Michigan. This facility includes space for engineering, product development, vehicle inspection and benchmarking, as well as labs for testing, validation and prototyping. This facility also houses our purchasing group as well as certain other corporate functions. In September 2022, we expanded our office space by leasing an additional building near our research, development and engineering center.
In Irvine, California, we have established an engineering, vehicle development, and service center. This facility is focused primarily on developing advanced electronic hardware and software for our infotainment system as well as our cybersecurity, connected vehicle and fleet services systems. We have established Lordstown EV Sales, LLC to receive direct orders from customers and have received our dealership license from the State of California.
​
Key Agreements, Other Alliances and Technology
​
GM
​
We have entered into several agreements with GM and its affiliates related to the acquisition and operation of the Lordstown facility and to provide financing arrangements. On November 7, 2019, we entered into an Asset Transfer Agreement, Operating Agreement and Mortgage Agreement (collectively, the “GM Property Agreements”) with GM providing for our acquisition and the continued operation of the Lordstown facility.
​
On April 3, 2020, we entered into an agreement under which GM provides us with access to certain non-brand defining GM parts, including airbags, steering columns and steering wheels. This agreement was renewed for a term commencing on January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2023. On December 21, 2021, we entered into a further five year-term supply agreement which required a pre-payment of $17.8 million and made available to us the referenced parts for up to 9,500 vehicles. As of December 31, 2022, we reviewed our prepaid GM components and royalties for impairment given that the production volume of the Endurance is not anticipated to exceed 500 units. Therefore, we determined it appropriate to impair these assets and other prepaid assets and recorded a charge of $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Notwithstanding the impairment charge, we will continue to have the right to acquire the parts for which we have already paid and intend to evaluate our options to mitigate the actual losses.
​
Elaphe Propulsion Technologies Ltd.
​
We have partnered with Elaphe to produce in-wheel hub motors. We entered into a license agreement with Elaphe, pursuant to which Elaphe granted us a perpetual license to manufacture, or have manufactured, the Elaphe Model L-1500 Endurance Motor, including enhanced or replacement versions of this motor, for use in the United States, Canada and Mexico in exchange for a license fee calculated on a per motor basis. We have substantially enhanced Elaphe’s Model L-1500 Endurance Motor and currently are using these enhanced motors in our vehicles. Elaphe is required to obtain our consent before it is permitted, within the United States, Canada or Mexico, to market, sell or otherwise distribute the Elaphe Model L-1500 Endurance Motor, or any replacement or substitute for it, including our enhanced version of the motor, or any hub motor, 

12



or replacement or substitute for it, for a substitute model pickup truck replacing the Endurance (the “Licensed Products”). In addition, Elaphe must immediately notify us if it sells, licenses or distributes the Licensed Products through a third party within the United States, Canada or Mexico and must offer to sell or license to us on the same terms available to such third party.
​
Equity Sales Agreement
​
On November 7, 2022, the Company entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC, as agent (“Jefferies”), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell up to approximately 50.2 million shares of its Class A common stock from time to time through Jefferies (the “ATM Offering”). During 2022, Jefferies sold approximately 7.8 million shares of Class A common stock which resulted in net proceeds of $12.4 million. In the future, any additional sales will depend on a variety of factors and no assurance can be given that the Company will sell any shares of Class A common stock under the Sales Agreement, or, if it does, as to the price or amount of the shares that it sells or the dates when such sales will take place. Even if funds are raised under the ATM Offering, the Company will require additional financing to execute its business plan. 
​
We entered into an equity purchase agreement (“Equity Purchase Agreement”) with YA II PN, LTD. (“YA”) on July 23, 2021, pursuant to which YA committed to purchase up to $400 million in shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement. The actual amount that we were able to raise under this facility was dependent on market conditions as well as limitations in the agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued 17.5 million shares to YA and received $40.4 million cash, net of equity issuance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, inclusive of the 0.4 million Commitment Shares (as defined below), we issued 9.6 million shares to YA and received $49.4 million cash, net of equity issuance costs. The Equity Purchase Agreement was terminated on November 22, 2022.

Other Partners
​
To provide our customers with aftermarket service and warranty support we have entered into an agreement with a third-party provider under which the parties will coordinate to provide EV service and warranty work for Lordstown vehicles, i.e., the Endurance vehicles, in key states where allowed by law. We expect a strategic rollout of participating service locations from within their provider’s network to Lordstown’s launch plan for initial fleet customers. Technicians at these service locations will complete Lordstown’s vehicle service training curriculum and the third-party will provide service solutions, including warranty and preventative and scheduled maintenance.
​
Research and Development
​
We expect to continue to incur costs for the Endurance for post-launch testing, to address any current or new launch-related issues identified, or other Endurance related matters, in order to deliver a quality product to our customers. Our research and development also includes efforts to seek to leverage our technologies to develop additional all-EVs targeted for the commercial EV market in cooperation with Foxconn and its affiliates, and potentially other strategic partners. Our vehicle development efforts in collaboration with Foxconn will also require significant investments, beyond the current investments by Foxconn as contemplated under the Investment Agreement. We expect that these activities will generally be completed by our employees and intend to hire additional research and development personnel. However, we have utilized third party design and engineering firms for certain development activities to date and will continue to do so for the Endurance and additional vehicles that we may develop in the future. No assurance can be given that we will ultimately be successful in further vehicle development or that we will be able to effectively realize the potential benefits of the development partnership with Foxconn.
​
Sourcing
​

13



The Endurance’s BOM consists of approximately 3,200 components with 10 suppliers providing systems representing almost 70% of the total direct materials cost. In an effort to reduce supply chain risk, we purchased and have on-hand a significant portion of the vehicle components necessary for the initial batch of production. Motors and battery cells represent two of the Endurance’s most critical components. As discussed above, we have an agreement with Elaphe to license in-wheel hub motors and we have procured all the battery cells we anticipate needing for the initial production of up to 500 units of the Endurance. Key raw materials that are in the Endurance and its components are steel, aluminum, copper, neodymium, nickel and cobalt. The prices for and availability of these materials fluctuate depending on factors beyond our control.
​
Disruptions to the supply chain, including those due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted in and continue to present challenges in obtaining certain components and raw materials in a timely manner and/or at favorable pricing. In addition, the automotive and other industries are currently experiencing a global supply shortage of semiconductors. Inflation has also significantly impacted the prices of key raw materials included in the Endurance and its components as well as labor costs and certain indirect costs, such as utilities. Furthermore, currency fluctuations, labor shortages, tariffs or shortages in petroleum, steel and aluminum or other raw materials, the direct and indirect effects of the war in Ukraine and other economic or political conditions have impacted the transportation industry and resulted and may continue to result in significant increases in freight charges, delays in obtaining critical materials or changes in the specifications for those materials. Moreover, our low production volumes have contributed to certain production suppliers curtailing or ceasing supply, or in some cases, materially raising the prices we must pay for certain components. These factors have impacted and are expected to impact our testing and production costs, and volume and timeline of full production.
As a result, we have adjusted and may continue to adjust our design and materials, and production processes to adapt to these limitations. However, the factors described above, capital constraints, business conditions, the impact of COVID-19 or other pandemics, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control could affect our ability to receive the material we need for full production. 
​
Engineering readiness, quality and part availability have governed the timing and speed of the Endurance launch. In the first quarter of 2023, performance and quality issues with certain Endurance components led us to temporarily pause production and customer deliveries and to voluntarily recall the Endurance while we work with our supplier network to implement corrective actions. We anticipate that continued supply chain constraints with certain key components, including hub motor components, will remain at least through the first quarter of 2023 and potentially ease starting as early as the second quarter of 2023. If and when these ongoing matters are resolved, we anticipate increasing the rate of production and sale of the initial batch of up to 500 Endurance vehicles. However, we continue to monitor closely the key components that are in short supply and no assurances can be given that part availability and quality will not restrict production further.
​
Due to these factors and our limited initial production volume, our current BOM cost is substantially higher than the current selling price of the Endurance. Until such time as we are able to lower the BOM cost, we are limiting our expected production to up to 500 units in order to minimize our losses, which we anticipate for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our BOM cost below the current selling price for the Endurance. 
​
Increased demand or cost, reduced supply or quality issues for certain materials or components, whether due to EV growth, trade restrictions or other factors, may further increase our costs or delay the timing to obtain the materials or components and impact our production timeline, profitability and cash flows. See Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding sourcing.

Intellectual Property
​
We use a combination of widely available non-proprietary technology and proprietary know-how in our business. We intend to establish and protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we develop through a combination of trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how. We have filed numerous trademark and patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, but as of this date no trademarks or patents have been issued. 
​
We expect to develop additional intellectual property and proprietary technology as the Endurance’s engineering and validation activities proceed and we expand into developing other vehicles. Technologies that we have and intend to invest in and develop include engineering software, powertrain systems and controls, infotainment, cybersecurity, telematics and electrical architecture hardware and software. As we develop our technology, we will continue to assess whether additional trademark or patent applications or other intellectual property registrations are appropriate. We also seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, including trade secrets and know-how, through limited access, confidentiality and other contractual agreements. In addition to the intellectual property that we own, we license and utilize key technologies under our agreements with Elaphe. See “— Key Agreements, Other Alliances and Technology ¾ Elaphe Propulsion Technologies Ltd.” for more information.
We cannot be certain that we will be able to adequately develop and protect our intellectual property rights, or that other companies will not claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. We also use open-source code and other non-proprietary technology that is not protected from use by our competitors. See Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding intellectual property. 
​
Sales and Marketing 
​
We plan to focus our sales and marketing efforts on direct sales through our subsidiary, Lordstown EV Sales, LLC, to commercial fleet operators and fleet management companies rather than through third-party dealerships. However, we intend to explore other distribution strategies as our business grows.
​
An important aspect of our sales and marketing strategy involves pursuing relationships with specialty upfitting and fleet management companies to incorporate the Endurance and future vehicles we may develop into their fleets or sales programs. As their main area of business, fleet management companies act as an intermediary facilitating the acquisition of new vehicles for the ultimate end user fleets. They provide a valuable distribution channel for us because of their extensive end user relationships and ability to offer attractive financing rates. We have several agreements in place with fleet management companies that establish a framework for co-marketing and sales. These agreements do not commit the counterparties to purchase vehicles. As we develop our sales and aftermarket service strategy, we are focusing on sales in regions where we have local resources. Furthermore, we consider a number of factors when seeking sales and allocating available new vehicles to customers. These factors include, among others, the customer’s fleet size, the area in which the vehicles will be operated, the possibility of a strategic long-term relationship and in-house maintenance capabilities. To date, we have received non-binding indications of interest or pre-orders for the Endurance from various parties and, as we evaluate the allocations of vehicles we may produce, there remains uncertainty as to whether we will seek to and to what degree we will be able to convert previously-reported nonbinding pre-orders and other indications of interest in our vehicle into binding orders and ultimately sales. We have also received reservations from potential customers who have provided us with a $100 deposit totaling approximately $220,000 as of December 31, 2022, that may be cancelled without penalty and a full refund of any deposit. As a result of our sales strategy, we expect that we will not be required to make significant investments in a large direct sales force or third-party dealership network, thereby avoiding an increase in fixed costs.
​
Human Capital Resources
​

15



As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 260 full-time personnel in our Lordstown, Ohio, Farmington Hills, Michigan and Irvine, California facilities. These employees’ skills are in the areas of engineering, marketing, sales, purchasing, facilities, human resources, IT, supply chain, quality, program management, software design, strategy, legal, accounting and finance. The vast majority of our employees are engineers focused on vehicle development, including the Endurance and future vehicle programs. We have additional employees to support aftermarket service and warranty work on the Endurance and future vehicles. In connection with the Foxconn Transactions in May 2022, substantially all of our manufacturing employees, along with certain other employees, transferred to and became employees of Foxconn.
​
Government Support and Regulation
​
In addition to the discussion in this section, also see Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Risks Relating to Regulation and Claims.”
​
Our management expects to continue to engage in discussions with local, state and federal officials to explore the availability of appropriate grant, loan and tax incentives. There are numerous enacted federal programs that we believe will directly or indirectly support the growth of EVs, including among commercial fleet customers. These include the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 that provided $7.5 billion for a national EV charging network through grants to state and local governments, transit authorities and tribes. The bill also included measures to promote greater electrification of the transportation sector, funding to expand battery processing and manufacturing and a surface transportation block grant program.
​
We have been awarded grants of up to $2.1 million from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. To date, we’ve received $1.0 million in grant funding, and are finalizing the documentation for the outstanding grants. The grants include claw back provisions through May 2024 if the conditions of the grants are not met and no assurances can be made as to the timing or ultimate amount of the funding.
​
The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act adopted in August 2022 (“IRA”) provides tax credits intended to grow the domestic supply chain and domestic manufacturing base for electric and other “clean” vehicles and to incentivize the purchase of qualified commercial and retail clean vehicles. These incentives are phasing in and will remain in effect until approximately 2032, unless modified by Congress. The IRA establishes numerous and complex prerequisites for the tax credits, including that the vehicle must be assembled in North America; the vehicle must be under specified limitations on manufacturer suggested retail price (“MSRP”); purchaser income limitations; starting in 2024, any vehicle that contains “battery components” that were “manufactured or assembled” by a “foreign entity of concern” will be ineligible; and, starting in 2025, any vehicle that contains battery materials that were “extracted, processed, or recycled” by a “foreign entity of concern” will be ineligible. A “Critical Minerals Credit” is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of critical minerals that are “extracted or produced” in the United States, in a country with which the United States has a Free Trade Agreement, or that is “recycled” in North America. A “Battery Components Credit” is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of “value” of its battery “components” that are “manufactured or assembled” in North America. The availability of such benefits will depend on the terms of the regulations and guidance issued by the government to implement the IRA, which will ultimately determine which vehicles qualify for incentives and the amount thereof. We are still evaluating the potential benefits of the IRA to the Company and its customers. 
​
We have accepted an invitation from the U.S. Department of Energy and have started the due diligence process toward securing an Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (“ATVM”) loan. Established in 2007, ATVM supports the development of fuel-efficient, advanced technology vehicles in the United States. The program provides loans to automotive or component manufacturers for establishing manufacturing facilities in the United States that produce fuel-efficient vehicles. There can be no assurance this loan will be available to us and, if made available, what the terms, collateral requirements and timing for any funding would be. In the near term, we do not believe that we would be able to satisfy the conditions to obtain an ATVM loan, including the requirement to demonstrate our viability as a company. 
​

16



We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive vehicle safety and testing and environmental regulations, some of which evolve over time as new technologies are introduced to the market. Government regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and implementation of products and systems similar to the Endurance or other vehicles that we may develop are subject to future change. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes will have upon our business. Violations of these regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines, penalties and/or orders to cease the operations in violation or to conduct or pay for corrective work. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits and licenses. In addition to the domestic regulations and standards discussed below, we expect to comply with Canadian standards and believe these standards are substantially similar to the domestic standards. Based on our initial business plan, we do not expect to be subject to regulatory requirements outside of the U.S. and Canada.
​
Vehicle Safety and Testing Regulation
​
Our vehicles are subject to, and must comply with, many regulations established by NHTSA, including applicable U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards (“FMVSS”). As an OEM, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and, when applicable, the NHTSA bumper standards before a vehicle can be manufactured for sale, offered for sale, introduced into interstate commerce, imported into or sold in the United States. There are many FMVSS that apply to our vehicles, including crashworthiness and crash avoidance requirements and EV requirements (e.g., those relating to limitations on electrolyte spillage, battery retention and the avoidance of electric shock after a crash). We believe the Endurance does, and our future vehicles will, meet all applicable FMVSS. However, we have experienced performance and quality issues with certain Endurance components that have led us to temporarily pause production and customer deliveries in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, there are regulatory changes being considered for several FMVSS, and though we expect to comply with such changes, there is no assurance of compliance until the final regulatory changes have been enacted and we are able to evaluate the vehicles’ compliance with those new FMVSS requirements.
In addition to FMVSS, we must comply with other NHTSA requirements and other federal laws and regulations administered by NHTSA, including, for example, early warning reporting requirements, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) reporting, an obligation to conduct recalls of vehicles in the field upon a determination of a safety defect or noncompliance and owner’s manual requirements. In this regard, we filed paperwork with NHTSA to voluntarily recall the Endurance to address supplier quality issues. Lordstown is working with its supplier network to implement corrective actions that the Company believes will address these issues. We also must comply with the Automobile Information and Disclosure Act, which requires OEMs to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and other pricing. Further, this law allows inclusion of fuel economy metrics (e.g. range and cost savings), as determined by the U.S. EPA, and crash test ratings, as determined by NHTSA.
​
Battery Safety and Testing Regulations 
​
Our battery packs must conform to mandatory regulations governing the transport of “dangerous goods” that may present a risk in transportation, which items include lithium-ion batteries and are subject to regulations issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). These regulations are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods - Model Regulations and related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. The regulations vary by the mode of transportation by which these items are shipped (e.g., by ocean vessel, rail, truck or air). There are additional industry standards related to the development and testing of EV batteries, including for example, standards published by the Society of Automotive Engineers, International Organization for Standards and Underwriters Laboratories. The use, handling, storage, disposal and exposure of our battery packs are also subject to many different regulations at the federal, state and local levels.
​

17



Environmental Credits 
​
In connection with the delivery and placement into service of our zero-emission vehicles (“ZEV”), under the U.S. EPA’s and California’s Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) rules and standards and the U.S. CAFÉ standards for mobile sources, and under California’s ZEV standard, we will earn tradable credits that can be sold to other OEMs. Like the United States, California also has its own GHG emissions standard that seeks to reduce GHGs over time. Other U.S. states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont, have adopted some or all of California’s standards. We intend to take advantage of these regulatory frameworks by registering and selling GHG, CAFÉ and ZEV credits. In addition, we have entered into an emissions credit agreement with GM pursuant to which, and subject to the terms of which, until the completion of the first three annual production/model years wherein we produce vehicles at least ten months out of the production/model year, the counterparty will have the option to purchase such emissions credits as well as emissions credits from any other U.S. state, country or jurisdiction generated by vehicles produced by us and not otherwise required by us to comply with emissions laws and regulations at a purchase price equal to 75% of the fair market value of such credits. While we have launched the Endurance as a 2023 model year, we are limiting production to up to 500 units. Therefore, the duration of our obligations under this agreement will extend for several years and are ultimately dependent upon whether we are able to launch a new vehicle and the associated timing and/or our ability to obtain a strategic partner to support the scaling of the Endurance.
​
Environmental Regulations
​
We are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, involving, among other matters, water use, discharge air emissions, use of chemicals and recycled materials, energy sources, storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the protection of the environment, natural resources and endangered species and the remediation of environmental contamination. We are required to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of environmental permits, many of which may be difficult and expensive to obtain and must be renewed on a periodic basis. A failure to comply with these laws, regulations or permits could result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties and the suspension or loss of such permits, and possibly orders to cease the non-compliant operations.
​
The U.S. Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity from the U.S. EPA for our vehicles prior to their entry into commerce in all 50 states. In addition, we must obtain an Executive Order from the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) in order to sell vehicles in California and those states that have adopted its standards. The Certificate of Conformity and Executive Order are required for each model year. We have obtained such Certificate of Conformity and such Executive Order for the Endurance.
Corporate History and Information 
​
Lordstown Motors Corp., originally known as DiamondPeak Holdings Corp. (“DiamondPeak”), was incorporated in Delaware on November 13, 2018 as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a business combination and completed its initial public offering in March 2019 (the “Initial Public Offering”). On October 23, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), DiamondPeak consummated the merger pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 1, 2020 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among DiamondPeak, DPL Merger Sub Corp. (“Merger Sub”) and Lordstown Motors Corp. (“Legacy Lordstown” and now known as Lordstown EV Corporation), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy Lordstown, with Legacy Lordstown surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DiamondPeak (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the “Business Combination”). On the Closing Date, and in connection with the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), DiamondPeak changed its name to Lordstown Motors Corp. 
​
The Business Combination has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Under this method of accounting, DiamondPeak was treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. Operations prior to the Business 

18



Combination are those of Legacy Lordstown and the historical financial statements of Legacy Lordstown became the historical financial statements of the combined company, upon the consummation of the Business Combination.

​
Recent Developments
​
On January 26, 2023, we filed a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to Section 205 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), which permits the Court of Chancery, in its discretion, to validate potentially defective corporate acts and stock after considering a variety of factors, due to developments regarding potential interpretations of the DGCL. As previously disclosed, on March 24, 2022, we received a letter addressed to our Board of Directors (the “Board”) from the law firm of Purcell & Lefkowitz LLP (“Purcell”) on behalf of three purported stockholders. Among other matters, the stockholder letter addressed the approval of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) at the special meeting of stockholders held on October 22, 2020, which included a 200 million share increase in the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock (the “2020 Class A Increase Amendment”), and was approved by a majority of the then-outstanding shares of both our Class A and Class B common stock, voting as a single class. The stockholder letter alleged that the 2020 Class A Increase Amendment required a separate vote in favor by at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Class A common stock under Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL, and that the 200 million shares in question were thus unauthorized. Following receipt of the stockholder letter, the Board undertook a review of the matters raised with the assistance of outside counsel not involved in the underlying transactions at issue and had determined, in reliance upon, among other things, advice of several law firms including a legal opinion of Delaware counsel, that the assertions regarding DGCL Section 242(b)(2) were wrong and that a separate class vote of the Class A common stock was not required to approve the 2020 Class A Increase Amendment. We continue to believe that a separate vote of Class A common stock was not required to approve the 2020 Class A Increase Amendment. However, in light of a recent decision of the Court of Chancery that created uncertainty regarding this issue, we filed a petition in the Court of Chancery pursuant to Section 205 seeking validation of the 2020 Class A Increase Amendment and the shares issued pursuant thereto to resolve any uncertainty with respect to those matters. In February 2023, the Court of Chancery held a hearing on our petition and on February 28, 2023 issued an amended order granting the Company’s motion to validate each of the following and eliminate the uncertainty with respect thereto: (1) the 2020 Class A Increase Amendment and the Certificate of Incorporation as of the time of filing with the Delaware Secretary of State, and (2) all shares of capital stock that we issued in reliance on the effectiveness of the 2020 Class A Increase Amendment and Certificate of Incorporation, as of the date such shares were issued.
