Item 1. Business
Overview
Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the "Company," "we," "us," or "our"), together with its subsidiaries, is a global pharmaceutical company that develops, licenses, manufactures, markets and distributes generic and specialty pharmaceutical products in a variety of dosage forms and therapeutic categories. 
The Company is a Delaware corporation and was formed under the name Atlas Holdings, Inc. on October 4, 2017, for the purpose of facilitating the combination (the "Combination") of Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC ("Amneal"), a Delaware limited liability company, and Impax Laboratories, Inc. ("Impax"), a Delaware corporation. Prior to the Combination, Amneal was a privately held limited liability company with a portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products and Impax was a publicly held corporation with a portfolio of generic and specialty pharmaceutical products. On May 4, 2018, the Combination was completed and the Company changed its name from Atlas Holdings, Inc. to Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
As a result of the Combination, Impax became a Delaware limited liability company wholly owned by Amneal and Amneal became the operating company for the combined business. As of February 21, 2019, the group of stockholders who owned Amneal prior to the Combination (the "Amneal Group") hold approximately 57% of the equity interests in Amneal, and the Company holds the remaining 43% of the equity interests in Amneal. Although the Company holds a minority economic interest in Amneal, as the managing member of Amneal we conduct and exercise full control over all activities of Amneal. Accordingly, we report our financial results on a consolidated basis and report a non-controlling interest relating to the economic interest in Amneal not held by the Company. We treat Amneal as the accounting acquirer of Impax in the Combination, and thus the historical financial results of the Company for the periods prior to the closing of the Combination are the historical financial results of Amneal.
For more information about the Combination, see Note 1. Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation.
Recent Transactions
In addition to the Combination, discussed above, we completed the following business development transactions in 2018:

• | On May 4, 2018, we entered into a licensing agreement for the U.S. market with MabXience S.L. for its biosimilar candidate for Avastin® (bevacizumab).


• | On May 7, 2018, we acquired 98.0% of the outstanding equity interests in Gemini Laboratories, LLC ("Gemini"), a company with a portfolio of licensed and owned, niche and mature branded products.


• | On August 16, 2018, we entered into a 10-year license and supply agreement with Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("JSP") for Levothyroxine sodium tablets with an effective date of March 22, 2019.


• | On August 31, 2018, we entered into a 5-year supply and distribution agreement with American Regent, Inc. for the only preservative-free generic alternative to Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection, USP, 250mg/mL).


• | On November 9, 2018, we entered into transition agreement with Lannett Company to begin commercialization of Levothyroxine sodium tablets on December 1, 2018, ahead of the effective date of our agreement with JSP.

Segments of the Business
The Company is organized into two business segments: Generics and Specialty. Prior to the Combination, Amneal had only a generics business and Impax had both a generics and a specialty business. Thus, our Generics segment comprises the generics business of Amneal and the generics business of Impax, and the Specialty segment comprises the specialty business of Impax and the Gemini business, which we acquired on May 7, 2018. 
Generics
Prescription pharmaceutical products are sold either as branded or generic products. Generic pharmaceutical products have the same active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API"), dosage form, potency, route of administration, and intended use as patented branded pharmaceutical products and are usually marketed under their chemical (generic) names rather than brand names. However, generic pharmaceutical products are intended to provide a cost-effective alternative for consumers while maintaining the safety, efficacy and stability of the branded product, and as such are generally sold at prices below their branded equivalents. Typically, a generic pharmaceutical may not be marketed until the expiration of applicable patent(s) on the corresponding branded product, unless the resolution of patent litigation results in an earlier opportunity to enter the market.

Generic manufacturers are required to file and receive approval for an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") in order to market a generic pharmaceutical product. In general, those companies that are able to prepare high quality ANDA submissions are comparatively advantaged. Under the previous Generic Drug User Fee Amendments ("GDUFA") authorization, the time required to obtain Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approval of ANDAs was on average approximately 32-34 months post-filing. In August 2017, GDUFA was reauthorized and signed into law by President Trump as part of the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act. This reauthorization, known as GDUFA II, is in effect from October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2022. As a result of GDUFA II, we expect the average time required to achieve approval of a generic pharmaceutical product after making an ANDA filing to decrease.
The Company’s Generics segment includes over 200 product families covering an extensive range of dosage forms and delivery systems, including both immediate and extended release oral solids, powders, liquids, sterile injectables, nasal sprays, inhalation and respiratory products, ophthalmics (which are sterile pharmaceutical preparations administered for ocular conditions), films, transdermal patches and topicals (which are creams or gels designed to administer pharmaceuticals locally through the skin). We focus on developing products with substantial barriers-to-entry resulting from complex drug formulations or manufacturing, or legal or regulatory challenges. Focusing on these opportunities allows us to offer first-to-file ("FTF"), first-to-market ("FTM") and other high-value products. A generic pharmaceutical product is considered a FTF product if the ANDA filed with respect to such product is the first to be filed for such product. Pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act, FTF products may receive a statutory 180-day exclusivity period, subject to certain conditions. For all reasons other than statutory exclusivity, a generic product is considered an FTM product if it is the first marketed generic version of a branded pharmaceutical . We define high-value products as products with three or fewer generic competitors at the time of launch. FTF, FTM and high-value products tend to be more profitable and often have longer life cycles than other generic pharmaceuticals. See "Pharmaceutical Approval Process in the United States," below, for more information.
As of December 31, 2018, our Generics business had 124 products either approved but not yet launched or pending FDA approval and another 96 products in various stages of development. Over 46% of our total generic pipeline consists of what we believe to be potential FTF, FTM and high-value products. We have an integrated, team-based approach to product development that combines its formulation, regulatory, legal, manufacturing and commercial capabilities.
Specialty
Our Specialty segment is engaged in the development, promotion, sale and distribution of proprietary branded pharmaceutical products, with a focus on products addressing central nervous system ("CNS") disorders, including migraine and Parkinson’s disease. Our portfolio of products includes Rytary®, an extended release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication or manganese intoxication. In addition to Rytary®, our promoted Specialty portfolio includes Zomig® (zolmitriptan) products, for the treatment of migraine headaches, which is sold under a license agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited, Emverm® (mebendazole) 100 mg chewable tablets, for the treatment of pinworm, whipworm, common roundworm, common hookworm and American hookworm in single or mixed infections, and Unithroid® (levothyroxine sodium), for the treatment of hypothyroidism, which is sold under a license and distribution agreement with JSP.
Geographic Areas
We operate in the United States, Switzerland, India, Ireland, the United Kingdom and certain other countries. Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.

Sales & Marketing and Customers
In the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, we market our products primarily through wholesalers and distributors, retail pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies and directly into hospitals and institutions. The majority of our generic pharmaceutical products are marketed to large group purchasing organizations ("GPOs") and sold through wholesalers, directly to large chain retailers or to mail order customers. Our sterile injectable products are generally marketed to GPOs and specialty distributors, and sold through wholesalers, and occasionally directly to large hospitals and institutions. All of our wholesalers purchase products and warehouse them for retail drug stores, independent pharmacies and managed care organizations, such as hospitals, nursing homes, health maintenance organizations, clinics, pharmacy benefit management companies and mail-order customers. In Europe and other foreign jurisdictions, we sell our products to wholesalers, distributors, independent pharmacies and, in certain countries, directly to hospitals. Through a broad network of sales representatives, we adapt our strategy to different markets as dictated by such market’s regulatory and competitive landscapes. We have over 200 customers, some of which are part of large purchasing groups. For the year ended December 31, 2018, on a combined basis, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 83% of our gross revenue, broken out as follows: Cardinal Health, Inc. 31%, AmerisourceBergen Corporation 29% and McKesson Drug Co. 23%.
We have no long-term agreements that guarantee future business with any of our major customers and the loss of or substantial reduction in orders from any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, future prospects and financial condition.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is affected by new technologies, new developments, government regulations, health care legislation, availability of financing, and other factors. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial, research and development, marketing, and other resources than we do. Competing manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products create value for our customers by offering substitutes for branded pharmaceutical products at significantly lower prices, and at times we may not be able to differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors, successfully formulate and bring to market new products that are less expensive than those of our competitors or offer commercial terms as favorable as those of our competitors. We compete with numerous other companies that currently operate, or intend to operate, in the pharmaceutical industry, including companies that are engaged in the development of controlled-release drug delivery technologies and products, and other manufacturers that may decide to undertake development of such products. Our principal competitors in the generic pharmaceutical products market are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Mylan N.V., Endo International plc, Sandoz International GmbH, Pfizer Inc., Fresenius Kabi KGAa, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC and Aurobindo Pharma Limited.
By focusing on our high-value products with complex dosage forms and high barriers to entry, as well as taking advantage of our vertically integrated supply chain and selective use of internal API, we aim to manufacture more profitable products relative to our competition. However, there is no guarantee that this or any future strategy will enable us to compete successfully in the generic pharmaceutical industry.
The Hatch-Waxman Act amended the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and provided for a period of 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity for each applicant that is first-to-file an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification. The holder of the approved ANDA that successfully challenges the relevant innovator drug patent(s) usually enjoys higher market share and sales during the 180-day period of exclusivity. When the exclusivity period concludes, other generic competitors may launch their versions of the product, which may cause significant price erosion and loss of market share. In cases where we are the holder of an ANDA for a FTF product, upon the expiration of the 180 day exclusivity period, we may adjust the price of such product and provide price adjustments to our customers for the difference between the lower price and the price at which we previously sold the product then held in inventory by our customers. These adjustments are commonly known as shelf stock adjustments. In certain circumstances, we may decide not to provide price adjustments to certain customers and, as a result, we may receive returns of unsold product from these customers and forego future sales volume as opposed to reducing pricing.
Authorized generic pharmaceutical products, which are generic labeled versions of pharmaceutical products introduced by brand companies (directly or through a third party) under the brand’s new drug application ("NDA") approval, have also increased competition in the generic pharmaceutical industry. Authorized generic pharmaceutical products may be sold prior to, during and subsequent to the 180-day exclusivity period and are a significant source of competition, because brand companies do not face any regulatory barriers to rapidly introducing generic versions of their pharmaceutical products.
Additionally, consolidation among wholesalers and retailers and the formation of GPOs has caused increased price competition in the generic pharmaceutical market. The downward price adjustments demanded by distributors of generic pharmaceutical 
6

products has reduced revenue and average product gross margin across the industry. Should these price reductions continue or even increase, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margin.
The main competitive factors in the generic pharmaceutical market include: 

• | a generic pharmaceutical products manufacturer’s ability to rapidly develop and obtain regulatory approval for and supply commercial quantities of generic pharmaceutical products;


• | the introduction of other generic pharmaceutical manufacturers’ products in direct competition with our products;


• | the introduction of authorized generic pharmaceutical products in direct competition with our products;


• | consolidation among our customers and the formation of buyer consortia;


• | pricing pressures by competitors and customers;


• | product quality of our generic pharmaceutical competitors;


• | our and our competitors’ breadth of product offerings across its portfolio;


• | our ability and the ability of our generic pharmaceutical competitors to quickly enter the market after the expiration of patents or statutory exclusivity periods, limiting the extent and duration of profitability for our products;


• | the willingness of our customers to switch their source of supply of products among various generic pharmaceutical competitors;


• | the ability of our generic pharmaceutical competitors to identify and market niche products;


• | our and our competitors’ level of service (including maintenance of inventories for timely delivery) and reputation as a reliable developer and manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products; and


• | product appearance and labeling for our products and those of our competitors.

In the brand-name pharmaceutical market, our principal competitors are pharmaceutical companies that are focused on Parkinson’s disease and other CNS disorders. In addition, with respect to products that we are developing internally and/or any additional products we may in-license from third parties, we expect that we will face increased competition from large pharmaceutical companies, drug delivery companies and other specialty pharmaceutical companies that have focused on the same disorders as our branded products.
Research and Development
Research and development ("R&D") activities represent a significant part of our business. Research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy, if applicable, and regulatory compliance prior to launch. We are committed to investing in R&D with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we spent $194 million, $171 million and $179 million, respectively, on R&D.
Raw Materials
Raw materials, including APIs, essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources. We purchase raw materials from distributors of bulk pharmaceutical chemicals and we also manufacture certain APIs at our facilities in India. In some cases, however, the raw materials used to manufacture our products are available only from a single supplier. Further, even if more than one supplier exists, we may choose, and have done so in the case of our API suppliers for a majority of our products, to list only one supplier in our product applications submitted to the FDA. Generally, we would need as long as 18 months to find and qualify a new sole-source supplier. If we receive less than one year’s termination notice from a sole-source supplier that it intends to cease supplying raw materials, it could result in disruption of our ability to produce the drug involved. Although to date, we have only experienced occasional interruptions in supplies, no assurance can be given that we will continue to receive uninterrupted or adequate supplies of such raw materials. Any inability to obtain raw materials on a timely basis, or any significant price increases not passed on to customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Because legal and regulatory requirements mandate that our product marketing authorizations specify API and raw material suppliers, if a specified supplier were for any reason unable to continue to supply us, we would need to seek FDA approval of a new supplier. The resulting delay in the manufacture and marketing of the impacted pharmaceutical product during the FDA process to qualify and approve the new supplier could, depending on the product, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We protect against the risk of such an event by generally providing for, where feasible, two or more suppliers of raw materials for the pharmaceutical products we manufacture, including those for which we manufacture API in-house. Additionally, we may enter into a contract with a raw material distributor in order to secure adequate supply for specific products.

Manufacturing and Distribution
We have a network of ten manufacturing sites and seven co-located R&D centers within the United States, India and Ireland, with broad dosage capability across oral solids, solutions, suspensions, creams, gels, ointments, nasal sprays, hormonals, patches, oral thin films, dry powder inhalers, metered dose inhalers, cytotoxics, injectables, ophthalmics, otics, and tablets / capsules, as described below. We also have a distribution center in Glasgow, Kentucky and a packaging center in East Hanover, New Jersey. We manufacture the vast majority of our products internally; of these products, for the combined year ended December 31, 2018, those manufactured in our U.S. facilities contributed 54% of product net revenue compared to 21% for those manufactured in India as of December 31, 2018. We rely on third-party manufacturers to supply a small number of products in our portfolio representing approximately 25% of our combined net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Most of our Specialty products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers. In addition, we selectively manufacture API for a subset of our products, which helps to reduce the overall cost of manufacturing for our products and gives us greater control over our supply chain.
Government Regulation
The business of developing, manufacturing, selling and distributing generic products is subject to significant environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. These regulatory regimes are overseen by governmental bodies, principally the FDA and, as applicable, the Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA"), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and several state and local government agencies in the United States and abroad. Failure to comply with the regulations of these governmental agencies may result in suspension of regulatory approval and potential civil and criminal actions against us. The regulatory environment, particularly enforcement positions, statues and legal interpretations applicable to the pharmaceutical industry are constantly in flux and not always clear. Significant changes in this environment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
The FDCA, the Controlled Substances Act and other statutes and regulations govern the development, testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval and promotion of our products. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in judicial and or administrative sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions, fines and criminal prosecutions. The FDA has the authority to withdraw its approval of pharmaceuticals at any time, in accordance with its regulatory due process procedures, and can enforce the recall of products.
Pharmaceutical Approval Process in the United States
In the United States, FDA approval is required before any “new drug” may be marketed, including new formulations, strengths, dosage forms and generic versions of previously approved drugs. Generally, the following two types of applications are used to obtain FDA approval of a “new drug.”
New Drug Application
For a drug product containing an active ingredient not previously approved by the FDA, a prospective manufacturer must submit a complete application containing the results of clinical studies supporting the drug product’s safety and efficacy. A NDA is also required for a drug with a previously approved active ingredient if the drug will be used to treat an indication for which the drug was not previously approved or if the dosage form, strength or method of delivery is changed. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally involves the steps listed below, which could take from approximately three to more than ten years to complete.

• | Laboratory and clinical tests;


• | Submission of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before clinical studies may begin;


• | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use;


• | Submission of a NDA containing the results of the preclinical tests and clinical studies establishing the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use, as well as extensive data addressing such matters such as manufacturing and quality assurance;


• | Scale-up to commercial manufacturing; and


• | FDA approval of a NDA.

8

As noted above, the submission of a NDA is not a guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing. It may refuse to file the application and instead request additional information, in which case, the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information. After the application is deemed filed by the FDA, FDA staff will review a NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and efficacious for its intended use.
If, after reviewing the NDA, the FDA determines that the application cannot be approved in its current form, the FDA sends the NDA applicant a Complete Response Letter identifying all outstanding deficiencies that preclude final approval. The FDA then halts its review until the applicant resubmits the NDA with new information designed to address the deficiencies. An applicant receiving a Complete Response Letter may resubmit the application with data and information addressing the FDA’s concerns or requirements, withdraw the application without prejudice to a subsequent submission of a related application or request a hearing on whether there are grounds for denying approval of the application. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, in each case compared to the approval sought, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require an applicant to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market. The agency may also impose requirements that the NDA holder conduct new studies, make labeling changes, implement Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, and take other corrective measures.
Abbreviated New Drug Application
For a generic version of an approved drug-a drug product that contains the same active ingredient as a drug previously approved by the FDA and is in the same dosage form and strength, utilizes the same method of delivery and will be used to treat the same indications as the approved product - the FDA requires only an abbreviated new drug application that ordinarily need not include clinical studies demonstrating safety and efficacy. An ANDA typically requires only data demonstrating that the generic formulation is bioequivalent to the previously approved “reference listed drug,” indicating that the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of the generic drug in the body do not show a significant difference from those of the reference listed drug. In July 2012, GDUFA was enacted into law. The GDUFA legislation implemented fees for new ANDA applications, Drug Master Files, product and establishment fees and a one-time fee for back-logged ANDA applications pending approval as of October 1, 2012. In return, the program was intended to provide faster and more predictable ANDA reviews by the FDA and increased inspections of drug facilities. Under GDUFA, generic product companies face significant penalties for failure to pay the new user fees, including rendering an ANDA application not “substantially complete” until the fee is paid. Prior to the implementation of GDUFA, the FDA took an average of approximately 32-34 months to approve an ANDA. Following the implementation of GDUFA, the FDA’s stated internal goal for ANDAs was to have a “first-action” goal date within 15 months of submission on 75% of submitted ANDAs. The “first-action” goal date is referred to by the FDA as the date in which the FDA takes a first action on an application by either granting approval or tentative approval or in the event of deficiencies, identifying those deficiencies in a complete response letter or in a refusal to receive the application.
The Hatch-Waxman Act established the modern regulatory system for generic pharmaceutical products by creating a standardized approach for generic pharmaceutical makers to file ANDAs and receive FDA approval for generic pharmaceutical products. In order to gain FDA approval, there are various regulatory hurdles that a prospective generic manufacturer must clear:
Current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP")
In order to obtain FDA approval for its products, a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer must demonstrate that its facilities comply with cGMP regulations. The manufacturer is required to comply with cGMP standards at all times during the production and processing of pharmaceuticals, and the FDA may inspect the manufacturer’s sites at any time to ensure compliance.
Safety and Efficacy
With respect to ANDA filings for generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, the FDA waives the requirement for certain clinical trials because the manufacturer of the brand pharmaceutical product has already performed these studies and established the safety and efficacy of the reference pharmaceutical product. However, an ANDA filer is still required to conduct bioequivalence studies to test the generic pharmaceutical product against the brand pharmaceutical product. For most orally administered pharmaceutical products, bioequivalence between brand and generic is established when there is no statistically significant difference in the rate and extent to which the API from the product is absorbed into the bloodstream. For certain pharmaceutical 
9

products, such as topical, locally acting pharmaceutical products, other means of establishing bioequivalence may be required by the FDA. Additionally, an ANDA for a generic pharmaceutical product must contain other information, such as patent certifications and stability, chemistry, manufacturing and labeling data.
Patent Provisions
A branded pharmaceutical product is usually protected under patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that allow only the pharmaceutical company that developed the pharmaceutical product to market and sell such product. For a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer to introduce a generic version of a referenced branded pharmaceutical product, it must submit to the FDA an ANDA with a certification stating one of the following:

• | Paragraph I: That the required patent information relating to the patent for the referenced branded pharmaceutical product has not been filed;


• | Paragraph II: That the patent for the referenced branded pharmaceutical product has expired;


• | Paragraph III: That the patent for the referenced branded pharmaceutical product will expire on a particular date; or


• | Paragraph IV: That the patent for the referenced branded pharmaceutical product is invalid and/or will not be infringed by the pharmaceutical product for which approval is being sought

Filing an ANDA with certifications under Paragraph I or II, referenced above, permits the ANDA to be approved immediately, if it is otherwise eligible. Filing an ANDA with certifications under Paragraph III, referenced above, indicates that the ANDA may be approved on the expiration date of the referenced branded pharmaceutical product’s patent. Under Paragraph IV, referenced above, a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer can challenge the patent of the branded referenced pharmaceutical product.
If the ANDA for a generic pharmaceutical product has a Paragraph IV certification, the filer must also notify the NDA and patent holders upon acceptance of the ANDA filing by the FDA (the "PIV Notice"). The NDA and patent holders may initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response, the filing of which automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of (i) 30 months following receipt of the PIV Notice and/or (ii) a decision in the lawsuit that is favorable to the ANDA filer.
Generic Pharmaceutical Pricing
The pricing of a generic pharmaceutical product nearly always correlates to the number of companies manufacturing generic versions of such pharmaceutical product. A generic pharmaceutical product is usually at its highest price immediately after the first generic launch of the product, either because a single manufacturer has been granted 180-day exclusivity or because only a few manufacturers have entered the market due to other technical or operational obstacles to bringing such product to market, such as raw materials shortages or complex formulation. As additional generic manufacturers enter the market, the price of a generic pharmaceutical product typically falls as manufacturers compete on price to capture market share. Additionally, consolidation among wholesalers and retailers and the formation of GPOs has caused increased price competition in the generic pharmaceutical market.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States, there have recently been multiple federal and state proposals related to the pricing of pharmaceuticals and other changes to the healthcare system. It is currently unclear what, if any, legislative proposals may be adopted or how governmental bodies and private payors will respond to such healthcare reform. As such, we cannot predict the impact of potential legislation on our business and cannot guarantee that such legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Pharmaceutical Pedigree Laws
Various pharmaceutical pedigree laws, such as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act enacted in 2014, require the tracking of all transactions involving prescription pharmaceutical products from the manufacturer to the dispensary (e.g. pharmacy). Compliance with such laws requires extensive tracking systems and tight coordination with customers and manufacturers. While we believe that we currently fully comply with these laws and we intend to do so in the future, such legislation and government enforcement regarding these laws is constantly evolving. Failure to comply could result in fines, penalties or loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
10

Federal Regulation of Patent Litigation Settlements and Authorized Generic Arrangements
Pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, generic and brand pharmaceutical companies must file with the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") and FTC certain agreements entered into between other brand and/or generic pharmaceutical companies in regards to the settlement of patent litigation and/or the manufacture and marketing of generic versions of branded pharmaceutical products. This requirement impacts the ways in which generic pharmaceutical companies resolve intellectual property litigation and may result in an increase in private-party litigation against pharmaceutical companies and/or additional investigations by the FTC or other governmental organizations.
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are subject to the Maximum Allowable Cost Regulations, which limit reimbursements for certain generic prescription drugs under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs to the lowest price at which these drugs are generally available. In many instances, only generic prescription drugs fall within the regulations’ limits. Generally, the pricing and promotion of, method of reimbursement and fixing of reimbursement levels for, and the reporting to federal and state agencies relating to drug products is under active review by federal, state and local governmental entities, as well as by private third-party reimbursors and individuals under whistleblower statutes. At present, the DOJ and U.S. Attorneys Offices and State Attorneys General have initiated investigations, reviews, and litigation into industry-wide pharmaceutical pricing and promotional practices, and whistleblowers have filed qui tam suits. We cannot predict the results of those reviews, investigations, and litigation, or their impact on our business. For further detail, see Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies.
Virtually every state, as well as the District of Columbia, has enacted legislation permitting the substitution of equivalent generic prescription drugs for brand-name drugs where authorized or not prohibited by the prescribing physician, and some states mandate generic substitution in Medicaid programs.
In addition, numerous state and federal requirements exist for a variety of controlled substances, such as narcotics, that may be part of our product formulations. The DEA, which has authority similar to the FDA’s and may also pursue monetary penalties, and other federal and state regulatory agencies have far reaching authority.
The State of California requires that any manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer or other entity in California that sells, transfers, or otherwise furnishes certain so called precursor substances must have a permit issued by the California Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement. The substances covered by this requirement include ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, among others. The Bureau has authority to issue, suspend and revoke precursor permits, and a permit may be denied, revoked or suspended for various reasons, including (i) failure to maintain effective controls against diversion of precursors to unauthorized persons or entities; (ii) failure to comply with the Health and Safety Code provisions relating to precursor substances, or any regulations adopted thereunder; (iii) commission of any act which would demonstrate actual or potential unfitness to hold a permit in light of the public safety and welfare, which act is substantially related to the qualifications, functions or duties of the permit holder; or (iv) if any individual owner, manager, agent, representative or employee of the permit applicant/permit holder willfully violates any federal, state or local criminal statute, rule, or ordinance relating to the manufacture, maintenance, disposal, sale, transfer or furnishing of any precursor substances.
Environmental Laws
We are subject to comprehensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air polluting emissions, waste water discharges, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the remediation of contamination associated with current or past generation handling and disposal activities. We are subject periodically to environmental compliance reviews by various environmental regulatory agencies. While it is impossible to predict accurately the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential remediation activities, compliance with environmental laws is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and other countries covering certain products and product candidates and have also developed brand names and trademarks for other products and product candidates.
11

Generally, the brand pharmaceutical business relies upon patent protection to ensure market exclusivity for the life of the patent. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks and license rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. However, our business is not dependent upon any single patent, trademark or license.
In the branded pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product’s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. In the U.S. and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there can often be very substantial and rapid declines in the branded product’s sales. The rate of this decline varies by country and by therapeutic category; however, following patent expiration, branded products often continue to have market viability based upon the goodwill of the product name, which typically benefits from trademark protection.
An innovator product’s market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovator is entitled.
Patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.
Market exclusivity is also sometimes influenced by regulatory exclusivity rights. Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of medicines. For example, the U.S., the European Union and Japan each provide for a minimum period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator’s data to approve a competitor’s generic copy. Regulatory exclusivity rights are also available in certain markets as incentives for research on new indications, on orphan drugs and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients. Regulatory exclusivity rights are independent of any patent rights and can be particularly important when a drug lacks broad patent protection. However, most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory data exclusivity on the basis of the competitor’s own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even when that drug is identical to that marketed by the innovator.
We estimate the likely market exclusivity period for each of our branded products on a case-by-case basis. It is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for any of our branded products with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity, and inherent uncertainties concerning patent litigation. There can be no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that we currently estimate or that the exclusivity will be limited to the estimate.
In addition to patents and regulatory forms of exclusivity, we also market products with trademarks. Trademarks have no effect on market exclusivity for a product, but are considered to have marketing value. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and may be renewed indefinitely.
Seasonality
Consistent with the typical United States pharmaceutical industry trends, the first quarter of each year may be our lowest revenue quarter in the year. Certain products of our portfolio are also affected by seasonality. Sales of Adrenaclick® (epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector), Methylphenidate and Amphetamines tend to be higher in the third quarter of each year than in the other quarters. The seasonal impact of these particular products may affect a quarterly comparison within any fiscal year.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we have approximately 6,000 employees, of whom approximately 40% are located in the United States and approximately 60% are located outside of the United States, primarily in India.
