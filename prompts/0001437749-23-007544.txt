Silicon Carbide Ceramic Membranes for Liquid Filtration
 
For more than two decades, LiqTech has developed, manufactured, and sold innovative silicon carbide ceramic filtration technologies for liquid and gas purification. Our product portfolio consists of silicon carbide ceramic membranes for liquid purification and diesel particulate filters for emission control. We also engineer, assemble and test engineered systems for water filtration applications. Based on our continuous R&D efforts, patented technologies, and evolved production methods, we are able to produce state-of-the-art silicon carbide filters.
 
Our membranes are manufactured with a silicon carbide ceramic membrane based on our patented technology with the current portfolio consisting of:
 

● | CoMem Silicon Carbide (SiC) ceramic membranes, a unique patented technology designed as a tubular membrane. It utilizes a crossflow structure to handle high concentrations of suspended solids found in produced water from the oil and chemical industry, wastewater from industrial processes and manure filtration, and other applications. It offers consistent removal of oil and suspended solids at high throughput rates regardless of feed conditions. We offer onshore and offshore solutions and have experience within acid, chemicals and produced water streams. We believe our SiC filters are the best alternative to micro filtration and walnut shell filters due to the operational efficiencies of our SiC filters including operating cost savings, reduced installation cost, and product resilience. Our chemically inert, plug-and-play membranes are extremely hard, chemically resistant, and consisting of durable ceramics with high flux (flow). SiC membranes are stronger, harder, longer-lasting, more temperature-resistant, and recover faster than conventional ceramic or polymeric membranes;

Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) for Gas Purification
 
We offer diesel particulate filters for exhaust emission control solutions to the verified retrofit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market through our direct sales force, and distributors specializing in sales to end-users. We use a proprietary “nano wash coat” to provide a catalytic coating for anything from diesel particulate filters to catalytic converters. Our DPF products are sold worldwide under the LiqTech brand.
 
We have developed a robust silicon carbide diesel particulate filter that is especially effective for vehicles, generators, marine and non-road applications that produce a high soot load. If properly maintained, a LiqTech DPF can last as long as the application machinery or engine. Our DPFs are ideal for both on and off-road vehicles and machinery because of their strength, chemical non-reactive nature, temperature resilience, and thermal conductivity.
 
Our DPF filters can handle higher soot loads than filters that do not use a silicon carbide membrane, making them ideal for situations in which engines infrequently reach high enough temperatures to burn off the soot. Examples include: 
 

● | Garbage trucks and port vehicles; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Diesel pickup trucks not carrying a full load; 
● | Intra-city vehicles that do not reach highway speeds; 
● | Off-road construction vehicles that idle for long periods of time;
● | Marine “black carbon” exhaust applications; and 
● | Back-up generators and general “gen-set” applications; 

Liquids Filtration Systems & Solutions
 
LiqTech develops, manufactures, and sells liquid filtration systems using our patented silicon carbide technology (sometimes also referred to herein as our “Aqua Solution, SiC and HTM membranes”). Our current focus is to strengthen our position within certain industrial applications such as acid purification, metal cooling, and hydrocarbon production-derived contaminated water, which we refer to herein as “produced water”. Furthermore, we remain focused on our legacy segments within marine scrubber wastewater, pool, metal & mining, and other energy applications.
 
Our filtration systems have been used in the following applications by our clients:
 

● | Industrial Applications: We have delivered complete liquid filtration systems for aggressive fluid applications such as heavy metal removal for energy providers and water treatment systems for mining wastewater for European mining companies. Furthermore, our systems have been deployed successfully to reduce OPEX and increase product quality in acid purification applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Produced Water: Our systems can be used for the filtration of produced water, which is a byproduct of oil & gas production. The amount of produced water varies from 0.1 to 10 times the amount of oil produced. We have performed testing with major international oil & gas operators. Our solution is market-proven and applicable for onshore and offshore operations with a focus on enhanced oil recovery “EOR” for more sustainable operations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | MEG: Our silicon carbide membrane technology can be deployed in filtration systems related to monoethylene glycol ("MEG") recovery within the oil & gas industry. MEG is widely used by oil & gas producers in wellheads and pipelines to prevent hydrate formation in pipeline conditions. In deep water offshore gas production facilities, where the exposure to lower temperatures in subsea pipelines is common, MEG is used for hydrate inhibition. Together with our clients, we have demonstrated the SiC membrane technology performance and verified significant performance improvements to the MEG regeneration process when compared to other membrane technologies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Marine Scrubber Wastewater: We supply water filtration systems for marine scrubber systems that may be deployed on ships to reduce sulfur emissions stemming from heavy fuel oil (HFO) operations, allowing vessels to comply with the IMO 2020 sulfur cap.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
Our products and systems compete with other filtration technologies that are made of ceramic and polymeric materials. Most of our competitors are large industrial companies; however, we believe our patented technology allows us to produce high-quality products that provide an advantage over many of our direct and, in many cases, larger competitors. We intend to continue investing in R&D with the aim of developing new technologies and improving our existing products to strengthen our competitive advantages, retain our existing customers, and acquire new customers.
 
We believe the following strengths underpin our ability to increase revenue and profitability:
 

● | Advantages of Silicon Carbide Membranes and Filters: Our liquid filtration and diesel exhaust products utilize silicon carbide substrate and membrane technology, which have unique qualities that we believe make our products more effective than those of our competitors. Unlike filtration products made of aluminum oxide, silicon carbide membranes are chemically inert and temperature resistant. Furthermore, silicon carbide membranes exhibit a high degree of hydrophilicity (the tendency of a surface to become wet or absorb water), which results in unique high flux (and corresponding low energy consumption). Silicon carbide is also very durable, and its hardness is only surpassed by select unique material compositions such as diamonds, making it a highly desirable material for various abrasive fluids in industrial applications. As a result, we believe that such superior physical properties make our products desirable in both liquid filtration products and exhaust emission control products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Industry

Overview
 
We serve primarily two industries: the liquid filtration market and the silicon carbide ceramic membrane & diesel particulate filter (DPF) market. Our goal is to leverage our products and core technology and position our company to take advantage of favorable market trends.
Liquid Filtration Systems and Aftermarket
 
Water is essential to life on earth, and clean water shortages are affecting billions of people. Today, 2.2 billion people lack safely managed drinking water, and 3 billion people worldwide lack basic handwashing facilities at home. In addition, more than 700 million people could be displaced due to water scarcity (according to the UN). According to the World Health Organization, approximately 361,000 children die every year due to unsafe water and lack of basic sanitation. In this context, our company seeks to deploy our unique filtration systems across industries to help unlock a more sustainable future with lower resource consumption and equally important more efficient and responsible operations, with the objective of creating both economic value and environmental benefits.
 
According to relevant industry research published in 2022, the global ceramic membrane market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4%, from $5.4 billion in 2021 to $14.3 billion in 2030. LiqTech is differentiated by what we believe is our superior SiC membrane technology and our ability to provide a complete water treatment system for select industries and applications.
 
    5 

  

Our industrial applications within industrial wastewater e.g., metal cooling, diary and biomass, and more specific applications such as phosphoric acid purification, represent a core part of our strategic growth agenda. We seek to leverage our innovative and patented SiC ceramic membrane technology by designing and deploying our filtration systems into complex and demanding industrial applications where our clients can benefit from both operational benefits and directly value creation. Recent deployments have showcased attractive returns on investment, as our solutions yield both improved end product characteristics, lower operational costs and higher output. We are currently focused on validating our value proposition and future market potential in order to more accurately assess the commercial potential within each industrial end-market segment. The growth within the global industrial water & wastewater treatment market is projected to reach $7.7 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 11.2% from 2021, based on relevant industry research.
 
Generally, we also see a growing global demand for higher-quality re-injection water from unconventional oil & gas productions. In addition, we see tightening water discharge legislation, increasing water usage (more water produced per barrel of oil), and the introduction of Enhanced Oil Recovery (“EOR”) techniques as key growth drivers in this end market. Furthermore, we have recently worked closely with industry partners to help validate and accelerate new applications within the global oil & gas industry as evidenced by the recent application for monoethylene glycol (MEG) recovery in the Mediterranean. The tightening water discharge legislation and increased focus on EOR remain a problem for conventional treatment and filtration technologies; however, our SiC filters can mitigate these challenges, and we believe the increasing demand for technology-based solutions within the global oil & gas industry represents a favorable market trend for our business as operators continue to focus on extending well lifetime and reduce operating costs and energy consumption.
 
The market for marine water filtration systems is dependent on the development of new regulations for sulfur and ballast water emissions. Industry experts estimate that 8,000-10,000 ships will be retrofitted with a scrubber water treatment system over the next five years. At the end of 2019, the industry statistics note that nearly 4,000 ships have installed or ordered scrubbers (according to the DNV GL report of March 2020), although most installations were open-loop scrubbers, which discharge the wash water directly into the sea. The addressable market for LiqTech is focused on closed-loop scrubbers, where the scrubber wash water is routed through our filtration system to remove sulfur and other particulates, and the clean water is then recycled as wash water. We believe that a portion of the open-loop scrubbers already installed eventually will be converted to closed-loop, thus resulting in a larger market for our solution, albeit with timing uncertainty considering the delayed regulatory stimulus and local port bans. To position our company for future growth of marine scrubbers, we engage with scrubber equipment suppliers, ship owners/operators, and shipyards. Furthermore, we present our water treatment and filtration solutions at marine conferences and trade shows, while also through digital marketing.
 
In addition to our industrial, oil & gas, and marine applications, our company offers industry-leading commercial pool filtration systems globally through distributors and local partners. Based on more than 20 years of experience in the filtration industry, we have thoroughly developed a superior and cost-effective industrial pool filter system with a smaller footprint, lower chlorine consumption, and higher quality of water filtration. Conventional technologies use large amounts of chemicals for disinfection, whereas our superior commercial pool system reduces chemical consumption. We believe our offering is uniquely positioned to unlock future growth in the context of the global focus on ESG, considering that our commercial pool application delivers safe, clean, and clear water to our clients with lower energy consumption and reduced lifecycle costs. The market for commercial pools in Europe alone was $1.5 billion in 2021 and expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2021 to 2028 based on relevant industry research published in June 2022.
 
Furthermore, our company has recently intensified its focus on aftermarket sales through service & maintenance agreements and general sale of spare parts to our clients and partners. We intend to leverage the installed base of our filtration systems delivered and commissioned over the last decade by engaging with both new and existing clients to develop a closer and more comprehensive partnership structure and ultimately bundle our filtration system and aftermarket offering. We believe the aftermarket segment represents robust growth fundamentals as clients and technology providers are increasingly focused on unlocking value through close collaboration, for which service and maintenance will yield improved customer satisfaction and growth.

Silicon Carbide Ceramic Membrane & Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Market
 
Our legacy business related to the provision of DPF filters is expected to continue growing across Asia, Europe, and the United States as regulators require diesel engines to comply with new and more stringent environmental rules and regulation. In Europe, for example, cities in Germany, and the Benelux countries are enforcing increasingly stringent requirements for diesel engines to include DPF filters, with the same trend also taking place in select Asian countries.
 
Furthermore, our proprietary DPF technology has paved the way for new market opportunities such as black carbon reduction in the marine industry, where our solutions allow both ocean-going and inland marine vessels to comply with current and future regulatory thresholds as defined by both IMO and regional regulators.
 
According to an industry publication (Diesel Particulate Filter – Global Market Outlook (2017-2026)), dated January 16 2019, the global market for new DPF filters manufactured by OEMs is expected to increase approximately 13% per year from 2017 to 2026. Diesel emissions consist of several toxic gases and particles: particulate matter (soot), carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons. Soot has been linked to a variety of human health problems. Reducing diesel emissions will have both health and social benefits, along with reduced costs.
 
In response to these health impacts, governments have been implementing legislation to regulate emissions from diesel engines. California implemented the Diesel Risk Reduction Plan, and New York City implemented binding directives for the retrofitting of buses, garbage trucks, and construction machines. In the European Union, Directive EC 715/2007 of June 20, 2007, defines particle count limits for certain cars and light utility vehicles. Also, low emission zones have been implemented locally in various places in Europe, creating a patchwork of regulation.
 
The Asian markets have shown an improved standard of living due to financial growth, which has led to increased sales of vehicles in the region. At the same time, pollution in major cities has reached high particulate matter levels. As a result, for example, the Chinese government has introduced additional regulations, including new emissions standards, faster than previously anticipated. We also believe the high pollution levels will increase the need to retrofit existing vehicles.
 
Historically, our business has predominantly sold our ceramic membranes through integrated filtration system offerings with SiC, HTM, and Aqua Solution membranes embedded in the filtration systems offered to our partners, distributors, and end clients. Recently, however, our company has intensified its focus on the direct sale of SiC and HTM membranes products to clients and integrators across jurisdictions to directly access the global market for ceramics membrane solutions in the context of the growing need for clean water and responsible handling of industrial wastewater, while also placing value-enhancing applications across core industrial processes such as acid purification, enhances oil recovery, etc. Our company will work to accelerate market penetration and further validate perspectives on market potential and value proposition through detailed market studies and associated estimates of total addressable markets.

Research and Development
 
We have nine (9) full-time employees that are primarily engaged in R&D activities pertaining to the development of technology and intellectual property rights related to silicon carbide product forms, applications, and manufacturing processes.
Manufacturing
 
We currently manufacture our membrane and DPF products in Ballerup, Denmark (Copenhagen area). We assemble our water treatment systems in Hobro, Denmark, and we manufacture plastic products in our facility located in Aarhus, Denmark. We plan to expand and optimize our production capacity within the existing facilities with further support from existing partnerships across Europe, Middle East, Asia, and Europe.
Raw Materials and Components
 
The main raw materials we use in our manufacturing processes are silicon carbide, steel, pumps, electrical components, plastic, platinum, and palladium. We purchase these commodities from various sources generally based upon availability and price.
Sales, Marketing and Business Intelligence
 
Our products and services are sold both directly and indirectly to end clients across multiple jurisdictions and end-markets through direct sales, systems integrators, distributors, agents, and partners.
 
Our Company initially focused on selling DPF filters to the automotive industry to reduce exhaust gas emissions in diesel engines. In 2014, we acquired Provital Solutions, a Danish filtration system manufacturing company, which enabled our Company to broaden our offering of products and systems for ceramics filters, SiC membranes and modular liquid filtration systems. The liquid filtration systems business has become a highly complementary offering to our existing SiC membrane and DPF business.
 
We plan to actively market our existing products to new customers as we penetrate new markets and optimize our manufacturing capacity. As of March 2023, we employed eleven (11) full-time sales, marketing and strategy people in addition to partnership and distribution agents. We promote our products through direct sales to potential customers and marketing activities such as participation in tradeshows and exhibitions, with a heavy focus on digital marketing.
 
In certain instances, our products are delivered to the end customer through system integrators. These system integrators use our filtration products and membranes in larger filtration systems, which eventually are installed in systems used by the end customer. Due to legislative regulation, system integrators are often required by the end customers to receive approval for their systems, including the components used in such systems, which requires significant time and expense. As a result, we believe that certain system integrators using our products will not replace our filters with competitive products unless there are compelling reasons to do so. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have one issued patent in the United States that we co-own with a third party, two issued patents in Denmark, three issued foreign patents (Germany, China, and South Korea) that we co-own with a third party, and one pending European patent application that we co-own with a third party. The United States patent that we co-own is generally effective for 20 years from the filing date (July 8, 2004) of the earliest U.S. or international application to which it claims priority. The scope and duration of each of our foreign patents vary in keeping with local laws. On July 7, 2014, we obtained a new Danish patent application related to our silicon carbide membrane technology.
 
    8 

  

We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Trade secrets, however, can be difficult to protect. We may not be able to maintain our technology or know-how as trade secrets, and competitors may develop or acquire equally valuable or more valuable technology or know-how related to the manufacture of comparable silicon carbide products. We also seek to protect our confidential and proprietary information, in part, by requiring all employees, consultants, and business partners to execute confidentiality and/or nondisclosure agreements upon the commencement of any employment, consulting arrangement, or engagement with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential and proprietary information developed by the employee, consultant, or business partner, or made known to the employee, consultant, or business partner by us, during the course of the relationship with us and thereafter, be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties.
 
We also believe that having distinctive names is an important factor in marketing our products and therefore use trademarks to brand some of our products. As of March 2023, we had three trademark registrations in China and four trademark registrations in Denmark (AQUA SOLUTION, CoMem, CDPX, and FUTURE FILTRATION). We are also in the process of proactively renewing and developing new trademarks in select geographical areas.
 
Government Regulation
 
We do not believe that we are subject to any special governmental regulations affecting our products in the countries in which we operate, although we are subject to numerous health and safety laws and regulations. We actively seek to maintain a safe, healthy, and environmentally friendly workplace for all of our employees and other stakeholders.
Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the handling, storage, disposal, and release of waste and hazardous substances. It is our policy to comply with all applicable environmental requirements at each of our facilities. From time to time, we have identified minor environmental compliance issues at our facilities. To date, compliance with environmental matters has not had a material effect upon the Company’s capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position.
 
We believe that, due to the constant focus on the environment, clean air, and clean water standards throughout the world, more stringent regulations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere around the world are likely as governmental agencies seek to improve standards required for certification of products intended to promote clean air and water. In the event our products fail to meet these changing standards, some or all our products may become obsolete, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and long-term prospects.
 
Competition

Our products compete with other filters that are made using polymer, silicon carbide ceramic, and aluminum oxide membranes. Most of our competitors are large industrial companies; however, we believe our patented technology, manufacturing know-how, and trade secrets allow us to produce high-quality products that provide an advantage over most of our competitors, many of which have greater financial, technological, manufacturing and personnel resources. We intend to continue to devote resources to the development of new technologies and the improvement of our products to retain existing customers and acquire new customers.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2022 we had 105 employees, including 69 in production, 14 in administration, 9 in research and development, 11 in sales, marketing and strategy, and 2 in executive management.
 
Certain employees in Denmark are represented by workers’ councils that have collective bargaining agreements. With the exception of such Danish employees, no other employees are members of a labor union or are represented by workers’ councils that have collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
