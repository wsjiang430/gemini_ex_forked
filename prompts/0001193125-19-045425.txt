General 
 The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (Boston Beer or the Company) is a high-end alcoholic beverage company and one of the largest craft brewers in the United States. In fiscal 2018, Boston Beer sold approximately 4.3 million barrels of its proprietary products. During 2018, the Companys brands include Samuel Adams®, Twisted Tea®, Angry Orchard® Hard Cider, and Truly Hard Seltzer, formerly marketed as Truly Spiked & Sparkling®, as well as craft beer brands brewed by its subsidiary A&S Brewing Collaborative LLC and its affiliates (A&S Brewing). 
 Boston Beer produces alcohol beverages including malt beverages (beers), hard cider and hard seltzer at Company-owned breweries and its cidery and under contract arrangements at other brewery locations. The Company-owned breweries include breweries located in Boston, Massachusetts (the Boston Brewery), Cincinnati, Ohio (the Cincinnati Brewery) and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania (the Pennsylvania Brewery). The A&S Brewing breweries are located in Los Angeles, California (the Angel City Brewery), Miami, Florida (the Concrete Beach Brewery) and Brooklyn, New York (the Coney Island Brewery). The Company owns an apple orchard and cidery located in Walden, New York (the Orchard and Cidery). 
 The Companys principal executive offices are located at One Design Center Place, Suite 850, Boston, Massachusetts 02210, and its telephone number is (617) 368-5000.
Industry Background 
 Before Prohibition, the United States beer industry consisted of hundreds of small breweries that brewed full-flavored beers. After the end of Prohibition, most domestic brewers shifted production to less flavorful, lighter beers, which use lower-cost ingredients, and can be mass-produced to take advantage of economies of scale in production. This shift towards mass-produced beers coincided with consolidation in the beer industry that by 2008 ultimately resulted in the two largest breweries, Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) and MillerCoors LLC (MillerCoors), comprising over 90% of all United States domestic beer production, excluding imports. During the last twenty years the number of breweries in the United States has increased significantly from approximately 1,500 in 2008 to over 7,000 in 2018. Most of these new breweries are craft (small and independent) brewers. The rise of craft breweries along with the growth of imported beers has resulted in a significant decline in the volume of the two largest breweries who now comprise approximately 70% of all United States domestic beer production, excluding imports. 
 The Companys beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers are primarily positioned in the market for High End beer occasions. The Company defines High End beers, including craft beers, domestic specialty beers, most imported beer, hard cider, flavored malt beverages and hard seltzer that are called for by a High End beer drinker occasion. High End beers and beer occasions (the High End category) are determined by higher price, quality, image and taste, as compared with regular domestic beers. This category has seen high single-digit compounded annual growth over the past ten years. The Company believes that the High End category is positioned to increase market share, as drinkers continue to trade up in taste and quality. Boston Beer is one of the largest suppliers in the High End category in the United States. The Company estimates that in 2018 the High End category percentage volume growth was approximately 8%, with the craft beer category volume growth approximately 5%, and total beer category volume essentially flat to slightly down. The Company believes that the High End category is now over 30% of the United States beer market. 
 The domestic beer industry, excluding the High End category, has experienced a decline in shipment volume over the last twenty years. The Company believes that this decline is due to declining alcohol consumption per person in the population, drinkers trading up to drink high quality, more flavorful beers, health and wellness trends and increased competition from wine and spirits companies.

 The Companys Twisted Tea products compete within the flavored malt beverage (FMB) category of the beer industry (and the Companys Twisted Tea products are included in generic references to the Companys beers in this report). The Company believes that the FMB category comprises approximately 5% of United States beer consumption and that the volume comprising the FMB category grew approximately 13% in 2018. This category is highly competitive due to, among other factors, the presence of large brewers and spirits companies in the category and a fast pace of product innovation. 
 The Companys Angry Orchard ciders compete within the hard cider category that has similar characteristics to the beer industry. The Company believes that the hard cider category comprises less than 1% of United States beer consumption. This category is small and highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors, as well as many small regional and local hard cider companies. The hard cider category experienced very fast growth until a slowing in 2015, a decline in 2016 and 2017, and a return to growth in 2018. The Company estimates the category volume grew approximately 8% in 2018. 
 The Truly Hard Seltzer brand competes within the hard seltzer category that has similar characteristics to the beer industry for reporting and regulatory purposes. This category is small, growing rapidly in its early stages of development over the last 3 years, highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors. The Company believes that the hard seltzer category comprises less than 1% of United States beer consumption, but estimates that category volume grew approximately 200% in 2018. 
 Description of Business 
 The Companys business goal is to become the leading supplier in the High End category by creating and offering high quality alcohol beverages. With the support of a large, well-trained sales organization and world-class brewers, the Company strives to achieve this goal by offering great beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers, and increasing brand availability and awareness through traditional media and digital advertising, point-of-sale, promotional programs and drinker education. 
 The Companys Beer, Hard Cider and Hard Seltzer Business 
 The Companys beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers are sold by the Companys sales force to the same types of customers and drinkers in similar size quantities, at similar price points and through substantially the same channels of distribution. These beverages are manufactured using similar production processes, have comparable alcohol content and generally fall within the same regulatory environment. 
 The Companys strategy is to create and offer a world-class variety of traditional and innovative alcohol beverages, with a focus on promoting the Samuel Adams brand, but supported by complementary brands. The Samuel Adams, Twisted Tea, Angry Orchard and Truly Hard Seltzer brands are all available nationally, while the majority of the A&S Brewing brands focus on local distribution and tap rooms. The Twisted Tea brand family has grown each year since the product was first introduced in 2001 and has established a loyal drinker following. The Angry Orchard brand family was launched in the second half of 2011 in several markets and achieved national distribution in 2012. Since 2013, Angry Orchard has been the largest selling hard cider in the United States. In 2016, the Company began national distribution of the Truly Hard Seltzer brand and it maintained its place as one of the leading brands in the hard seltzer category in 2018. The Companys A&S Brewing subsidiary currently has three brands, including Angel City®, Coney Island® and Concrete Beach®. 
 The Company sells its beverages in various packages. Kegs are sold primarily for on-premise retailers, which include bars, restaurants, stadiums and other venues. Bottles, traditional cans and sleek cans are sold primarily for off-premise retailers, which include grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores and liquor stores. 
 Samuel Adams Boston Lager® is the Companys flagship beer that was first introduced in 1984. The Samuel Adams Seasonal program of beers was originally introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These beers are 
 
4 


  brewed specifically for limited periods of time and in 2018 included Samuel Adams Cold Snap®, Samuel Adams Summer Ale, Samuel Adams OctoberFest, and Samuel Adams Winter Lager. The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Samuel Adams brand family are focused on Samuel Adams Boston Lager and the Samuel Adams Seasonal program of beers in various bottle, can and keg packages. 
 After some test launches in late 2017, the Company began the national launch in the first quarter of 2018 of Samuel Adams Sam 76, a revolutionary beer that is a uniquely flavorful and refreshing union of lager and ale. Later in 2018 and on a more limited basis, the Company launched Samuel Adams New England IPA, a hazy unfiltered IPA with citrusy hop flavor. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company launched nationally Samuel Adams New England Pale Ale, a more sessionable hazy unfiltered pale ale. Sam 76 and both the Samuel Adams New England beers will be promoted and distributed nationally in 2019 and are viewed as important innovations and opportunities for sales volume growth within the Samuel Adams brand family. 
 Certain Samuel Adams beers may be produced at select times during the year solely for inclusion in the Companys seasonal variety packs that are available nationally. During 2018, Samuel Adams Noble Pils, Samuel Adams Kellerbier, Samuel Adams Smoked Lager and Samuel Adams Coffee Black Lager were brewed and included in the Spring bottle variety packs, Samuel Adams Hefeweizen, Samuel Adams Raspberry Lemon Gose, Samuel Adams Golden Ale and Samuel Adams Pale Ale were brewed and included in Summer bottle variety packs, Samuel Adams Pumpkin Ale, Samuel Adams Black Lager, Samuel Adams Spruce Tip Lager and Samuel Adams Coffee Pale Ale were brewed and included in Fall bottle variety packs, and Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock, Samuel Adams Holiday Porter and Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig® Ale were brewed and included in Winter bottle variety packs. Additionally, beginning in 2011 the Company began limited releases of seasonal beers in various packages. In 2018, these limited seasonal release beers included Samuel Adams Porch Rocker® and Samuel Adams White Christmas. 
 The Samuel Adams Brewmasters Collection and Samuel Adams Rebel® IPA family include various styles of beer and are an important part of the Companys portfolio and heritage, but currently receive limited promotional support and distribution. The Barrel Room Collection and Limited Edition Beers and certain specialty variety packs are produced in limited quantities and are sold at higher prices than the Companys other products. The Company also releases a variety of specialty draft beers brewed in limited quantities for festivals and Beer Week celebrations and at its brewery tap rooms in both Boston, Massachusetts and Cincinnati, Ohio. 
 The Company offers nine styles of flavored malt beverages in the Twisted Tea brand family most of which are available nationally in both the United States and Canada. The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Twisted Tea brand family are focused on Twisted Tea Original and Twisted Tea Half and Half in various can packages. 
 The Company offers twelve styles of hard cider in the Angry Orchard brand family most of which are available nationally in the United States. The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Angry Orchard brand family are focused on Angry Orchard Crisp Apple and Angry Orchard Rosé in various bottle, can and keg packages. 
 The Company offers nine styles of hard seltzer in the Truly brand family most of which are available nationally in the United States. The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Truly brand family are focused on Truly Citrus Mix Pack and Truly Berry Mix Pack in sleek can packages. 
 The Company continually evaluates the performance of its various beer, hard cider and hard seltzer and the rationalization of its product line as a whole. Periodically, the Company discontinues certain styles and packages. Certain styles or brands discontinued in previous years may be produced for the Companys variety packs or reintroduced.

 Product and Packaging Innovations 
 The Company has a proven track record of innovation and building new brands and is committed to maintaining its position as a leading innovator. To that end, the Company continually tests new beers, hard ciders, hard seltzers and other alcohol beverages and may sell them under various brand labels for evaluation of drinker interest. The Boston Brewery and the Orchard, along with its other breweries and tap rooms spend significant time ideating, testing and developing alcohol beverages for the Companys potential future commercial development and evaluating ingredients and process improvements for existing beverages. 
 In 2018, the Company introduced Angry Orchard Rosé, a Truly Berry Variety Pack, Truly Wild Berry, Sam76 and Samuel Adams New England IPA. Overall in 2018, these five new product innovations are within the top product introductions in their respective categories. In 2019, the Company plans to build upon these successful innovations with three additional brands that it believes address important opportunities for High End beer occasions. These brands include 26.2 Brew from the Companys wholly owned affiliate Marathon Brewing Company, Wild Leaf Hard Tea, a craft hard tea, and Tura Alcoholic Kombucha, an alcoholic kombucha tea. The Company is in the very early stages of national launch of both 26.2 Brew and Wild Leaf and will launch Tura later in the quarter on a more limited geographical basis. 
 In 2013, the Company completed a two-year research effort to develop a beer can to improve the experience of the beer drinker who chooses to drink from a can. The features of this custom Sam can include a wider lid with an opening slightly further from the edge of the lid, an extended lip and an hourglass ridge, all of which features are believed by the Company to enhance the craft beer drinkers experience relative to a traditional beverage can. Currently, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, Samuel Adams Seasonal beers, Samuel Adams Sam 76, Samuel Adams New England IPA, Samuel Adams Rebel IPA beers and some of the A&S Brewing beers are available in this uniquely-designed can. 
 Sales, Distribution and Marketing 
 As dictated by the legal and regulatory environment, most all of the Companys sales are made to a network of approximately 375 wholesalers in the United States and to a network of foreign wholesalers, importers or other agencies (collectively referred to as Distributors). These Distributors, in turn, sell the products to retailers, such as grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores, liquor stores, bars, restaurants, stadiums and other retail outlets, where the products are sold to drinkers, and in some limited circumstances to parties who act as sub-distributors. The Company sells its products predominantly in the United States, but also has markets in Canada, Europe, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean, the Pacific Rim, Mexico, and Central and South America. 
 With few exceptions, the Companys products are not the primary brands in its Distributors portfolios. Thus, the Company, in addition to competing with other beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers for a share of the drinkers business, competes with other brewers for a share of the Distributors attention, time and selling efforts. During 2018, the Companys largest Distributor accounted for approximately 3% of the Companys net sales. The top three Distributors collectively accounted for approximately 7% of the Companys net sales. In some states and countries, the terms of the Companys contracts with its Distributors may be affected by laws that restrict the enforcement of some contract terms, especially those related to the Companys right to terminate the relationship. 
 Most products are shipped within days of packaging resulting in limited product order backlog. The Company has historically received most of its orders from domestic Distributors in the first week of a month for products to be shipped the following month and the Distributor would then carry three to five weeks of packaged inventory (usually at ambient temperatures) and three to four weeks of draft inventory. 
 In an effort to reduce both the time and temperature the Companys beers experience at Distributor warehouses before reaching the retail market, in late 2010 the Company introduced its Freshest Beer Program with domestic 
 
6 


  Distributors in several markets. The goal of the Freshest Beer Program is to work in cooperation with the Distributors to provide better on-time service, forecasting, production planning, substantially reducing Distributor inventory levels. At the close of its 2018 fiscal year, the Company had Distributors representing approximately 77% of the Companys domestic volume participating in the Program. The Company has successfully reduced the inventories of participating Distributors in the aggregate by approximately two weeks, resulting in fresher beer being delivered to retail. The Freshest Beer Program has significantly changed the ordering process for participating Distributors and has resulted in a shorter period between order placement and shipment and a resulting reduction in open orders. 
 In late 2018, in response to anticipated supply chain constraints and demand forecasts, the Company began working with certain Distributors on plans to increase Distributor inventories of certain brands during the first half of 2019 to ensure that drinker demand can be met during seasonal peaks during the summer months. The Company expects that Distributor inventories will return to levels consistent with 2018 in terms of weeks on hand in the second half of 2019. 
 Boston Beer has a sales force of approximately 410 people, which the Company believes is one of the largest in the domestic beer industry. The Companys sales organization is designed to develop and strengthen relations at the Distributor, retailer and drinker levels by providing educational and promotional programs. The Companys sales force has a high level of product knowledge and is trained in the details of the brewing and selling processes. Sales representatives typically carry samples of the Companys beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers, certain ingredients, such as hops and barley, and other promotional materials to educate wholesale and retail buyers about the quality and taste of the Companys products. The Company has developed strong relationships with its Distributors and retailers, many of which have benefited from the Companys premium pricing strategy and growth. 
 The Company also engages in media campaigns  including television, radio, digital and social media, billboards and print. These media efforts are complemented by participation in sponsorships, which currently include the Boston Red Sox, the Richard Childress Racing Team of the NASCAR Cup Series, the Kentucky Derby, the Boston Marathon, local beer festivals, industry-related trade shows and promotional events at local establishments, to the extent permitted under local laws and regulations. The Company uses a wide array of point-of-sale items (banners, neon signs, umbrellas, glassware, display pieces, signs and menu stands) designed to stimulate impulse sales and continued awareness. 
 Corporate Social Responsibility 
 In 2008, the Company launched its core philanthropic initiative, Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream®. In partnership with ACCION, one of the nations largest non-profit micro-lenders, the program supports small business owners in the food, beverage, and brewing industries through access to business capital, coaching, and new market opportunities. The goal is to help strengthen small businesses, create local jobs and build vibrant communities. Since the inception of the Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream program, the Company and ACCION have worked together to loan more than $29 million to more than 2,000 small business owners who have subsequently repaid these loans at a rate of more than 96%. Boston Beer employees, together with local business partners and community organizations, have provided coaching and mentoring to more than 11,000 business owners across the country. These efforts have helped to create or maintain more than 7,500 local jobs. 
Ingredients and Packaging 
 The Company has been successful to date in obtaining sufficient quantities of the ingredients used in the production of its beverages. These ingredients include: 
 Malt. The two-row varieties of barley used in the Companys malt are mainly grown in the United States and Canada. The 2018 North American barley crop, which will support 2019 malt needs, was generally consistent 
 
7 


  with historical long-term averages with regard to both quality and quantity, though quality from key areas in Canada was again highly variable and in some cases below long term averages. The average booked 2018 barley crop prices were comparable to historical long term averages. There has been a long-term trend of declining acres and production in North America against relatively stable malt demand. The Company purchased most of the malt used in the production of its beers from two suppliers during 2018. The Company currently has a multi-year contract with one of its suppliers and a one year agreement with the other supplier. The Company also believes that there are other malt suppliers available that are capable of supplying its needs. 
 Hops. The Company uses Noble hop varieties from Europe for many of its Samuel Adams beers and also uses hops grown in the other areas of Europe, United States, England and New Zealand. Noble hops are grown in several specific areas recognized for growing hops with superior taste and aroma properties. These noble hops include Hallertau-Hallertauer, Tettnang-Tettnanger and Spalt-Spalter from Germany and Saaz from the Czech Republic. The United States hops, grown primarily in the Pacific Northwest, namely Cascade, Simcoe®, Centennial, Chinook, Citra®, Amarillo®, and Mosaic® are used in certain Company ales and lagers, as are the Southern Hemisphere hop varieties, Galaxy and Nelson Sauvin. Traditional English hops, namely, East Kent Goldings and Fuggles, are also used in certain Company ales. Other hop sources and varieties including new experimental varieties such as HBC 566 and HBC 682 are also tested from time to time and used in certain beers. The Company uses hops in various formats including T-90 hop pellets, T-45 hop pellets and CO2 Extract. 
 The European hop crop harvested in 2018 was well below historical long term averages in both quality and quantity due to high temperatures and low precipitation. The United States hop crop harvested in 2018 was consistent with historical long term averages in quality, with an increase in overall quantity driven by expansion of planted acres in recent years. However, the demand for certain hops grown in the United States has risen dramatically due to the success and proliferation of craft brewers and the popularity of beer styles that include hop varieties grown in the United States, with the result that prices continue to rise for both spot purchases and forward contract pricing and occasionally certain United States hops are in tight supply until the next crop or beyond. 
 The Company enters into purchase commitments with ten primary hop dealers, based on the Companys projected future volumes and brewing needs. The dealers either have the hops that are committed or will contract with farmers to meet the Companys needs. The contracts with the hop dealers are denominated in Euros for the German and Czech Republic hops, in Pounds Sterling for some English hops, US Dollars for United States and some English hops and New Zealand Dollars for the New Zealand hops. The Company does not currently hedge its forward currency commitments. 
 For the hop crop harvested in 2018, the Company expects to realize less than full delivery on European hop contracts and full delivery on United States and New Zealand hop contracts. The Company attempts to maintain a one to two-year supply of essential hop varieties on-hand in order to limit the risk of an unexpected reduction in supply and procures hops needed for new beers based on its best estimate of likely short-term demand. The Company classifies hops inventory in excess of two years of forecasted usage in other long term assets. 
 The Company believes it has adequate inventory and commitments for all hop varieties. This belief is based on expected volume and beer style mix, both of which could ultimately be significantly different from what is currently planned. Variations to plan could result in hops shortages for specific beers or an excess of certain hops varieties. 
 The Company stores its hops in multiple cold storage warehouses to minimize the impact of a catastrophe at a single site. 
 Yeast. The Company uses multiple yeast strains for production of its beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers. While some strains are commercially available, other strains are proprietary. Since the proprietary strains cannot be replaced if destroyed, the Company protects these strains by storing multiple cultures of the same strain at different production locations and in several independent laboratories. 
 
8 


 Apples. The Company uses special varieties and origins of apples in its hard ciders that it believes are important for their flavor profiles. In 2018, these apples were sourced primarily from Europe and the United States and include bittersweet apples from France and culinary apples from Italy, Washington State and New York. Purchases and commitments are denominated in Euros for European apples and US Dollars for United States apples. There is limited availability of some of these apple varieties, and many outside factors, including weather conditions, growers rotating from apples to other crops, competitor demand, government regulation and legislation affecting agriculture, could affect both price and supply. The 2018 apple crop in Europe for certain regions was lower than historical long term averages, due to climate conditions. The 2018 apple crop in the United States was consistent with historical long term averages. The Company has entered into contracts to cover its expected needs for 2019 and expects to realize full delivery against these contracts. 
 In 2015, the Company purchased and opened the Cidery in Walden, NY. The Company uses the apple varieties harvested at the Orchard to experiment and develop new hard ciders for retail sales on site. 
 Other Ingredients. The Company maintains competitive sources for most of the other ingredients used in the production of its beverages. 
 Packaging Materials. The Company maintains competitive sources for the supply of certain packaging materials, such as shipping cases and glass. The Company enters into limited-term supply agreements with certain vendors in order to receive preferential pricing. In 2018, cans, crowns, and labels were each supplied by a single source; however, the Company believes that alternative suppliers are available. 
 During 2018, as the Truly brand family sleek can packages experienced significant growth, the Company experienced supply pressures on sleek cans. The demand for sleek cans in the beverage industry has significantly increased and there has been a shortage of capacity as sleek can manufacturers and sleek can contract manufacturers adjust their supply chains to accommodate this increased demand. The Company is working to add an additional supplier and increase packaging capacity to accommodate its expected needs for 2019 and currently expects to have sufficient supply and capacity to meet those needs. 
 The Company initiates bottle deposits in some states and reuses glass bottles that are returned pursuant to certain state bottle recycling laws. The Company derives some economic benefit from its reuse of returned glass bottles. The financial impact of reusing glass varies based on the costs of collection, sorting and handling and arrangements with retailers, Distributors and dealers in recycled products. There is no guarantee that the current economics relating to the use of returned glass will continue or that the Company will continue to reuse returnable bottles. 
 Quality Assurance 
 As of December 29, 2018, the Company employed over fifteen brewmasters to monitor the Companys brewing operations and control the production of its beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers both at Company-owned breweries and at the third-party breweries at which the Companys products are brewed. Extensive tests, tastings and evaluations are typically required to ensure that each batch of the Companys beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers conforms to the Companys standards. The Company has on-site quality control labs at each of the Company-owned breweries, and supports the smaller tap rooms and local breweries with additional centralized lab services. 
 With the exception of certain specialty products, the Company includes a clearly legible freshness code on every bottle, can and keg of its beers, in order to ensure that its drinkers enjoy only the freshest products. Boston Beer was the first American brewer to use this practice. 
 Production Strategy 
 During 2018, the Company brewed, fermented and packaged over 80% of its volume at breweries owned by the Company. The Company made capital investments in 2018 of approximately $55 million, most of which 
 
9 


  represented investments in the Companys breweries. These investments were made to drive efficiencies and cost reductions, support product innovation and future growth. Based on its current estimates of future volumes and mix, the Company expects to invest between $100 million and $120 million in 2019 to meet those estimates. Because actual capital investments are highly dependent on meeting demand, the actual amount spent may well be significantly different from the Companys current expectations. 
 The Pennsylvania Brewery and the Cincinnati Brewery produce most of the Companys shipment volume. The Pennsylvania Brewery is the Companys largest brewery and the Cincinnati Brewery is the primary brewery for the production of most of the Companys specialty, lower volume products and also supplies the Companys Cincinnati tap room. 
 The Boston Brewerys production is mainly for developing new types of innovative and traditional beers, and brewing and packaging beers for retail sales on site at its gift shop and tap room, and supporting draft accounts in the local market area. 
 The Ciderys production is mainly for developing new types of innovative hard ciders and fermenting and packaging ciders for retail sales on site and in the local market area. 
 Production at the A&S Brewing breweries is mainly for developing innovative and traditional beers and supporting draft accounts in the respective local market areas and providing beers for on-premise consumption at their respective tap rooms. 
 The Company carefully selects breweries and packaging facilities owned by others with (i) the capability of utilizing traditional brewing, fermenting and finishing methods and (ii) first-rate quality control capabilities throughout the process. Under its brewing and packaging arrangements with third parties, the Company is charged a service fee based on units produced at each of the facilities and bears the costs of raw materials, risk, excise taxes and deposits for pallets and kegs and specialized equipment required to produce and package the Companys beverages. The Company currently has a brewing services agreement with subsidiaries of City Brewing Company, LLC (City Brewing), to produce its products. During 2018, the Company amended the brewing services agreement to include a minimum capacity availability commitment by City Brewing. The amendment grants the Company the right to extend the agreement beyond the December 31, 2021 termination date on an annual basis through December 31, 2025. The amendment requires the Company to pay up to $4 million dollars in both 2018 and 2019 for capital improvements at City Brewing facilities. 
 The Companys International business is supplied by breweries owned by the Company and brewing and packaging agreements that include packaging bulk shipments of beer and hard cider and production under license at international locations. 
 While the Company believes that it has alternatives available to it, in the event that production at any of its locations is interrupted, severe interruptions at the Pennsylvania Brewery would be problematic, especially in seasonal peak periods. In addition, the Company may not be able to maintain its current economics if interruptions were to occur, and could face significant delays in starting up replacement production locations. Potential interruptions at breweries include labor issues, governmental actions, quality issues, contractual disputes, machinery failures, operational shut downs, or natural or unavoidable catastrophes. Also, as the brewing industry has consolidated and the Company has grown, the capacity and willingness of breweries owned by others where the Company could produce some of its beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers, if necessary, has become a more significant concern. The Company would work with available contract brewers to attempt to minimize any potential disruptions. 
 Competition 
 The High End category within the United States is highly competitive due to large domestic and international brewers and the increasing number of craft brewers in this category who distribute similar products that have 
 
10 


  similar pricing and target drinkers. The Company expects competition and innovation among domestic craft brewers to remain strong, as the number of craft brewers continues to grow. The Company estimates there are over 7,000 breweries in operation, up from approximately 1,500 operating breweries in 2008. Most of these new breweries are craft (small and independent) brewers. Also, existing craft breweries are building more capacity, adding additional local tap rooms, expanding geographically and adding more SKUs and styles. 
 Imported beers, such as Corona®, Heineken®, Modelo Especial® and Stella Artois®, continue to compete aggressively in the United States and have gained market share over the last ten years. Heineken and Constellation Brands (owner of the United States Distribution rights to Corona and Modelo Especial) may have substantially greater financial resources, marketing strength and distribution networks than the Company has. The two largest brewers in the United States, MillerCoors and AB InBev, participate actively in the High End category, both through importing and distributing foreign brands that compete in the High End category and with their own domestic specialty beers, either by developing new brands or by acquiring, in whole or part, existing craft breweries. In addition, Miller Coors Tenth and Blake and AB InBevs High End Division were formed as business units headquartered in the United States that are focused exclusively on competing in the High End category. 
 While 2018 was a relatively quiet year for acquisitions in the industry, the last few years had numerous acquisitions with the largest being AB InBevs $107 billion purchase of SAB Miller and the related sale by SAB Miller to MolsonCoors of its 58% share of the MillerCoors joint venture with MolsonCoors in 2016. There were also numerous announcements of acquisitions of or investments in craft brewers by larger breweries and private equity and other investors. The most significant in the last few years include Heinekens acquisition of Lagunitas Brewing Company for approximately $1 billion, Constellation Brands acquisition of Ballast Point Brewing & Spirits for approximately $1 billion, AB InBevs purchase of multiple craft breweries, including Elysian Brewing Company, Golden Road Brewing, Four Peaks Brewing Company, Breckenridge Brewing, Devils Backbone, Karbach and Wicked Weed and MillerCoors purchase of multiple craft breweries, including Hop Valley Brewing, Saint Archer Brewery and Revolver Brewing. AB InBev also acquired Spiked Seltzer, a previously independent hard seltzer company. 
 The Companys products also compete with other alcoholic beverages for drinker attention and consumption and the pace of innovation in the categories in which the Company competes is increasing. In recent years, wine and spirits have been competing more directly with beers. The Company monitors such activity and attempts to develop strategies which benefit from the drinkers interest in trading up, in order to position its beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers competitively with wine and spirits. 
 The Company competes with other beer and alcoholic beverage companies within a three-tier distribution system. The Company competes for a share of the Distributors attention, time and selling efforts. In retail establishments, the Company competes for shelf, cold box and tap space. From a drinker perspective, competition exists for brand acceptance and loyalty. The principal factors of competition in the market for High End beer occasions include product quality and taste, brand advertising and imagery, trade and drinker promotions, pricing, packaging and the development of innovative new products. 
 The Company distributes its products through independent Distributors who also distribute competitors products. Certain brewers have contracts with their Distributors that impose requirements on the Distributors that are intended to maximize the Distributors attention, time and selling efforts on that brewers products. These contracts generally result in increased competition among brewers as the contracts may affect the manner in which a Distributor allocates selling effort and investment to the brands included in its portfolio. The Company closely monitors these and other trends in its Distributor network and works to develop programs and tactics intended to best position its products in the market. 
 The Company has certain competitive advantages over the local and regional craft brewers, including a long history of awards for product quality, greater available resources and the ability to distribute and promote its

  products on a more cost-effective basis. Additionally, the Company believes it has competitive advantages over imported beers, including lower transportation costs, higher product quality, a lack of import charges and superior product freshness. 
 The Companys Twisted Tea product line competes primarily within the FMB category of the beer industry. FMBs, such as Twisted Tea, Smirnoff Ice®, Mikes Hard Lemonade®, Bud Light Lime® Ritas, and Redds® Apple Ale are flavored malt beverages that are typically priced competitively with High End Beers. In 2017, MolsonCoors announced plans to distribute and support Arnold Palmer Spiked, and Phusion Projects (maker of Four Loko®) announced plans to introduce John Dalys Grip It & Sip It® Hard Iced Tea. As noted earlier, this category is highly competitive due to, among other factors, the presence of large brewers and spirits companies in the category, the advertising of malt-based spirits brands in channels not available to the parent brands and a fast pace of product innovation. 
 The Companys Angry Orchard product line competes within the hard cider category. As noted earlier, this category is small and highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors, as well as many small regional and local hard cider companies. Hard ciders are typically priced competitively with High End Beers and may compete for drinkers with beer, wine, spirits, or FMBs. Some of these competitors include C&C Group PLC under the brand names Woodchuck, Magners and Hornsbys; Heineken under the brand names Strongbow; AB InBev under Stella Cidre and Virtue Cider and MillerCoors under the brand names Smith & Forge Hard Cider and Crispin Cider. In recent years, regional and local cideries including Bold Rock and Austin East Ciders have built businesses that have gained share locally at the expense of the national brands. 
 The Companys Truly Hard Seltzer beverages compete within the hard seltzer category. This category is small, in its early stages of development, highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors. Hard seltzers are typically priced competitively with High End beers and may compete for drinkers with beer, wine, spirits, or FMBs. Some of these competitors include Mikes Hard Lemonade under White Claw; ABInbev under Spiked Seltzer and Bon & Vivs; Diageo under Smirnoff Spiked Sparkling Seltzer; and MillerCoors under Henrys Hard Sparkling Water. The Company expects numerous additional entrants in the hard seltzer category during 2019 as the category continues to develop distribution and drinker awareness. 
 Regulation and Taxation 
 The alcoholic beverage industry is regulated by federal, state and local governments. These regulations govern the production, sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages, including permitting, licensing, marketing and advertising. To operate its production facilities, the Company must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and approvals from various governmental agencies, including but not limited to, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (the TTB), the Food and Drug Administration, state alcohol regulatory agencies and state and federal environmental agencies. 
 Governmental entities may levy various taxes, license fees and other similar charges and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Beginning in 2018, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Companys federal excise tax rate on beer and hard seltzer is $16 per barrel on all barrels below 6 million barrels produced annually. The top tier rate on hard cider (with alcohol by volume of 8.5% or less) is $0.226 per gallon, on hard cider (with non-qualifying fermentable fruits) is $1.07 per gallon, and on artificially carbonated wine (hard cider with high CO2 levels) is $3.30 per gallon. Prior to 2018, the federal excise tax on beer and hard seltzer was $18 per barrel, on hard cider (with alcohol by volume of 8.5% or less) was $0.226 per gallon, on hard cider (with non-qualifying fermentable fruits) was $1.07 per gallon, and on artificially carbonated wine (hard cider with high CO2 levels) was $3.30 per gallon. These lower rates for beer, hard seltzer and hard cider currently expire at the end of 2019. States levy excise taxes at varying rates based on the type of beverage and alcohol content. Failure by the Company to comply with applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations could result in higher taxes, penalties, fees and suspension or revocation of permits, licenses or approvals. While there can be no assurance that any such regulatory action would not have a material adverse

  effect upon the Company or its operating results, the Company is not aware of any infraction affecting any of its licenses or permits that would materially impact its ability to continue its current operations. 
 Trademarks 
 The Company has obtained trademark registrations with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for over 240 trademarks, including Samuel Adams®, Sam Adams®, Samuel Adams Boston Lager®, Samuel Adams Utopias®, Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream®, Angry Orchard®, Twisted Tea®, The Traveler Beer Co.®, Coney Island®, Angel City Brewery®, Concrete Beach® and Truly Spiked & Sparkling®. It also has a number of common law trademarks, including Infinium. The Samuel Adams trademark, the Samuel Adams Boston Lager trademark, the Angry Orchard trademark, the Twisted Tea trademark and other Company trademarks are also registered or have registrations pending in various foreign countries. The Company regards its Samuel Adams family of trademarks and other trademarks as having substantial value and as being an important factor in the marketing of its products. The Company is not aware of any trademark infringements that could materially affect its current business or any prior claim to the trademarks that would prevent the Company from using such trademarks in its business. The Companys policy is to pursue registration of its marks whenever appropriate and to oppose infringements of its marks through available enforcement options. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations and Operating Considerations 
 The Companys operations are subject to a variety of extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances that govern activities or operations that may have adverse effects on human health or the environment. Environmental laws, regulations or ordinances may impose liability for the cost of remediation of, and for certain damages resulting from, sites of past releases of hazardous materials. The Company believes that it currently conducts, and in the past has conducted, its activities and operations in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws, and believes that any costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. 
 As part of its efforts to be environmentally friendly, the Company has adopted a number of practices designed to reduce waste, improve recycling and utilities consumption at its breweries. The Company also continues to reuse its glass bottles returned from certain states that have bottle deposit bills. The Company believes that it benefits economically from washing and reusing these bottles, which result in a lower cost than purchasing new glass, and that it benefits the environment by the reduction in landfill usage, the reduction of usage of raw materials and the lower utility costs for reusing bottles versus producing new bottles. The economics of using recycled glass varies based on the cost of collection, sorting and handling, and may be affected by local regulation, retailer, Distributor, and glass dealer behavior. There is no guarantee that the current economics of using returned glass will continue, or that the Company will continue its current used glass practices. 
 The Company has adopted various policies and procedures intended to ensure that its facilities meet occupational health and safety requirements. The Company believes that it currently is in compliance with applicable requirements and will continue to endeavor to remain in compliance. There can be no assurances, however, that new and more restrictive requirements might not be adopted, compliance with which might have a material, adverse financial effect on the Company and its operating results, or that such policies and procedures will be consistently followed and be sufficient to prevent serious accidents. 
 Employees 
 As of December 29, 2018, the Company employed 1,543 people, of which 84 were covered by collective bargaining agreements at the Cincinnati Brewery. The collective bargaining agreements involve three labor unions, with one contract that covers 66 employees expiring in 2019, one contract expiring in 2020, and one contract expiring in 2022. The Company believes it maintains a good working relationship with all three labor
