Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapies to treat orphan diseases, with an initial focus on cardiopulmonary indications. Our lead product candidate, PB2452, is a novel reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor, which we are developing for the treatment of patients on ticagrelor who are experiencing a major bleeding event or those who require urgent surgery. We recently completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of PB2452 in healthy subjects and intend to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial in healthy older subjects in the first half of 2019. Our second product candidate, PB1046, is a once-weekly fusion protein currently in a Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. PB1046 utilizes our proprietary half-life extending elastin-like polypeptide, or ELP, technology, which also serves as the engine for our preclinical pipeline. We retain worldwide rights to all of our product candidates. 
 PB2452 is a novel recombinant human monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment, or Fab fragment, designed to reverse the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is an antiplatelet therapy widely prescribed to reduce the rates of death, heart attack and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome, or ACS, or who have previously experienced a heart attack. The American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology guidelines recognize ticagrelor as the preferred antiplatelet therapy for ACS. In 2018, ticagrelor, currently marketed by AstraZeneca plc, or AstraZeneca, under the brand names Brilinta and Brilique, had worldwide sales of $1.3 billion, an increase of 22% over 2017 sales. In the fourth quarter of 2018, ticagrelor had worldwide sales of $376 million, an increase of 26% over sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. Ticagrelor binds to platelets to prevent them from forming blood clots, which could restrict blood flow to critical organs in these patients, causing heart attacks or strokes. Due to ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity, patients on ticagrelor have an elevated risk of spontaneous bleeding. In addition, patients on ticagrelor who need urgent surgery cannot wait the recommended five days for ticagrelor’s effect to dissipate and are at increased risk of major bleeding during and after surgery. There are currently no known reversal agents approved or in clinical development for ticagrelor or any of the other antiplatelet drugs. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, PB2452 achieved immediate and complete reversal of ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity, with potential customizable duration of reversal based on the dosing regimen, which we believe has the potential to bring life-saving therapeutic benefit to these patients by increasing the safety of ticagrelor. We believe the availability of a reversal agent could expand ticagrelor’s use by mitigating concerns regarding bleeding risk and uniquely position ticagrelor as the only oral antiplatelet drug with a reversal agent.
 We recently completed a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of PB2452 in healthy subjects ages 18 to 50 who had been pre-dosed with ticagrelor. In this trial, we observed immediate and complete reversal of ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity within five minutes following initiation of infusion, and sustained reversal for over 20 hours in later dosing cohorts in which we administered PB2452 over an extended infusion period. 
 Based on our observations in our Phase 1 trial, duration of reversal may be controlled by duration of the infusion, which may allow for customization based on patient needs. There were no PB2452-related adverse events, or AEs, or serious adverse events, or SAEs, in any of the dose cohorts. We believe that the results of the Phase 1 trial support the continued development of PB2452 to treat ticagrelor patients who are experiencing a major bleeding event or those who require urgent surgery.
 We intend to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial of PB2452 in healthy older subjects in the first half of 2019 in order to evaluate safety and efficacy of the potentially therapeutic doses and dosing regimens from the Phase 1 trial in this population. Older adults exhibit more variability in drug response to ticagrelor and higher levels of baseline platelet reactivity compared to younger subjects, and they resemble the patient population most likely to be treated with ticagrelor and potentially benefit from PB2452, if approved. We intend to design the Phase 2a trial to identify the most appropriate dose and dosing regimen of PB2452 for our planned Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials.

In mid-2019, we intend to request a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, to review the clinical profile of and confirm the regulatory pathway for PB2452. Subject to discussions with the FDA, we intend to initiate a multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial of PB2452 in healthy older adults in the second half of 2019. Subject to discussions with the FDA, we intend to initiate a multi-center phase 2b clinical trial of PB2452 in healthy older subjects in the second half of 2019 and an international, multi-center phase 3 clinical trial in patients on ticagrelor who are experiencing a major bleeding event or require urgent surgery in 2020. The FDA’s accelerated approval regulations allow drugs that are being developed to treat an unmet medical need for serious conditions to be approved substantially based on evidence of an effect on a surrogate biomarker endpoint that is considered reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, rather than a clinical endpoint such as survival or irreversible morbidity. If considered appropriate by the FDA, we intend to pursue accelerated approval, which would allow us to submit a biologics license application, or BLA, prior to completion of the Phase 3 clinical trial based on biomarker data from an initial subset of the Phase 3 patients. If we were to receive accelerated approval, the completion of the Phase 3 trial would be a post-marketing commitment.
 PB1046 is being developed as a once-weekly, novel treatment for PAH, a progressive, life-threatening, orphan disease caused by vasoconstriction and structural deterioration of the pulmonary arteries, which can lead to heart failure and, eventually, death. PB1046 is a subcutaneously-injected, sustained release analogue of the native human peptide vasoactive intestinal peptide, or VIP. VIP is a neurohormone that relaxes the muscles surrounding blood vessels, causing them to dilate, which results in improved blood flow. In contrast to the currently approved therapies for PAH, which only target vasodilation, we believe that VIP also suppresses the adverse remodeling of blood vessels and increases cardiac contractility and relaxation. We believe that PB1046 has the potential to be disease-modifying and complementary to current standard of care therapies for PAH.
 We have completed two clinical trials of subcutaneously-injected PB1046 in subjects with cardiovascular diseases. In these trials, PB1046 was observed to be well tolerated, with no drug-related SAEs. In both trials, we observed that patients who received PB1046 experienced statistically significant reductions in blood pressure that were sustained for at least one week, with no reported episodes of symptomatic hypotension. We have also completed enrollment of an exploratory Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to evaluate the effects of PB1046 on pulmonary arterial pressure in PAH patients with a CardioMEMS device, an implanted hemodynamic monitor that continuously reports pulmonary arterial pressure and cardiac function. In preliminary results from this trial, we have observed reductions in pulmonary arterial pressure and increases in cardiac output, which we believe are consistent with potential beneficial effects of PB1046. We have begun dosing patients in a randomized, double-blinded, controlled Phase 2b clinical trial in approximately 60 PAH patients to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of PB1046. This clinical trial will evaluate the effects of PB1046 on pulmonary arterial pressure and exercise tolerance, including the distance the patient can walk in six minutes, which is an important clinical endpoint that the FDA has previously used as the basis for approval of other PAH drugs. We expect to report results from this trial in 2020.
 PB1046 and our preclinical product candidates are based on our proprietary ELP technology. Our ELP technology extends the circulating half-life of proteins and peptides and also provides a sustained-release mechanism, resulting in exposure of active molecules for periods of a week or longer from a single subcutaneous injection. We believe that our ELP technology enhances solubility, stability and bioavailability, provides extended drug exposure and creates product candidates that are straightforward to manufacture and administer. Our strategy is to apply our ELP technology to proteins and peptides with well-characterized therapeutic activities but suboptimal half-lives to improve their pharmacokinetics, enable their use as pharmaceutical products and allow for more convenient dosing regimens. To date, we have not observed any drug-related SAEs in any of the over 500 subjects in clinical trials of our ELP product candidates.
 We have an experienced management team that includes individuals with experience in translational research, orphan and cardiopulmonary drug discovery, development and commercialization. We are led by our Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan P. Mow, who brings more than 25 years of experience in biotechnology management, including previous executive experience at Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Corus Pharma, PathoGenesis and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

Strategy
 Our strategy is to identify, develop and commercialize therapies to treat orphan diseases, with an initial focus on cardiopulmonary indications. The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Continue to advance PB2452 through clinical development and regulatory approval. We intend to develop and commercialize PB2452 as a novel reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor. We recently completed a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of PB2452, delivered as an intravenous infusion, in healthy subjects that was designed to identify the dose and dosing regimen, determine proof of concept and evaluate the safety and tolerability of PB2452. We intend to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial of PB2452 in healthy older subjects in the first half of 2019 in order to evaluate safety and efficacy of the potential therapeutic doses and dosing regimens from the Phase 1 trial in this population. Subject to discussions with the FDA, we intend to initiate a multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial in healthy older adults in the second half of 2019. Based on a planned interim assessment of an initial subset of patients in this trial, we plan to initiate an international, multi-center Phase 3 clinical trial in patients on ticagrelor who are experiencing a major bleeding event or require urgent surgery. If considered appropriate by the FDA, we intend to pursue accelerated approval, which would allow us to submit a BLA prior to completion of the Phase 3 clinical trial based on biomarker data from an initial subset of the Phase 3 patients.

• | Continue to develop PB1046. We intend to advance PB1046 through clinical trials as a once-weekly novel treatment for PAH that is vasodilatory, potentially disease-modifying and complementary to the current standard of care therapies. We are currently conducting a Phase 2b clinical trial of PB1046 and expect to report results from this trial in 2020. Based on the results of this trial, we intend to advance this product candidate into Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of PAH.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broaden the potential therapeutic applications of PB1046. Due to improvements in pharmacokinetics that we have observed with our ELP technology, we believe that the therapeutic potential of VIP can be applied to a variety of other orphan indications. Preclinical data suggest PB1046 may have clinical benefit in cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, or DMD, heart failure and other cardiomyopathies and in cystic fibrosis. As such, we intend to strategically broaden the therapeutic applications of PB1046 by exploring its development in additional indications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our ELP technology platform to expand our development pipeline. We believe that our ELP technology enhances solubility, stability and bioavailability, provides extended drug exposure and creates product candidates that are straightforward to manufacture and administer. As such, we plan to utilize our platform to identify product candidates for additional orphan indications. We intend to apply our ELP technology to improve the pharmacokinetics of proteins and peptides with well-characterized therapeutic activities but suboptimal half-lives, in order to improve their pharmacokinetics, enable their use as pharmaceutical products and allow for more convenient dosing regimens.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercialize our product candidates. We have entered into exclusive license agreements with AstraZeneca for PB2452 and Duke University for our ELP technology pursuant to which we retain worldwide commercial rights to our product candidates. If approved in the United States, we intend to commercialize PB2452 independently, and we may either commercialize PB1046 independently or in collaboration with a partner. As we advance towards regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we intend to establish a focused marketing and sales infrastructure. We may also explore collaborations or partnerships to commercialize PB2452 and PB1046 outside of the United States.

Pipeline
 Our pre-clinical and clinical-stage pipeline is set forth below:
 
PB2452: Antiplatelet Therapy Reversal Agent for Ticagrelor
 Our lead product candidate, PB2452, is a novel ticagrelor reversal agent, which we are developing for the treatment of patients on ticagrelor who are experiencing a major bleeding event or who require urgent surgery. We recently completed a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of PB2452, delivered as an intravenous infusion, in healthy subjects that was designed to identify the dose and dosing regimen, determine proof of concept and evaluate the safety and tolerability of PB2452. We intend to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial in healthy older subjects in the first half of 2019.
Background on Acute Coronary Syndrome
 ACS describes a range of conditions associated with sudden reduced blood flow to the heart, including unstable angina and myocardial infarction, or heart attack. ACS is caused by the inappropriate formation of clots in the coronary arteries. These blood clots are made up primarily of platelets, small lens-shaped cells found in the blood that normally aggregate at sites of injury to help stop bleeding. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 790,000 Americans have a heart attack every year, and heart attacks are a leading cause of death in the developed world.
 The primary treatment for ACS is the use of antiplatelet drugs to prevent the worsening of existing clots or to reduce the formation of additional clots. These clots can occur in the heart or in stents that are placed in the blocked coronary artery to keep the blood vessel open or elsewhere in the body. Without antiplatelet drugs, patients are at a significantly increased risk of recurrent heart attacks, stroke and death. The standard of care for ACS patients is dual antiplatelet therapy, or DAPT, which is a combination of aspirin and an inhibitor of a specific receptor found on platelets known as the P2Y12 receptor. This combination is started after a patient experiences a heart attack or other manifestation of ACS and has been shown to significantly reduce platelet aggregation and clot formation and reduce the frequency of recurrent heart attacks, stroke and death.
 While the antiplatelet drugs used in DAPT have proven effective at improving overall outcomes in ACS patients, their suppression of blood clotting increases patients’ risk of bleeding. Bleeding events in patients on antiplatelet therapy, which can occur spontaneously or as a result of injury or surgery, are classified as minor or major. In the 18,000-patient clinical trial, Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes, or PLATO, conducted by AstraZeneca, ticagrelor was shown to be superior to the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel, marketed under the brand name Plavix, in reducing recurrent heart attack, stroke and death in patients with ACS. However, in both treatment groups, 11% to 12% of patients in the trial suffered major bleeding events, and in 5.8% of patients, these major bleeding events were fatal or life-threatening. The causes of bleeding varied in the trial population. In approximately 3% of the patients on ticagrelor, the major bleeding events were spontaneous and not related to any medical 
 6


procedure, whereas approximately 9% of patients on ticagrelor developed major bleeding that was related to procedures like coronary artery bypass surgery, or CABG. Although the trial protocol recommended that patients who needed CABG stop taking ticagrelor for one to three days prior to surgery, nearly half of all ticagrelor patients needed surgery urgently and could not wait the up to three days for ticagrelor’s effect to dissipate so normal blood clotting could be restored. Overall, up to 80% of patients who underwent CABG surgery in the trial suffered a major or life-threatening bleeding event related to the surgery, and for those who needed urgent surgery and could not wait three days for the effects of ticagrelor to dissipate, approximately 50% experienced a fatal or life-threatening bleeding event. While some of this risk was likely associated with patients’ underlying conditions, the overall bleeding risk is significantly increased by antiplatelet drugs, and the current U.S. and European prescribing information for ticagrelor suggests suspension of ticagrelor treatment for five days and seven days, respectively, prior to surgery.
 Despite the increased bleeding risk, antiplatelet drugs, along with anticoagulant drugs which are used to prevent clots in veins, represent some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the United States due to their lifesaving effects. While both of these classes of drugs increase the risk of bleeding, reversal agents have been developed for anticoagulant drugs, but to date, no reversal agents exist for antiplatelet drugs. In the absence of a reversal agent, physicians have limited treatment options, and sometimes administer platelet transfusions, which are unproven in this setting. The ability to quickly reverse the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor and restore normal clotting would increase its safety, both in instances of major bleeding as well as in situations where surgical or other medical interventions associated with bleeding are urgently needed.
 Background on Antiplatelet Drugs
 The three oral antiplatelet P2Y12 receptor antagonist drugs prescribed in DAPT are clopidogrel, marketed under the brand name Plavix, prasugrel, marketed under the brand name Effient, and ticagrelor, marketed under the brand names Brilinta and Brilique. Unlike clopidogrel and prasugrel that permanently bind to and inhibit the target receptors on platelets, ticagrelor binds to the P2Y12 receptor in a transient manner, quickly cycling on and off the receptor. We believe this transient binding of ticagrelor presents a unique opportunity to develop a specific reversal agent for ticagrelor, whereas the permanent binding of the other drugs to the receptor precludes a reversal agent from being developed.
 Ticagrelor is considered the best-in-class P2Y12 antiplatelet agent because it has demonstrated superior efficacy compared to clopidogrel. In 2017, ticagrelor accounted for 17% of new P2Y12 antiplatelet prescriptions in the United States. In 2018, ticagrelor had worldwide sales of $1.3 billion, an increase of 22% over 2017 sales. Ticagrelor has achieved this level of market share despite the availability of generic versions of clopidogrel and prasugrel. We believe ticagrelor growth is being driven in part by treatment guidelines from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology that recognize ticagrelor as the preferred antiplatelet treatment for ACS. We believe that the availability of a reversal agent could further drive the use of ticagrelor by making it the only reversible oral P2Y12 antiplatelet treatment, thereby conferring a possible safety benefit over the other agents. Furthermore, based on the growth of clopidogrel prescriptions after the introduction of a generic form of that drug, we believe ticagrelor prescriptions could grow significantly after its patents expire and generic competition drives prices down to similar levels as other P2Y12 antiplatelet therapies.
 Our Solution: PB2452
 PB2452 is a human Fab fragment that binds to ticagrelor with high affinity and specificity to reverse ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity. We believe that the availability of PB2452 may further differentiate ticagrelor from other P2Y12 receptor antagonists by providing for better clinical management of the balance between the desired antiplatelet effect and prevention or control of bleeding. We exclusively licensed PB2452 from MedImmune Limited, or MedImmune, a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca.

PB2452 Background
 Ticagrelor works by binding to the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, thereby preventing adenosine diphosphate, or ADP, from causing platelet aggregation. Ticagrelor binds transiently to the P2Y12 receptor quickly cycling on and off, allowing PB2452 to bind to free ticagrelor, thereby preventing ticagrelor’s inactivation of the receptor and removing ticagrelor from circulation. With ticagrelor removed, ADP can once again activate the P2Y12 receptor and induce platelet aggregation. This activity is illustrated below.
 Mechanism of action of ticagrelor and its reversal by PB2452
 

PB2452 binds to ticagrelor with an affinity that is approximately 100 times stronger than ticagrelor’s affinity for the P2Y12 receptor. This high affinity enables PB2452 to bind to free ticagrelor, resulting in an immediate reversal of ticagrelor’s effect and restoration of platelet activity.
 Clinical Development of PB2452
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial
 We recently completed a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of PB2452, delivered as an intravenous infusion, in healthy subjects pre-dosed with ticagrelor that was designed to identify the target dose, determine proof of concept and evaluate the safety and tolerability of PB2452. In the trial, we observed that PB2452 immediately and completely reversed the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor. We conducted this trial pursuant to an investigational new drug, or IND, application that we sponsored and that became effective in March 2018. In March 2019, the full results from this trial of PB2452 were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
 Our Phase 1 clinical trial enrolled 64 subjects across 10 dose cohorts. Based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from the early dose cohorts in the trial, we adjusted the intravenous infusion of PB2452 to identify the optimal dose and dosing regimen for future trials and for the target patient populations. The initial three cohorts of subjects were dosed with 30-minute intravenous infusions of PB2452 alone in order to assess pharmacokinetics and safety. Subsequent cohorts were pre-dosed with the standard clinical regimen of ticagrelor for two days prior to administration of PB2452 to enable direct assessment of reversal of ticagrelor’s inhibition of platelet aggregation using platelet function assays. There were no PB2452-related AEs or SAEs in any of the dose cohorts.

In cohorts 5 and 6, which were the first cohorts in which potentially pharmacodynamically active doses of PB2452 were administered, we saw immediate and complete reversal of ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity based upon restoration of platelet function. In 11 out of 12 subjects, platelet function was restored at the first measured time point at the end of the 30-minute infusion. The duration of reversal varied from approximately one to four hours depending upon the dose level and subject, with longer duration at higher doses. In cohort 7, we modified the dosing regimen to deliver a total dose of 18 g, with 3 g delivered in the first five minutes of infusion, followed by 15 g delivered at a constant rate over an additional 7 hours and 55 minutes. In cohort 7, we observed that all subjects achieved complete and sustained restoration of platelet function within two hours after the start of infusion. The duration of reversal in cohort 7 lasted approximately 16 hours from the start of the infusion as measured by restoration of platelet activity.
 In cohorts 8, 9 and 10, the dosing regimen of PB2452 was further refined to achieve both a more rapid onset of reversal and a longer duration of reversal compared to earlier cohorts. We administered a total dose of 18 g, with the initial 6 g delivered as a bolus in cohorts 8, 9 and 10. The remaining 12 g was administered after the initial bolus for an additional 12 to 16 hours in cohorts 8, 9 and 10. In each of these cohorts, we observed both immediate and complete reversal within the first five minutes following initiation of infusion and a sustained duration of reversal of over 20 hours. We intend to further evaluate the dose and dosing regimens observed in these cohorts in future clinical trials.
 Future Clinical Development Plans
 We intend to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial of PB2452 in healthy older subjects in the first half of 2019 in order to evaluate safety and efficacy of PB2452 in this population. Older adults may exhibit more variability in drug response to ticagrelor and potentially higher levels of baseline platelet reactivity compared to younger subjects, and they resemble the patient population most likely to be treated with ticagrelor who could potentially benefit from PB2452, if approved. We anticipate that this trial will be a randomized, double blind, sequential, four-cohort, single dose trial. We intend to design the Phase 2a trial to identify the most appropriate dose and dosing regimen of PB2452 for our planned Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials.
 In mid-2019, we intend to request a meeting with the FDA to review the clinical profile of PB2452 and confirm our later phase development plans. Subject to discussions with the FDA, we intend to initiate a multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial in the second half of 2019 in healthy older subjects aged 50 to 80 who have been pre-dosed with ticagrelor in order to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the dose and dosing regimen of PB2452 established in our Phase 1 and Phase 2a clinical trials. Like the Phase 2a trial, these subjects will be enrolled in the Phase 2b trial because they are closer in age to the patient population most likely to be treated with ticagrelor and potentially benefit from PB2452. We expect that the trial will be conducted with a pre-specified interim analysis after an initial subset of subjects has been treated with PB2452.
 Based upon confirmation of the dose and dose regimen in healthy older subjects, we intend to initiate a multi-center Phase 3 clinical trial designed to assess the effectiveness of PB2452 as a reversal agent in patients on ticagrelor who are experiencing a major bleeding event or who require urgent surgery. The FDA’s accelerated approval regulations allow drugs that are being developed to treat an unmet medical need for serious conditions to be approved substantially based on evidence of an effect on a surrogate biomarker endpoint that is considered reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, rather than a clinical endpoint such as survival or irreversible morbidity. If considered appropriate by the FDA, we intend to pursue accelerated approval of PB2452, which would allow us to submit a BLA prior to completion of the Phase 3 clinical trial based on restoration of platelet aggregation as a biomarker in an initial subset of the Phase 3 patients. If we were to receive accelerated approval, the completion of the Phase 3 clinical trial would likely be a post-marketing commitment.

PB2452 Preclinical Studies
 In preclinical studies conducted by AstraZeneca, it was observed that PB2452 rapidly removed free ticagrelor and restored normal platelet aggregation and normal bleeding time. In a preclinical model of pigs pre-dosed with ticagrelor and aspirin, circulating levels of ticagrelor dropped by over 100-fold when measured five minutes after the administration of PB2452 and remained below the limit of quantitation for at least four hours. It was further observed in this model that dosing with ticagrelor and aspirin resulted in a 90% reduction in platelet aggregation. A single administration of PB2452 reversed and restored over 50% of ADP-induced platelet aggregation activity within five minutes and over 80% in one hour.
 
It was also observed that PB2452 reduced bleeding that had previously increased due to the presence of ticagrelor. In mice pre-dosed with ticagrelor, bleeding was initiated by a tail cut and bleeding time and total blood loss were measured. Mice treated with ticagrelor had a 4.3-fold increase in median blood loss and a 1.7-fold increase in median bleeding time versus untreated control mice. A single administration of PB2452 reduced circulating levels of free ticagrelor below the limit of quantification and blood loss and bleeding time were reduced to levels that were not significantly different to the untreated control group.
 PB1046 for the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
 We are developing our second product candidate, PB1046, as a once-weekly novel treatment for PAH. PB1046 is based on our proprietary ELP half-life extension technology. We are currently conducting a Phase 2b clinical trial in PAH patients to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of PB1046. We have received two orphan drug designations for PB1046 from the FDA, one for the treatment of PAH and a second for cardiomyopathy associated with DMD. In February 2018, we received Small Business Innovation Research, or SBIR, grants from the National Institutes of Health in an aggregate amount of $2.8 million to support the clinical development of PB1046 for the treatment of PAH for the period from February 17, 2018 to July 31, 2020. In connection with the SBIR grants, the U.S. government will receive a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use any technology we develop under such grants. As of December 31, 2018, we had recognized $0.7 million of grant revenue under the SBIR grants.
 Background on PAH
 PAH is a progressive and life-threatening orphan disease with no known cure. Common symptoms, which worsen as the disease progresses, include shortness of breath, fatigue, angina, fainting, light headedness and abdominal distension. The disease is caused by abnormal constriction and adverse remodeling of the arteries and is characterized by high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, the blood vessels leading from the heart to the lungs. This pressure restricts blood circulation through the lungs resulting in poor oxygenation, abnormal strain on the heart’s right ventricle and underfilling of the left ventricle. Over time, the remodeling worsens as inflammatory cells are recruited. This leads to tissue scarring and fibrosis, which results in severe restriction of blood flow, increasing the risk of developing life-threatening blood clots, heart failure and premature death.
 The clinical severity of PAH is classified according to a system originally developed for heart failure by the New York Heart Association and then modified by the World Health Organization for patients with PAH, ranging from functional class I (no symptoms) through functional class IV (severe symptoms). Most standard of care therapy is initiated in patients who have progressed to class II or beyond.
 According to the Pulmonary Hypertension Association, there are approximately 30,000 patients diagnosed with PAH in the United States. There are several approved therapies for PAH, and patients initially start treatment with a combination of two oral therapies. While advances in the treatment of PAH over the last two decades have markedly improved median survival from 2.8 years to approximately 9 years after diagnosis, PAH patients still face significant burdens from their disease and premature death. We estimate, based on publicly disclosed product sales data, that 2013 combined global sales for PAH therapies were approximately $4.5 billion. Product sales have expanded by more than 30% since 2013 and continue to grow.

Limitations of Current Therapies for PAH
 There is currently no cure for PAH. The three classes of currently approved drugs for the treatment of PAH are all systemic vasodilators that directly modulate vasoconstrictive or vasodilatory pathways. These currently approved therapies for PAH focus on three distinct molecular pathways: the endothelin pathway, the nitric oxide pathway and the prostacyclin pathway. The classes of drugs that target these three pathways are:
  
• | Endothelin Receptor Antagonists. Endothelin receptor antagonists work by blocking the action of endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor, thereby increasing blood flow to the lungs. These drugs, which are delivered orally, include bosentan and macitentan, marketed by Actelion as Tracleer and Opsumit, and ambisentan, marketed by Gilead as Letairis.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nitric Oxide Pathway Modulators. Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring molecule that is widely recognized as important in a number of biological processes. Nitric oxide causes blood vessels to relax and widen, resulting in an increase in blood flow. Oral drugs such as sildenafil, marketed by Pfizer as Revatio, and tadalafil, marketed by United Therapeutics as Adcirca, are phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors that work by enhancing the activity of naturally occurring nitric oxide.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prostacyclin Analogues and IP Prostacyclin Receptor Agonists. Patients with PAH have been shown to have reduced levels of prostacyclin, a naturally occurring substance that relaxes the pulmonary blood vessels, prevents platelet aggregation and inhibits the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the pulmonary vessels. Prostacyclin analogues and IP prostacyclin receptor agonists, such as iloprost, treprostinil and selexipag, marketed by Bayer and Actelion as Ventavis, United Therapeutics as Remodulin and Actelion as Uptravi, respectively, mimic the effects of prostacyclin and are approved therapies for PAH.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These drugs have been shown to improve exercise capacity, quality of life, pulmonary arterial pressure and short-term survival in PAH patients and suggest enhanced long-term survival based on observational studies. However, none of the current treatments is curative and long-term prognosis remains poor. These therapies have a singular approach to treating PAH by modulating the vasoconstrictive or vasodilatory pathways but have limited ability to address other disease processes such as inflammation, cell proliferation, fibrosis and vascular remodeling. Furthermore, these drugs can cause hypotension, which can cause fainting and dizziness and can be life-threatening. As the disease progresses, additional vasodilator therapies are typically added to existing therapies rather than replacing drugs that are no longer providing sufficient benefit.
 Our Solution: PB1046
 PB1046, a novel, subcutaneously-injected VIP analogue, is a recombinant fusion protein composed of VIP and our proprietary ELP half-life extension technology. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of PB1046 observed in our clinical trials, the fusion of VIP to ELP results in both a longer circulating half-life and a prolonged absorption profile, potentially enabling once weekly dosing. We believe that, in addition to vasodilation, PB1046 may suppress the adverse remodeling of blood vessels and increase cardiac contractility and relaxation. PB1046 has been administered to more than 60 patients with hypertension or a history of cardiac disease in three Phase 1/2 clinical trials conducted in the United States with no drug-related SAEs to date.
PB1046 Background
 VIP is a peptide hormone produced in many tissues throughout the body. Native VIP exerts its function in the body by binding to two distinct receptors: vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1, or VPAC1, and vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2, or VPAC2. As is the case for many other peptide hormones, the body uses VIP for distinct purposes in different locations. VPAC1 is found predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract, while VPAC2 is found predominantly in the myocardial wall and pulmonary arteries. VIP plays a key role in the relaxation of smooth muscles, which in turn leads to the dilation of blood vessels and to the lowering of arterial blood pressure. VIP also inhibits airway and pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and has broad anti-inflammatory properties, in addition to neutralizing a variety of pulmonary vasoconstrictors, including endothelin.

We designed PB1046 using our ELP technology to harness the positive therapeutic effects of native VIP while addressing the drawbacks that make native VIP inappropriate for use as a direct therapy. Native VIP is rapidly degraded, and, when injected into the body, is eliminated within minutes, limiting its therapeutic effect. High levels of native VIP also result in severe gastrointestinal problems due to VPAC1 activation. We have used our ELP technology to extend the half-life of VIP in PB1046 to approximately 60 hours. In addition, we designed PB1046 to be active predominantly on VPAC2 rather than VPAC1 in order to preferentially affect the lung and cardiac tissue and reduce the potential for gastrointestinal side effects associated with VPAC1 activation.
 Clinical Development of PB1046
 We have completed two clinical trials of subcutaneously-injected PB1046. In these trials, PB1046 was observed to be well tolerated, with no drug-related SAEs. In both trials, we observed that patients receiving PB1046 experienced reductions in blood pressure that were sustained for at least one week, with no reported episodes of symptomatic hypotension.
PB1046 Phase 2b Clinical Trial
 We are conducting a randomized, double-blinded, controlled Phase 2b trial with an open-label extension in approximately 60 patients with PAH who are functional class II or III. In this trial, patients receive weekly subcutaneous injections of PB1046, in addition to their oral standard of care medications, for 16 weeks. These patients initially receive a dose of 0.2 mg/kg of PB1046, to be escalated and ultimately increased to a maximum dose of 2.0 mg/kg, as tolerated. Because in earlier clinical trials we have observed an association between PB1046 dosing and injection site erythema, in lieu of a completely inactive placebo, we instead use a blinded control that has a very low dose of PB1046 that is below a level likely to have therapeutic benefit but still produces local vasodilation at the injection site in most subjects. The primary endpoint is the change in pulmonary vascular resistance as measured by invasive right heart catheterization. Secondary endpoints include six minute walk distance, respiratory function and biomarkers for cardiac function. Safety endpoints include incidence and severity of AEs and immunogenicity. Six minute walk distance is an important clinical endpoint that the FDA has previously used as the basis for approval of other PAH drugs. We expect to report results from this clinical trial in 2020.
Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose Clinical Trial
 We have completed a single ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial of subcutaneously injected PB1046 in 30 patients with hypertension to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of PB1046 and to demonstrate early proof of concept. In this clinical trial, the patients stopped taking their standard of care anti-hypertensive medications for 14 days before receiving either placebo or a single ascending dose of PB1046 of between 0.05 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg. Consistent with our expectation for slow release of ELP fusion proteins, the half-life of PB1046 was approximately 60 hours and serum levels of PB1046 exhibited a prolonged pharmacokinetic profile extending to at least seven days following a single subcutaneous dose, as illustrated below. This is in contrast to the pharmacokinetics of native VIP in which serum levels of VIP disappear within minutes. We believe these results support once weekly subcutaneous dosing of PB1046.

Pharmacokinetics of single subcutaneous doses of PB1046 in a Phase 1 dose escalation trial
 

The pharmacodynamic activity of PB1046 was assessed by measurements of changes in blood pressure. In the highest dose cohort, we observed that systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving PB1046 were reduced within one day and remained below levels seen in placebo-treated patients for seven days, as illustrated below. At seven days, all patients resumed their standard hypertension medications and subsequent blood pressures, and the magnitude of reduction in blood pressure compared to baseline, were similar whether they had received PB1046 or placebo.

Phase 1b/2a Multiple Ascending Dose Clinical Trial
 We conducted a double-blinded, multiple ascending dose Phase 1b/2a trial in 29 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF, in order to assess the safety and long-acting pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity of subcutaneously injected PB1046 in patients with cardiovascular disease. In HFrEF, the heart muscle is not able to contract adequately and therefore expels less oxygen-rich blood into the body. In this clinical trial, patients remained on their standard of care heart failure medications and received either weekly placebo or weekly multiple ascending doses of PB1046 of between 0.2 mg/kg and 1.2 mg/kg for four weeks. This clinical trial reproduced the safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic observations of the single dose trial, and we observed that once weekly dosing was well tolerated. No drug-related SAEs were reported, and there were no reported instances of hypotension, excluding mild orthostatic hypotension in four subjects, which did not appear to be dose related. Of the 22 subjects who received active study drug, all experienced injection site erythema reaching severe toxicity due to the size of the erythema, and three subjects discontinued treatment due to the erythema. We observed that patients in the highest dose cohort had a statistically significant reduction in blood pressure compared to placebo that was sustained throughout the dosing period, with p-value of 0.043, as illustrated below. A result is considered to be statistically significant when the probability of the result occurring by random chance, rather than from the efficacy of the treatment, is sufficiently low. The conventional method for determining the statistical significance of a result is known as the “p-value,” which represents the probability that random chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value = 0.01 means that there is a 1% probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). Generally, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

Based on the results of this clinical trial, and an assessment of a number of clinical and commercial factors, we determined that our initial indication for PB1046 would be PAH.

Phase 1b/2a CardioMEMS Pilot Clinical Trial
 Prior to launching a large Phase 2b trial in patients with PAH, the FDA requested that we explore the safety and hemodynamics of PB1046 in patients with PAH. To achieve this objective, we initiated a pilot Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in a small population of PAH patients who had an implanted CardioMEMS device. The patients enrolled in this trial were difficult-to-treat patients with long histories of PAH who were no longer responding to their current therapies. These patients initially received a dose of 0.2 mg/kg of PB1046, which was escalated weekly as tolerated and could be increased to a maximum dose of 2.0 mg/kg, while remaining on their existing therapies.
 In the first two patients dosed in this clinical trial, we observed changes in parameters that are important to PAH patients, including that patients’ pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary resistance decreased over time while cardiac stroke volume and overall cardiac output increased. Results for one of the patients in this trial are illustrated below. The results from the second patient were generally consistent with this patient. These observations are consistent with our expectations for a VIP-based therapy. These patients had continued improvements over a period of 60 days, which we believe suggest that, in addition to its vasodilatory activity, PB1046 may also have more long-term effects on blood vessel and cardiac remodeling. These patients also opted into a trial protocol extension.

In subsequent discussions with the FDA, the safety profile of our Phase 1b/2a clinical trial and the available data from this pilot clinical trial were reviewed, and the FDA determined that our data were sufficient to enable initiation of a Phase 2b clinical trial. Accordingly, we do not intend to enroll additional patients in this pilot clinical trial.

Safety Overview from Clinical Trials of PB1046
 There were no drug-related SAEs reported for any of the patients who have received PB1046. When PB1046 was administered subcutaneously, it was almost always associated with a mild- to moderate-injection site erythema, or patch of redness, which on average appeared at about 12 hours after injection. The injection site erythema was not judged by the investigator to be an allergic type reaction; rather, in the investigator’s view, it was likely to be associated with the activity of VIP binding to receptors in the skin, resulting in local vasodilation. Additionally, 70% of patients receiving a subcutaneous injection of PB1046 experienced mild pain or tenderness at the injection site, which occurred hours to days after injection and on average lasted about one week. One-third of the patients also experienced mild pruritus, or itching, at the site of injection. We believe that these events are primarily due to the fused VIP peptide since similar events were not observed in clinical trials of other constructs that contain the ELP domain. None of the injection site reactions were judged to be serious. We have also completed a Phase 1 clinical trial with intravenously administered PB1046 in which we observed a similar tolerability profile. Notably, there were no events of symptomatic hypotension related to PB1046 in any of the subjects who have received PB1046.
Preclinical Studies
 Published independent research indicates that patients with PAH have both reduced levels of VIP in the lung and in circulation as well as increased levels of VPAC2 receptors in lung tissue. Mice bred to be VIP-deficient spontaneously express symptoms of moderately severe PAH. Repeated treatment of these mice with VIP corrected the key characteristics of the disease including right heart dysfunction, vascular remodeling and lung inflammation. In the monocrotaline-induced PAH rat model, an experimental model of PAH, VIP was active in preventing, and partially reversing, the symptoms of PAH. Combination therapy with VIP and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan was shown to be more active than either drug alone. Furthermore, in multiple preclinical studies we have demonstrated the benefits of PB1046 in cardiomyopathies, due to its ability to induce heart contractility and relaxation effects without an increase in myocardial oxygen demand.
Potential Applications of PB1046 in Other Indications
 The biological activities associated with VIP have the potential to provide therapeutic benefit to patients with other diseases. We believe that PB1046 provides a mechanism to bring these VIP-based therapies forward in the following indications:

• | DMD-associated Cardiomyopathy. Cardiac dysfunction is a very common manifestation of DMD and a common cause of death for individuals with this condition. The ability of PB1046 to increase contractibility of cardiac muscles presents the possibility that it could provide therapeutic benefit to these patients. We observed that PB1046 slowed deterioration in cardiac function and preserved skeletal muscle function in a mouse model of DMD. In addition to direct effects on cardiac function, we believe decreased fibrosis also contributed to the positive effects of PB1046 on both cardiac and skeletal muscle in this model.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cystic Fibrosis. VIP has been shown to stimulate the processing of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, or CFTR, the protein defective in patients with cystic fibrosis, or CF. In mice lacking the gene for VIP, CFTR is not located at the cell surface, where it is required to function properly, but accumulates within the cell. These mice have lung abnormalities that resemble CF and treatment with VIP peptide restored CFTR to the cell surface and corrected the lung tissue abnormalities. Treatment of human epithelial cells containing the most common CFTR mutation found in patients with CF, F508del, with PB1046 has been observed to increase CFTR activity, providing further support that PB1046 may have potential as a treatment for patients with CF.

ELP Technology
 Our proprietary ELP technology is based on recombinant biopolymers called ELPs, which comprise individual subunits or building blocks derived from a five-amino acid repeat motif found in the human protein elastin. This five-amino acid motif is repeated multiple times to form the ELP biopolymer. We produce our ELP-based products by engineering E. coli to produce a single protein comprising the active peptide or protein fused to the ELP biopolymer. This molecule is active as a fusion protein and does not require cleavage or release of the peptide. ELP fusion proteins are produced in the soluble fraction of E. coli, which allows for ease of scale-up and purification.
 Fusion to ELPs significantly improves the stability of peptides and proteins and enables use of natural or minimally altered peptide sequences. We believe these fusion proteins retain similar potency to the native molecule while being protected from degradation by enzymes in circulation. Additionally, we have observed that the fusion protein maintains the solubility and long half-life of the ELP, in many cases allowing for long-term liquid stability, which is important for injectable products.
 ELP fusion proteins can undergo a reversible phase transition, in which ELP fusion proteins aggregate and form a sustained-release depot under the skin. This phase transition is driven by changes in temperature. At lower temperatures ELP fusion proteins are completely soluble, while at warmer temperatures the ELP fusion proteins are in a gel-like state. This allows the ELP fusion proteins to be easily handled and administered subcutaneously using standard, fine gauge needles and syringes. Once the ELP fusion protein is exposed to body heat, it forms a drug depot that slowly releases soluble ELP fusion protein into circulation. By modifying the amino acid sequence of the individual subunits and by varying its overall length, we can engineer our ELP fusion proteins to be released on timescales extending to a week or longer.
 Product candidates based on our ELP technology, including prior product candidates that we ceased development of in order to focus on the development of therapies for orphan diseases, have been evaluated in over 500 patients with no known drug-related SAEs.
 Preclinical Programs
 We continue to invest in applying our ELP technology to the development of novel product candidates. Our focus is on peptides and proteins that are scientifically or clinically validated but where a suboptimal half-life, stability and delivery limit their potential therapeutic applications.
 Our more advanced preclinical programs include:
  
• | Glucagon-like peptide-2. Glucagon-like peptide-2, or GLP-2, stimulates growth of intestinal villi, increasing their ability to absorb nutrients. GLP-2 is a potential treatment for patients with short bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease or mucositis in patients undergoing cancer treatment. Teduglutide, currently marketed under the brand name Gattex, is an FDA-approved therapy based on GLP-2 that requires daily injections. In animal models, our GLP-2-ELP product candidate provided sustained levels of GLP-2, resulting in greater efficacy than teduglutide with less frequent dosing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | C-type natriuretic peptide. C-type natriuretic peptide, or CNP, is a regulator of bone growth and can rescue defects in fibroblast growth factor 3 that cause achondroplasia resulting in dwarfism. Native CNP has a half-life of less than three minutes, limiting its use as a direct therapeutic. We are developing our CNP-ELP product candidate to deliver therapeutic levels of CNP with once weekly subcutaneous injections. In a mouse model, we observed a demonstrated effect on linear growth when our CNP-ELP product candidate was injected once every four days.

 Duke University
 In October 2006, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, which was most recently amended in May 2017, with Duke University, or the Duke License. Pursuant to the Duke License, Duke granted to us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights and a non-exclusive license to know-how owned or controlled by Duke to develop and commercialize any products or processes covered under the Duke License, or the Duke licensed products. The in-licensed patent rights are generally directed to providing extended exposure for proteins and peptides administered through subcutaneous injections and include 13 registered patents in the United States, seven registered patents in foreign jurisdictions, three pending patent applications in the United States and seven pending foreign applications. The last patent is expected to expire in 2030 without extension.
 We have the right to sublicense the Duke licensed products to third parties subject to certain conditions specified in the Duke License. In May 2017, certain patent rights under the Duke License reverted to Duke, and Duke subsequently granted to us a non-exclusive license under such patent rights to develop and commercialize any products or processes involving such patent rights. We also granted back to Duke an exclusive sublicense under certain patent rights licensed to us under the Duke License and a non-exclusive license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by us, in each case to exploit compounds developed using our proprietary ELP technology.
 Under the terms of the Duke License, we have paid or are required to pay:

 Manufacturing
 Our clinical and preclinical product candidates are currently manufactured using a microbial expression system. Our manufacturing utilizes a straight-forward E. coli fermentation process with a simple column chromatography-based purification process. We believe that these manufacturing processes will enable our product candidates to be manufactured efficiently for clinical and commercial applications. We do not have any cGMP manufacturing facilities. Instead, we utilize third parties for the cGMP manufacture of our product candidates for clinical trials, and we intend to continue to use third parties in the near term for the future clinical development and, if they are approved, commercial manufacture of our drug products. Our contract manufacturers are FDA-inspected establishments that have a history of supplying products to the pharmaceutical industry in accordance with cGMP.
 PB2452
 PB2452 bulk drug substance, provided to us pursuant to the MedImmune License, was filled and released for use in our Phase 1 clinical trial. The PB2452 drug substance was manufactured by Wacker Biotech GmbH, or Wacker, a third-party contract manufacturer, utilizing Wacker’s proprietary E. coli strain. Manufacturing has continued at Wacker to generate drug supply for our planned Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials. We have engaged BioVectra, Inc. to serve as our contract manufacturer of PB2452 for later-stage clinical trials and, if approved, commercial-scale production. As we advance PB2452 through clinical development, we may establish additional supply agreements for the manufacture of PB2452 in order to meet our expected needs for potential commercial demand.
 PB1046 and our ELP Preclinical Pipeline
 To date, we have relied on a non-proprietary E. coli strain for the production of PB1046 and our preclinical ELP pipeline candidates. Third-party manufacturers have performed the cGMP manufacturing of the drug product. Due to efficiencies achieved to date, we intend to utilize this non-proprietary strain for future manufacturing. As we advance PB1046 and other preclinical product candidates through development, we intend to establish additional supply agreements and/or technology transfer agreements in order to meet our expected needs for future clinical trials and potential commercial demand.
 20


Sales and Marketing
 We retain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates. Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We intend to commercialize PB2452, if approved, independently in the United States because we believe the patient populations and medical specialists for these indications are sufficiently concentrated to allow us to effectively promote these products with a targeted sales team. We may explore, and selectively pursue, strategic collaborations or partnerships with third parties to commercialize PB1046, if approved, in the United States and any approved products outside of the United States in order to maximize the commercial potential of our products.
Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future.
 Our current and potential future competitors have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for the disorders we are targeting by a competitor could render our current or future drug candidates non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our drug candidates before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses.
 PB2452
 There are currently no known reversal agents approved or in clinical development for ticagrelor. As a result, market acceptance of PB2452, if approved, will depend heavily on the continued market acceptance and use of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor competes against other commercially available antiplatelet therapies, including other P2Y12 receptor antagonists, many of which are available as generic drugs and are therefore currently significantly less expensive than ticagrelor. New antiplatelet therapies may also be developed in the future, including other reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonists and other antiplatelet therapies, which could also have reversal agents, that could displace ticagrelor as the preferred antiplatelet agent for ACS. 
 PB1046
 Although we anticipate that PB1046 may be used as a complement to patients’ existing therapies, we expect to compete with existing treatments for PAH patients with class II through class IV symptoms that target the endothelin, nitric oxide and prostacyclin pathways, as well as any generic equivalents that may be developed. In addition to currently approved drugs within these classes, we are also aware of a number of PAH therapies in clinical development, including:
  
• | Ralinepag, an oral IP prostacyclin receptor agonist being developed by Arena Pharmaceuticals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trevyent, a formulation of treprostinil being developed by United Therapeutics;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bardoxolone methyl, an oral therapy being developed by Reata Pharmaceuticals for connective tissue disease-associated PAH;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | LIQ861, a powder formulation of treprostinil designed for deep-lung delivery using a disposable, dry powder inhaler being developed by Liquidia Technologies;

• | Beraprost sodium 314d modified release, a single isomer oral prostacyclin analogue being developed by Lung Biotechnology PBC;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sotatercept, being developed by Acceleron;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | GB002, being developed by Gossamer Bio;
--+----------------------------------------


• | INS1009, an inhaled nanoparticle formulation of a treprostinil prodrug being developed by Insmed Incorporated; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | INOpulse, inhaled nitric oxide being developed by Bellerophon Therapeutics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for PB2452, PB1046 and future product candidates and related discoveries and our ELP technology; to operate without infringing on or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing or otherwise violating our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our ELP technology, our product candidates and other proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 The term of individual patents varies depending on the date of filing of the patent application and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional application. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of the delay by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in issuing the patent. In addition, a patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the patent term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period of the drug covered by the patent. The patent term extension based upon delay by the FDA can be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and the extension may only apply to one patent that covers the approved drug (and to only those patent claims covering the approved drug or a method for using it). There can be no assurance that any such patent term adjustment or extension will be obtained. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically in countries that we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

As of December 31, 2018, our patent estate contained at least 15 patent families that we own or in-license which protects various aspects of our ELP technology or our product candidates. We own or have rights in 20 United States patents, over 10 United States patent applications, over 50 foreign patents and over 40 foreign patent applications.
 PB2452
 With regard to PB2452, we in-licensed one patent family. As of December 31, 2018, this patent family includes one issued U.S. patent with composition of matter claims covering PB2452 that is scheduled to expire in 2036 without taking patent term extensions into account, five pending U.S. patent applications and 13 pending foreign applications, that if issued, would expire in 2035. We are heavily dependent on the patented or proprietary technologies that we license from third parties.
 PB1046
 As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio of owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications relating to PB1046 consists of six issued patents in the United States, five pending applications in the United States, 16 granted foreign patents and 19 pending foreign applications with claims directed to compositions of matter covering PB1046 and methods of use thereof, including use in PAH, cystic fibrosis and cardiomyopathy associated with DMD, that we expect to expire between 2027 and 2036, without taking patent term extensions into account
 ELP Technology
 As of December 31, 2018, we owned two patent families relating to our ELP technology, which consists of one granted patent in the United States, one pending application in the United States and six pending foreign applications. The granted patent expires in 2021 without taking patent term extensions into account.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.
 The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 23


 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Development
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some trials also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
  
• | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 24


 
• | Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product or, for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 BLA Submission and Review
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
 Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 25


If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use and could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-marketing studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Accelerated Approval Program
 Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval may be eligible for FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. For biologic products, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee.
 26


A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives: intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and rolling review. Breakthrough therapy designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 27


The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities and proposed sales, marketing and education programs and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security and transparency laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those laws described below.
 28


The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
 In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act and the civil monetary penalties statute.
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization on certain health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates, independent contractors that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 We may also be subject to state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws; state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; as well as state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 29


Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participating in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Market acceptance and sales of any drug products depend in part on coverage and the extent to which adequate reimbursement for drug products will be available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and other private health insurers. Coverage and reimbursement for our product also depends on coverage and adequate reimbursement for the procedures using PB2452 as a ticagrelor reversal agent and PB1046 for the treatment of PAH. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. Separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which our product is used may not be available. Even if the procedure using our product is covered, third-party payors may package the cost of the drug into the procedure payment and not separately reimburse the physician for the costs associated with our product. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover or separately reimburse for our products could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved. Additionally, in the United States, there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among third-party payors. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided is made on a payor-by-payor basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement.
 Third-party payors determine which medical procedures they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Even if a third-party payor covers a particular procedure, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate. Patients who are treated in-office for a medical condition generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the procedure and may be unwilling to undergo such procedures in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement.
 Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that a procedure is safe, effective and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed medical journals; included in clinical practice guidelines; and neither cosmetic, experimental, nor investigational.
 Further, from time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment rates are updated and revised by third-party payors. Such updates could impact the demand for our product candidates, to the extent that customers who are prescribed our product candidates, if approved, are not separately reimbursed for the cost of the product candidates. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program updates to physician payments, which is done on an annual basis. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, ended the use of the statutory formula and provided for a 0.5% annual increase in payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2019, but no annual update from 2020 through 2025. MACRA also introduced a merit based incentive bonus program for Medicare physicians beginning in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the merit based incentive program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program.

Impact of Healthcare Reform on our Business
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of drug product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect the profitable sale of drug product candidates.
 Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things: (1) established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs; (2) expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B drug pricing program; (3) increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP; (4) expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability; (5) addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; (6) introduced a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; (7) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and (8) established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug.
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business.
 31


Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
 Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint,” or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. Although a number of these and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Moreover, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program.

PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC.
 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  
1. | Organization and Description of Business
---+-----------------------------------------

Description of Business 
 PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on January 10, 2002. The Company is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapies to treat orphan diseases, with an initial focus on cardiopulmonary indications. The Company’s lead product candidate, PB2452, is a novel reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor, which the Company is developing for the treatment of patients on ticagrelor who are experiencing a major bleeding event or those who require urgent surgery. The Company recently completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of PB2452 in healthy subjects and intends to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial in healthy older subjects in the first half of 2019. The Company’s second product candidate, PB1046, is a once-weekly fusion protein currently in a Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. PB1046 utilizes the Company’s proprietary half-life extending elastin-like polypeptide (“ELP”), technology, which also serves as the engine for future product pipeline candidates.
 Initial Public Offering
 On October 22, 2018, the Company completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of its common stock, which resulted in the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 9,864,666 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, generating net proceeds of approximately $43.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs. In connection with the completion of the IPO, all then-outstanding shares of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted into an aggregate of 13,200,115 shares of common stock. 
 Upon completion of the IPO, the Company’s certificate of incorporation was amended and restated. Under the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the Company’s authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share.
 Reverse Stock Split
 In October 2018, the Company effected a 11.0634-for-1 reverse split of its outstanding common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the stock split, and the par value and other terms of the common stock were not affected by the stock split. All share and per share amounts, including stock options, have been retroactively adjusted in these financial statements for all periods presented to reflect the reverse stock split. Further, exercise prices of stock options have been retroactively adjusted in these financial statements for all periods presented to reflect the reverse stock split.
Liquidity
 The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and, as of December 31, 2018, had an accumulated deficit of $122.9 million. The Company expects to continue to incur net losses for at least the next several years. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $61.0 million and working capital of $58.1 million. The Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital requirements into the second quarter of 2020.

2. | Significant Accounting Policies
---+--------------------------------

Use of Estimates
 The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Company’s financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates in the Company’s financial statements relate to the valuation of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants prior to the IPO, the conversion option on the convertible notes and clinical trial accruals. Although these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains certain deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company could experience losses on the money market funds in the future.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash in readily available checking and money market accounts.
 Restricted Cash
 The Company had restricted cash of $20,000 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, which was held in a certificate of deposit at the Company’s bank to secure the Company’s corporate credit card.
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates of their fair value because of the short maturity of these items. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, the Company believes the fair value of the term loan approximates its carrying value (see Note 6).
 Property and Equipment
 Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets (three to five years) using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term.
 F-8



Long-Lived Assets
 The Company regularly reviews the carrying value and estimated lives of all of its long-lived assets, including property and equipment to determine whether indicators of impairment may exist which warrant adjustments to carrying values or estimated useful lives. The determinants used for this evaluation include management’s estimate of the asset’s ability to generate net positive cash flow in future periods as well as the strategic significance of the assets to the Company’s business objective. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the extent that the estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. The Company has not recognized any impairment losses in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 Preferred Stock Warrant Liability
 The Company previously issued freestanding warrants to purchase shares of its redeemable convertible preferred stock. Since the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock was classified outside of permanent equity, those warrants were classified as liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. Warrants classified as liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of issuance and were revalued at each subsequent balance sheet date, with fair value changes recognized as increases or reductions to other income (expense) in the accompanying statements of operations. The Company estimated the fair value of these warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
 In connection with the Company’s IPO in October 2018, all warrants were either exercised or converted into warrants to purchase common stock, at which time the liability was reclassified to stockholders’ equity.
 Preclinical and Clinical Trial Accruals
 The Company accrues and expenses preclinical studies and clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the proportion of work completed over the life of the individual trial and subject enrollment rates in accordance with agreements with clinical research organizations and clinical trial sites. The Company determines the estimates by reviewing contracts, vendor agreements and purchase orders, and through discussions with internal clinical personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. However, actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain, subject to risks and may change depending upon a number of factors, including the Company’s clinical development plan.
 Management makes estimates of the Company’s accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the Company’s financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to the Company at that time. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, the Company will adjust the accrual accordingly. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services, including fees for process development or manufacturing and distribution of clinical supplies that will be used in future research and development activities, are deferred and recognized as expense in the period that the related goods are consumed or services are performed.
 Research and Development Expense
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
 Stock-Based Compensation
 The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation based on the estimated fair value at the date of grant. Currently, the Company’s stock-based awards consist only of stock options; however, future grants under the Company’s equity compensation plan may also consist of shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and performance units. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of estimates. 
 The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost for ratably vesting stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.
 F-9



The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, the fair value of the underlying common stock prior to the IPO, the expected dividend yield of the Company’s common stock, the expected volatility of the price of the Company’s common stock, and the expected term of the option. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, the Company’s stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. 
 Income Taxes
 The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
 The Company recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If management determines that the Company would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, management would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
 The Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) management determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, management recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within income tax expense, and any accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line.
 Grant Revenues
 Grant revenues are derived from government grants that support the Company’s efforts on specific research projects. The Company has determined that the government agencies providing grants to the Company are not customers. The Company recognizes grant revenue when there is reasonable assurance of compliance with the conditions of the grant and reasonable assurance that the grant revenue will be received.
Net Loss Per Share
 Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding for the period. Common stock equivalents are only included when their effect is dilutive. The Company’s potentially dilutive securities which include redeemable convertible preferred stock, warrants and outstanding stock options under the Company’s stock option plan have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as they would be anti-dilutive. For all periods presented, there is no difference in the number of shares used to compute basic and diluted shares outstanding due to the Company’s net loss position.
 F-10



The following table sets forth the outstanding potentially dilutive securities that have been excluded in the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. This update amends the current accounting guidance for lease transactions. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize both assets and liabilities for any leases in excess of twelve months. Additionally, certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures will also be required in the financial statements. This guidance will be effective for public companies for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 in 2019. Upon adoption, the Company expects to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability of an amount between $1.5 million and $2.5 million.
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230). ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice for certain cash receipts and cash payments. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2018, and the adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s financial statements.
 In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, which clarifies when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2018, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
 In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which largely aligns the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees with the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees. Under previous GAAP, the accounting for nonemployee share-based payments differed from that applied to employee awards, particularly with regard to the measurement date and the impact of performance conditions. Under the new guidance, (1) equity-classified share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees will be measured at the grant date, instead of the previous requirement to remeasure the awards through the performance completion date, (2) for performance conditions, compensation cost associated with the award will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is probable, rather than upon achievement of the performance condition and (3) the current requirement to reassess the classification (equity or liability) for nonemployee awards upon vesting will be eliminated, except for awards in the form of convertible instruments. The Company adopted this standard effective October 1, 2018, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement - Disclosure Framework (Topic 820): Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The updated guidance improves the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for any removed or modified disclosures. The Company is currently assessing the timing and impact of adopting the updated provisions.

3. | Fair Value Measurement
---+-----------------------

 Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
 The Company classifies fair value measurements in one of the following three categories for disclosure purposes:
  
Level 1: | Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 2: | Inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 3: | Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.
---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Company’s cash equivalents are classified using Level 1 inputs within the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. None of the Company’s non-financial assets or liabilities are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. No transfers between levels have occurred during the periods presented.
 The Company estimated the fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants at the time of issuance and subsequent remeasurement using the Black-Scholes option pricing model at each reporting date, based on the following inputs: the risk-free interest rate; the expected dividend rate; the remaining contractual life of the warrants; the fair value of the underlying stock; and the expected volatility of the price of the underlying common stock. The estimates were based, in part, on subjective assumptions.
 The following table summarizes the Company’s assets and liabilities that require fair value measurements on a recurring basis and their respective input levels based on the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):

6. | Debt
---+-----

Convertible Promissory Notes
 In January 2017 and October 2017, the Company issued $14.7 million of convertible promissory notes (the “2017 Notes”) to holders of Series C-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock (“Series C-1”). The 2017 Notes bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum. Upon a subsequent equity financing of at least $10.0 million prior to the stated maturity date, the 2017 Notes plus accrued interest would automatically convert into shares of the stock issued by the Company in such financing at a price equal to 80% of the lowest issue price. 
 The 2017 Notes could have converted into a variable number of shares of preferred stock, and accordingly, the Company determined the conversion provision to be a redemption feature. The redemption feature was evaluated as an embedded derivative and bifurcated from the convertible promissory notes due to the substantial premium paid upon redemption and accounted for as a derivative instrument. Upon bifurcating the redemption feature, the Company recorded a debt discount of $3.0 million that was recognized in interest expense over the term of the 2017 Notes.
 In connection with the 2017 Notes, the Company issued warrants to the noteholders to purchase 304,397 shares of Series C-1. The warrants were exercisable for $0.12 per share and would expire upon the earlier of (1) the date of the initial closing of a liquidation event, as defined, (2) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering or (3) January 2024. All warrants were exercised in connection with the closing of the Company’s IPO. The Company recorded a debt discount of $1.7 million, which represents the estimated fair value of the warrants, upon issuance of the 2017 Notes, which was being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2017 Notes using the effective-interest method.
 F-14



In August 2018, the Company sold 1,842,959 shares of Series D redeemable preferred stock (“Series D”) to new and existing investors at a price of $9.659 per share for net proceeds of $17.7 million and issued warrants to purchase 368,582 shares of Series C-1 at an exercise price of $0.12 per share (the “Series D Financing”). Concurrent with the Series D Financing, all of the Company’s previously outstanding 2017 Notes, including accrued interest thereon, were converted into 2,080,209 shares of Series D. 
 Interest expense, including the debt discount related to the 2017 Notes, was $3.4 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 Term Loan
 In October 2017, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (“SVB Loan”) with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”), pursuant to which the Company could borrow up to $7.5 million, issuable in three separate tranches (“Growth Capital Advances”) of $3.5 million (“Tranche A”), $2.0 million (“Tranche B”) and $2.0 million (“Tranche C”). Each of the Growth Capital Advances would become available upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. Under the original terms of the SVB Loan, the Company was to make interest-only payments through June 30, 2018 at a rate equal to the Prime Rate as defined per the SVB Loan. The interest-only period would be extended to December 31, 2018 if the Company borrowed the remaining tranches, followed by an amortization period of 24 months of equal monthly payments of principal plus interest amounts until paid in full. In connection with the SVB Loan, the Company issued to SVB a warrant to purchase 49,713 shares of Series C-1 at an exercise price of $9.659 per share. The warrant is immediately exercisable and expires on October 18, 2027. The Company was required to make a final payment equal to 7% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Growth Capital Advances at maturity. In November 2017, the Company drew $3.5 million from Tranche A.
 The Company had the option to prepay all, but not less than all, of the borrowed amounts, provided that the Company would have been obligated to pay a prepayment fee equal to (a) 3.0% of the outstanding principal balance of the applicable Growth Capital Advances if prepayment was made prior to the first anniversary of the effective date of the SVB Loan, (b) 2.0% of the outstanding principal balance of the applicable Growth Capital Advances if prepayment was made by the second anniversary of the effective date of the SVB Loan or (c) 1.0% of the outstanding principal balance of the applicable Growth Capital Advances if prepayment was made after the second anniversary of the effective date of the SVB Loan.
 In April 2018, the SVB Loan was amended to extend the draw period of Tranche B and Tranche C to April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2018, respectively, as well as to extend the interest-only period through July 31, 2018, which would be extended to December 31, 2018 if the Company borrowed Tranche B and Tranche C. Additionally, all Capital Growth Advances would mature on June 1, 2020; however, if the Company were to draw Tranche B and Tranche C, the maturity date would be December 31, 2020. On April 30, 2018, the Company borrowed $2.0 million under Tranche B.
 In July 2018, the SVB Loan was amended to further extend the draw period of Tranche C to August 31, 2018, as well as to extend the interest-only period of the SVB Loan through August 31, 2018, which would be extended to December 31, 2018 if the Company were to draw Tranche C. In August 2018, the Company borrowed $2.0 million under Tranche C.
 The Company’s obligations under the SVB Loan are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of its current and future assets, other than its owned intellectual property. The Company is also obligated to comply with various other customary covenants, including restrictions on its ability to encumber intellectual property assets.
 F-15



The Company recorded a debt discount of $0.4 million for the estimated fair value of warrants and debt issuance costs upon the borrowing of Tranche A and Tranche B, which is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the SVB Loan using the effective-interest method. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had $7.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of outstanding principal under the SVB Loan and $7.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, is reflected on the balance sheet net of debt discounts. Interest expense, including amortization of debt discount related to the term debt, totaled $0.6 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the SVB Loan as of December 31, 2018.
 On March 25, 2019, the Company repaid the outstanding principal balance and accrued portion of the final payment for the SVB Loan in full (see Note 15). The following table sets forth by year the Company’s required future principal payments for the refinanced SVB Loan (in thousands):

---+------------------------------

Operating Leases
 The Company leases office and research and development facilities and equipment under various non-cancellable operating lease agreements. In January 2010, the Company entered into a lease for office and laboratory space in Malvern, Pennsylvania (the “Malvern Lease”). The Malvern Lease commenced in March 2010 and was amended to extend its term to September 30, 2023. This lease contains escalating rent payments. In December 2018, the Company entered into a lease for office space in San Diego, California, which expires in October 2022.
 The Company’s future minimum commitments under its non-cancelable operating leases were as follows (in thousands):
 
 
Year Ending December 31, | | 
-------------------------+---+------
2019 | $ | 342 
2020 | | 368 
2021 | | 373 
2022 | | 360 
2023 | | 204 
Thereafter | | — 
Total | $ | 1,647

 
The Company recognizes rent expense for the facility operating leases on a straight-line basis. The Company accounts for the difference between the minimum lease payments and the straight-line amount as deferred rent. Rent expense was $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 Legal Proceedings
 The Company is not currently a party to any litigation, nor is management aware of any pending or threatened litigation against the Company, that it believes would materially affect the Company’s business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.
 F-16



Supply Agreement
 The Company has entered into a Master Services Agreement (“Supply Agreement”) with BioVectra Inc., (“BioVectra”).  BioVectra will manufacture and supply cGMP-grade quantities of the Company’s PB2452 proprietary drug product (“Product”) for the Company’s potential PB2452 Phase 3 clinical trial as well as any work required to support the marketing authorization filing.  A Commercial Supply Agreement is being put in place for the Product, if it is approved by the FDA.  
 BioVectra is responsible for the facility, including performing all work related to the procurement, design, project management, installation, assembly, commissioning and validation of the facility and all equipment, and for financing all costs associated with building out the facility. The Company will be responsible for the purchase of certain equipment and raw materials for the production process. 
  
8. | Preferred Stock Warrants
---+-------------------------

 The Company accounted for its warrants to purchase shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock as liabilities as they were exercisable for a redeemable instrument. The Company continued to adjust the liability for changes in fair value of these warrants until they were exercised or converted to common stock warrants.
 The following table summarizes the outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants and the corresponding exercise price as of December 31, 2017:
 
 
 | Number of Shares Outstanding as of | | | | | 
-------------------------------------+------------------------------------+---------+----------------+---+-------+----------------
 | December 31, 2017 | | Exercise Price | | | Expiration Date
Series AA warrants | | 1,506 | | $ | 13.28 | | March 7, 2018 
2009 Series B warrants | | 25,884 | | $ | 9.659 | | December 22, 2019

Term loan Series C-1 warrants | | 49,713 | | $ | 9.659 | | October 18, 2027 
 | | 486,356 | | | | | 

 
In August 2018, as part of the Series D Financing, the Company issued warrants to purchase 368,582 shares of Series C-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock (the “2018 Series C-1 warrants”) at an exercise price of $0.12 per share. 
 In connection with the IPO in October 2018, all outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants were either exercised or converted to common stock warrants. During 2018, stockholders exercised the outstanding 2014 Series B warrants, convertible debt Series C-1 warrants and the 2018 Series C-1 warrants to purchase an aggregate of 764,034 shares of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock, at a weighted-average exercise price of $0.12 per share. The outstanding 2009 Series B warrants and Term loan Series C-1 warrants were automatically converted into an aggregate of 75,597 common stock warrants, to which the liability was reclassified to stockholders’ equity.

Stock Plans
 In July 2018, the Company amended the Company’s Amended and Restated 2002 Stock Plan (the “2002 Plan”) to reserve an additional 800,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2002 Plan. 
 In October 2018, the Company’s board of directors and stockholders adopted and approved the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”), which is a successor to and continuation of the 2002 Plan. The 2018 Plan became effective upon the execution of the underwriting agreement related to the IPO on October 17, 2018. No further grants will be made under the 2002 Plan. 
 Initially, the maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be issued under the 2018 Plan is 3,231,626 shares. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 1,670,921 shares available for grant under the 2018 Plan. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on January 1, 2019 through January 1, 2028, in an amount equal to 3% of the total number of shares of the Company’s capital stock outstanding on the last day of the calendar month before the date of each automatic increase, or a lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors. Subject to this provision, the Company added 734,948 shares available for grant to the 2018 Plan effective January 1, 2019. The maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be issued on the exercise of incentive stock options under the 2018 Plan is 9,694,878.

The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of options granted was $2.75 and $1.00 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was $0.2 million and $686 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 As of December 31, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested employee and non-employee stock option awards was $1.6 million, which was expected to be recognized in expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.9 years.
 In October 2018, the Company’s board of directors and stockholders approved the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). The ESPP became effective on October 17, 2018. The purpose of the ESPP is to secure the services of new employees, to retain the services of existing employees and to provide incentives for such individuals to exert maximum efforts toward the Company’s success and that of the Company’s affiliates. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code for U.S. employees.
 The ESPP authorizes the issuance of 196,000 shares of the Company’s common stock under purchase rights granted to the Company’s employees or to employees of any of the Company’s designated affiliates. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, beginning on January 1, 2019 through January 1, 2028, by the lesser of (1) 1% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on the last day of the calendar month before the date of the automatic increase, and (2) 490,000 shares; provided that before the date of any such increase, the Company’s board of directors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (1) and (2). Subject to this provision, the Company added 244,983 shares available for grant to the ESPP effective January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, no shares of common stock have been purchased under the ESPP.
 Determining Fair Value of Stock Options
 The fair value of each grant of stock options was determined by the Company using the methods and assumptions discussed below. Certain of these inputs are subjective and generally require judgment to determine.
 Expected Term—The expected term of stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to be outstanding. The Company uses the simplified method for estimating the expected term. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options.
 F-19



Expected Volatility—Due to the Company’s limited operating history and lack of company-specific historical or implied volatility, the expected volatility assumption was determined by examining the historical volatilities of a group of industry peers whose share prices are publicly available.
 Risk-Free Interest Rate—The risk-free rate assumption is based on the U.S. Treasury instruments, the terms of which were consistent with the expected term of the Company’s stock options.
 Expected Dividend—The Company has not paid and does not intend to pay dividends.
 Common Stock Valuation—Due to the absence of a public market trading the Company’s common stock prior to the IPO, it was necessary to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying the stock-based grants when performing fair value calculations using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the common stock underlying the stock-based grants was assessed for each grant date by the board of directors. All options to purchase shares of common stock have been granted with an exercise price per share no less than the fair value per share of the common stock underlying those options on the date of grant.
 In the absence of a public trading market for the Company’s common stock, the Company determined the estimated fair value of its common stock using methodologies, approaches, and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) Audit and Accounting Practice Aid Series: Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (“AICPA Practice Aid”).
 The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the weighted average assumptions in the table below:

11. | License Agreements
----+-------------------

 MedImmune Limited
 In November 2017, the Company entered into a license agreement (“MedImmune License”) with MedImmune Limited (“MedImmune”). MedImmune is a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc. Pursuant to the terms of the MedImmune License, MedImmune granted the Company exclusive global rights for the purpose of developing and commercializing products under the MedImmune License (“MedImmune licensed product”). In consideration of the license and other rights granted by MedImmune, the Company made an upfront payment of $0.1 million, which was included as research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company is also obligated to make a series of contingent milestone payments totaling up to an aggregate of $18.0 million upon the achievement of clinical development and regulatory milestones. As of December 31, 2018, none of the clinical development or regulatory filing milestones had been met. In addition, the Company will pay MedImmune tiered 
 F-20



royalties ranging from mid-single-digit to low-teen percentages of net sales of any MedImmune licensed products and additional payments of up to $50.0 million in aggregate commercial milestones. The Company also must pay quarterly fees relating to technical services provided by MedImmune. The MedImmune License requires the Company to cooperate with MedImmune on commercial messaging of PB2452 and provides MedImmune with the return of rights to PB2452 if certain commercial diligence requirements are not achieved by the Company. In addition, the MedImmune License offers an option for third-party product storage costs. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had incurred and reimbursed MedImmune $0.5 million for such third-party product storage costs. The Company incurred an insignificant amount of third-party product storage costs in the year ended December 31, 2018. AstraZeneca plc is a stockholder of the Company.
 Duke University
 In October 2006, the Company entered into a license agreement with Duke University (“Duke”) (as amended, the “Duke License”). Pursuant to the Duke License, Duke granted to the Company an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights and a non-exclusive license to know-how owned or controlled by Duke to develop and commercialize any products or processes covered under the Duke License (the “Duke licensed products”). The Duke License was amended in February 2016 to allow Duke to use the Company’s technology in the area of small-molecule oncologics. The Duke License is a worldwide, sublicensable agreement and remains in full effect for the life of the last-to-expire patents included in the patent rights, which is approximately 20 years. The Company is required to apply for, prosecute and maintain all U.S. and foreign patent rights under the Duke License.
 The Company is obligated to pay up to $2.2 million upon the achievement of clinical development and regulatory milestones and up to $0.4 million upon the achievement of commercial milestones. The Duke License may be terminated by Duke if the Company fails to meet certain clinical development and regulatory milestones within specified timeframes. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its development obligations.
 The Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop one or more products or processes and introduce them into commercial markets. Duke will receive low single-digit royalty percentages on net sales by the Company or its sublicensee, with minimum aggregate royalties of $0.2 million payable following the Company’s achievement of certain commercial milestones. No sales of Duke licensed products or services have occurred since the effective date through December 31, 2018.
 Certain alliance fee payments up to the greater of $0.3 million or a low double-digit percentage of the fees the Company receives from a third party in consideration of forming a strategic alliance, may be required depending upon how the patent rights are commercialized. The Company will pay Duke the first $1.0 million of nonroyalty payments it receives from a sublicensee, and thereafter a specified percentage of any additional nonroyalty payments it receives. If Duke receives revenue as a result of a license or sublicense to a third party in the field of small-molecule oncologics, it will pay the Company a specified percentage of the amount of such revenue in excess of $1.0 million. Duke is also a stockholder of the Company.
  
12. | Grant Revenue
----+--------------

 In February 2018, the Company received Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) grants from the National Institutes of Health in an aggregate amount of $2.8 million to support the clinical development of PB1046 for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension for the period from February 17, 2018 to July 31, 2020. In connection with the SBIR grants, the U.S. government will receive a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use any technology the Company develops under such grants. The Company recognized $0.7 million under the SBIR grants in the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company did not recognize any grant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.

13. | Income Taxes
----+-------------

 The Company’s loss before income taxes was $23.8 million and $10.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively and was generated entirely in the United States. The Company did not record current or deferred income tax expense or benefit during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 A reconciliation of income tax expense (benefit) to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to the loss from operations is summarized for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as follows (in thousands):

Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are shown below:
 
 
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+--------
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | 
Net deferred tax asset: | | | | | | | 
Net operating loss carryforwards | $ | 31,744 | | | $ | 26,138 | 
Research and development credits | | 4,615 | | | | 3,863 | 
Accrued expenses | | 332 | | | | 239 | 
Intangibles | | 69 | | | | 110 |

Total net deferred tax asset | | 36,796 | | | | 30,370 | 
Valuation allowance for deferred tax asset | | (36,796 | ) | | | (30,370 | )
Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance | $ | — | | | $ | — | 

 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, management assessed the realizability of deferred tax assets and evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. This evaluation utilizes the framework contained in ASC 740, Income Taxes, whereby management considers all available positive and negative evidence as of the balance sheet date to determine whether all or some portion of the Company’s deferred tax assets will be realized. Under this guidance, a valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%) that the asset will not be realized.
 F-22



Management followed the guidance in ASC 740, which states that “a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome” and concluded that the Company’s deferred tax assets were not realizable as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and recorded a valuation allowance of $36.8 million and $30.4 million, respectively, to offset the deferred tax assets. The change in valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was an increase of $6.4 million and a decrease of $7.1 million, respectively.
 At December 31, 2018, the Company had federal and Pennsylvania net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $111.9 million, and $105.9 million, respectively. The federal NOLs generated prior to 2018 may be used to offset up to 100% of future taxable income and will begin to expire in 2022, unless previously utilized. The federal NOL generated in 2018 of $20.4 million will be available to offset up to 80% of future taxable income and may be carried forward indefinitely. The Pennsylvania NOLs may be used to offset 40% of future taxable income and will begin to expire in 2029, unless previously utilized.
 At December 31, 2018, the Company also has federal and Pennsylvania research and development tax credit carryforwards totaling $3.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The federal and Pennsylvania research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 and 2029, respectively, unless previously utilized.
 At December 31, 2018, the Company also has federal orphan drug credit carryforwards of $2.8 million, which will begin to expire in 2036, unless previously utilized.
 For all years through December 31, 2018, the Company generated a combination of research and development credits and orphan drug credits. Certain of these credits were derived from studies to document the qualified activities and certain other credits were not derived from studies. For the credits that were calculated through a study, the IRS, on audit, may disagree with the amount of credits calculated. When studies are ultimately performed for the other credits, they may result in an adjustment to those specific credits.
Under the Internal Revenue Code, the utilization of a corporation’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited following a greater than 50% change in ownership over a three-year period. Any unused annual limitation may be carried forward to future years for the balance of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforward period. Under these rules, prior ownership changes may have created a limitation in the Company’s ability to use certain tax carryforwards on a yearly basis. Additionally, certain state operating losses may also be limited, including Pennsylvania, which limits net operating loss carryforward utilization to 35% (40% in 2019 and thereafter) of apportioned taxable income.
 In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to: (i) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (ii) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; (iii) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; and (iv) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.
 The Company applied the guidance in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Act in 2017 and throughout 2018. At December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Act under ASC 740, Income Taxes, related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2018, the Company has now completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Act, and no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017.
 The most significant impact of the Tax Act on the Company's consolidated financial statements was the reduction of $11.0 million of the deferred tax assets related to the net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. The reduction was offset by a change in the Company's valuation allowance. Another significant impact of the Tax Act was to reduce the applicable percentage to be used for the Orphan Drug Credit for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.
 F-23



The Company applies the two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount, which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of ASC 740 and in subsequent periods. This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
 The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state jurisdictions. Tax years 2015 and forward remain open for examination for federal tax purposes and tax years 2015 and forward remain open for examination for the Company’s more significant state tax jurisdictions. To the extent utilized in future years’ tax returns, net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2018 will remain subject to examination until the respective tax year is closed.
 The following table summarizes the activity related to the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):
 
 
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
Gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of the year | $ | 1,293 | | $ | 1,067
Increases related to current year positions | | 362 | | | 226 
Increases related to prior year positions | | 154 | | | — 
Decreases related to prior year positions | | — | | | — 
Expiration of unrecognized tax benefits | | — | | | — 
Gross unrecognized tax benefits at the end of the year | $ | 1,809 | | $ | 1,293

 Due to the Company's valuation allowance, none of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate.
 As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not accrue any interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The Company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly within the next 12 months.

15. | Subsequent Events
----+------------------

 On March 25, 2019, the Company entered into a term loan agreement (the “2019 Loan”) with SVB and WestRiver Innovation Lending Fund VIII, L.P. (“WestRiver”), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $15.0 million, issuable in three separate tranches (“Advances”), of $7.5 million, or Tranche A, which was issued upon execution of the SVB and WestRiver Loan Agreement, $2.5 million available to be issued until May 31, 2019, (“Tranche B”), and $5.0 million (“Tranche C”), which the Company will draw upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones (the “Tranche C milestones”). 
 The maturity date of the 2019 Loan is March 1, 2023. Under the terms of the 2019 Loan, the Company is to make interest-only payments through December 31, 2019 on Tranche A and Tranche B at a rate equal to the greater of the Prime Rate plus 1.00%, as defined in the 2019 Loan, or 6.5%, followed by an amortization period of 39 months of equal monthly payments of principal plus interest amounts until paid in full. The interest-only period will automatically be extended to June 30, 2020 if the Company achieves the Tranche C milestones, followed by an amortization period of 33 months of equal monthly payments of principal plus interest amounts until paid in full. In addition to and not in substitution for the Company’s regular monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest, the Company is required to make a final payment equal to 6% of the aggregate principal amount of the Advances on the maturity date.
 The Company has agreed to issue to SVB and WestRiver warrants to purchase shares of common stock on when we draw on each of Tranche A (an aggregate of 12,131 shares of common stock) and Tranche B (an aggregate of 24,262 shares of common stock), with an exercise price of the lower of the average closing price of the Company’s common stock for the previous ten days of trading or the closing price on the day prior to funding. The warrants are immediately exercisable upon issuance and expire ten years from the date of issuance. 
 Upon execution of the 2019 Loan, the Company drew $7.5 million from Tranche A and repaid the outstanding principal balance and accrued portion of the final payment for the SVB Loan in full.  
The Company’s obligations under the 2019 Loan are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company’s current and future assets, excluding intellectual property. The Company is also obligated to comply with various other customary covenants, including restrictions on the Company’s ability to encumber its intellectual property assets.
