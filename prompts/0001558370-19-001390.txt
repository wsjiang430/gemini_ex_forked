     Item 1. Business
     General
     We are one of the leading commercial real estate services and finance companies in the United States, with a primary focus on multifamily lending. We have been in business for more than 80 years; a Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing™ (“DUS”) lender since 1988, when the DUS program began; a lender with the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) and the Federal Housing Administration, a division of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (together with Ginnie Mae, “HUD”) since acquiring a HUD license in 2009; and a Freddie Mac Multifamily Approved Seller/Servicer for Conventional Loans (“Freddie Mac seller/servicer”) since 2009. We originate,

sell, and service a range of multifamily and other commercial real estate financing products, provide multifamily investment sales brokerage services, and engage in commercial real estate investment management activities. Our clients are owners and developers of multifamily properties and other commercial real estate across the country. We originate and sell multifamily loans through the programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and HUD (collectively, the “Agencies”). We retain servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on substantially all loans that we originate for the Agencies’ programs. We are approved as a Fannie Mae DUS lender nationally, a Freddie Mac seller/servicer nationally, a Freddie Mac targeted affordable housing seller/servicer, a HUD Multifamily Accelerated Processing (“MAP”) lender nationally, a HUD Section 232 LEAN lender nationally, and a Ginnie Mae issuer. We broker, and occasionally service, loans for several life insurance companies, commercial banks, commercial mortgage backed securities (“CMBS”) issuers, and other institutional investors, in which cases we do not fund the loan but rather act as a loan broker. We also underwrite, service, and asset-manage interim loans. Most of these interim loans are closed through a joint venture. Those interim loans not closed by the joint venture are originated by us and held for investment and included on our balance sheet.
     Walker & Dunlop, Inc. is a holding company. We conduct the majority of our operations through Walker & Dunlop, LLC, our operating company.
     Our Product and Service Offerings
     Our product offerings include a range of multifamily and other commercial real estate financing products, including Multifamily Finance, FHA Finance, Capital Markets, and Bridge Financing. We offer a broad range of commercial real estate finance products to our customers, including first mortgage, second trust, supplemental, construction, mezzanine, preferred equity, small-balance, and bridge/interim loans. Our long-established relationships with the Agencies and institutional investors enable us to offer this broad range of loan products and services. We also provide investment sales brokerage services to owners and developers of multifamily properties and commercial real estate investment management services for various investors. Each of our product offerings is designed to maximize our ability to meet client needs, source capital, and grow our commercial real estate finance business.
     The sale of each loan through the Agencies’ programs is negotiated prior to rate locking the loan with the borrower. For loans originated pursuant to the Fannie Mae DUS program, we generally are required to share the risk of loss, with our maximum loss capped at 20% of the loan amount at origination. In addition to our risk-sharing obligations, we may be obligated to repurchase loans that are originated for the Agencies’ programs if certain representations and warranties that we provide in connection with such originations are breached. We have never been required to repurchase a loan. We have established a strong credit culture over decades of originating loans and are committed to disciplined risk management from the initial underwriting stage through loan payoff.
     Multifamily Finance
     We are one of 25 approved lenders that participate in Fannie Mae’s DUS program for multifamily, manufactured housing communities, student housing, affordable housing, and certain seniors housing properties. Under the Fannie Mae DUS program, Fannie Mae has delegated to us responsibility for ensuring that the loans we originate under the Fannie Mae DUS program satisfy the underwriting and other eligibility requirements established from time to time by Fannie Mae. In exchange for this delegation of authority, we share risk for a portion of the losses that may result from a borrower's default. For more information regarding our risk-sharing agreements with Fannie Mae, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Quality and Allowance for Risk-Sharing Obligations” below. Most of the Fannie Mae loans that we originate are sold in the form of a Fannie Mae-guaranteed security to third-party investors. Fannie Mae contracts us to service and asset-manage all loans that we originate under the Fannie Mae DUS program. 
     We are one of 25 lenders approved as a Freddie Mac seller/servicer, where we originate and sell to Freddie Mac multifamily, manufactured housing communities, student housing, affordable housing, and seniors housing loans that satisfy Freddie Mac's underwriting and other eligibility requirements. Under Freddie Mac’s programs, we submit our completed loan underwriting package to Freddie Mac and obtain its commitment to purchase the loan at a specified price after

closing. Freddie Mac ultimately performs its own underwriting of loans that we sell to it. Freddie Mac may choose to hold, sell, or later securitize such loans. We very rarely have any risk-sharing arrangements on loans we sell to Freddie Mac under its program. Freddie Mac contracts us to service and asset-manage all loans that we originate under its program. During 2018, Freddie Mac designated us as one of a select few lenders that is an approved seller/servicer of conventional loans nationally.
     Under certain limited circumstances, we may make preferred equity investments in entities controlled by certain of our borrowers that will assist those borrowers in acquiring and repositioning properties. The terms of such investments are negotiated with each investment.
     FHA Finance
     As an approved HUD MAP and HUD LEAN lender and Ginnie Mae issuer, we provide construction and permanent loans to developers and owners of multifamily housing, affordable housing, seniors housing, and healthcare facilities. We submit our completed loan underwriting package to HUD and obtain HUD's approval to originate the loan. We service and asset-manage all loans originated through HUD’s various programs.
     HUD-insured loans are typically placed in single loan pools which back Ginnie Mae securities. Ginnie Mae is a United States government corporation in the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ginnie Mae securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, and we very rarely bear any risk of loss on Ginnie Mae securities. In the event of a default on a HUD-insured loan, HUD will reimburse approximately 99% of any losses of principal and interest on the loan, and Ginnie Mae will reimburse the remaining losses. We are obligated to continue to advance principal and interest payments and tax and insurance escrow amounts on Ginnie Mae securities until the Ginnie Mae securities are fully paid. 
     Capital Markets
     We serve as an intermediary in the placement of commercial real estate debt between institutional sources of capital, such as life insurance companies, investment banks, commercial banks, pension funds, CMBS issuers, and other institutional investors, and owners of all types of commercial real estate. A client seeking to finance or refinance a property will seek our assistance in developing different alternatives and soliciting interest from various sources of capital. We often advise on capital structure, develop the financing package, facilitate negotiations between our client and institutional sources of capital, coordinate due diligence, and assist in closing the transaction. In these instances, we act as a loan broker and do not underwrite or originate the loan and do not retain any interest in the loan. We service some of these loans.
     Over the past five years, the Company has invested approximately $78.2 million to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of four capital markets brokerage companies. These acquisitions, along with our recruiting efforts, have expanded our network of loan originators, broadened our geographical reach, and provided further diversification to our origination platform.
     Bridge Financing
     We currently offer bridge financing to our borrowers through interim loans and preferred equity investments. The interim loans provide floating-rate, interest-only loans for terms of generally up to three years to experienced borrowers seeking to acquire or reposition multifamily properties that do not currently qualify for permanent financing (the “Interim Program”). We underwrite, service, and asset-manage all loans executed through the Interim Program. The ultimate goal of the Interim Program is to provide permanent Agency financing on these transitional properties. The Interim Program has two distinct executions: Interim Program JV loans and loans held for investment.     Interim Program JV Loans
     During the second quarter of 2017, we formed a joint venture with an affiliate of Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc. 

 
  5

 
to originate, hold, and finance loans that meet the criteria of the Interim Program (the “Interim Program JV” or the “joint venture”). The Interim Program JV assumes full risk of loss while the loans it originates are outstanding. We hold a 15% ownership interest in the Interim Program JV and are responsible for sourcing, underwriting, servicing, and asset-managing the loans originated by the joint venture. The joint venture funds its operations using a combination of equity contributions from its owners and third-party credit facilities.     Loans Held for Investment
     We originate and hold some interim loans for investment, which are included on our balance sheet. During the time that these loans are outstanding, we assume the full risk of loss. We have not experienced any delinquencies or charged off any loans originated and held for investment under the Interim Program. Prior to June 30, 2017, all loans originated through the Interim Program were held for investment. Many of the loans originated since the formation of the joint venture have been Interim Program JV loans. As of December 31, 2018, we had 14 loans held for investment under the Interim Program with an aggregate outstanding unpaid principal balance of $503.5 million.     Preferred Equity Investments
     Under certain limited circumstances, we may make preferred equity investments in entities controlled by certain of our borrowers that will assist those borrowers to acquire and reposition multifamily properties. These borrowers are large, experienced, and well-capitalized and have a well-established relationship with us. The terms of such investments are negotiated with each transaction.     Investment Sales Brokerage Services
     In 2015, we completed our purchase of 75% of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of Engler Financial Group, LLC (“EFG”) and contributed the net assets purchased from EFG to a newly formed subsidiary, Walker & Dunlop Investment Sales, LLC (“WDIS”), through which we conduct our investment sales operations. The acquisition allowed us to begin offering investment sales brokerage services to owners and developers of multifamily properties that are seeking to sell these properties. We seek to maximize proceeds and certainty of closure for our clients using our knowledge of the commercial real estate and capital markets and the experience of our transaction professionals. Our investment sales brokerage services are offered in various regions throughout the United States. We have added several investment sales brokerage teams over the past few years and continue to seek to add other investment sales brokers, with the goal of expanding these brokerage services to cover all major regions throughout the United States.
     We consolidate the activities of WDIS and present the portion of WDIS that we do not control as Noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Net income from noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
     Investment Management
     During the second quarter of 2018, the Company acquired JCR Capital Investment Corporation (“JCR”), an operator, registered investment adviser, and general partner of private commercial real estate investment funds focused on the management of debt, preferred equity, and mezzanine equity investments in private middle-market commercial real estate funds. JCR is also a registered investment adviser to several insurance company separate accounts for which it originates, underwrites, and asset-manages bridge and permanent loans catering to middle market operators. Investors in JCR’s funds include public pension plans, insurance companies, foundations, fund-of-funds, and wealthy individuals. JCR has closed four funds since its founding in 2006 and raised $745.9 million of capital through those funds. Two of those funds are still operating with assets totaling $571.8 million as of December 31, 2018, all of which are managed by JCR.
     The acquisition of JCR, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is part of our strategy to grow and diversify the Company by growing our investment management platform. Prior to the JCR acquisition, our investment management activities were limited.

     Direct Loan Originators and Correspondent Network
     We originate loans directly through loan originators operating out of 29 offices nationwide. At December 31, 2018, we employed 164 loan originators and investment sales brokers. These individuals have deep knowledge of the commercial real estate lending business and bring with them extensive relationships with some of the largest property owners in the country. They have a thorough understanding of the financial needs and objectives of borrowers, the geographic markets in which they operate, market conditions specific to different types of commercial properties, and how to structure a loan product to meet their borrowers’ needs. These loan originators collect and analyze financial and property information, assist the borrower in submitting information required to complete a loan application and, ultimately, help the borrower close the loan. Our loan originators are paid a salary and commissions based on the fees associated with the loans that they originate.
     In addition to our group of loan originators, at December 31, 2018, we had correspondent agreements with 26 independently owned mortgage banking companies across the country with which we have relationships for Agency loan originations. This network of correspondents helps us extend our geographic reach into new and/or smaller markets on a cost-effective basis. In addition to identifying potential borrowers and key principal(s) (the individual or individuals directing the activities of the borrowing entity), our correspondents assist us in evaluating loans, including pre-screening the borrowers, key principal(s), and properties for program eligibility, coordinating due diligence, and generally providing market intelligence. In exchange for providing these services, the correspondent earns an origination fee based on a percentage of the principal amount of the financing arranged and in some cases a fee paid out over time based on the servicing revenues earned over the life of the loan.
    
Underwriting and Risk Management
     We use several tools to manage our Fannie Mae risk-sharing exposure. These tools include an underwriting and approval process that is independent of the loan originator; evaluating and modifying our underwriting criteria given the underlying multifamily housing market fundamentals; limiting our geographic, borrower, and key principal exposures; and using modified risk-sharing under the Fannie Mae DUS program. Similar tools are used to manage our exposure to credit loss on loans originated under the Interim Program.
     Our underwriting process begins with a review of suitability for our investors and a detailed review of the borrower, key principal(s), and the property. We review the borrower's financial statements for minimum net worth and liquidity requirements and obtain credit and criminal background checks. We also review the borrower's and key principal(s)’s operating track records, including evaluating the performance of other properties owned by the borrower and key principal(s). We also consider the borrower's and key principal(s)’s bankruptcy and foreclosure history. We believe that lending to borrowers and key principal(s) with proven track records as operators mitigates our credit risk.
     We review the fundamental value and credit profile of the underlying property, including an analysis of regional economic trends, appraisals of the property, site visits, and reviews of historical and prospective financials. Third-party vendors are engaged for appraisals, engineering reports, environmental reports, flood certification reports, zoning reports, and credit reports. We utilize a list of approved third-party vendors for these reports. Each report is reviewed by our underwriting team for accuracy, quality, and comprehensiveness. All third-party vendors are reviewed periodically for the quality of their work and are removed from our list of approved vendors if the quality or timeliness of the reports is below our standards. This is particularly true for engineering and environmental reports on which we rely to make decisions regarding ongoing replacement reserves and environmental matters.
     In addition, we have concentration limits with respect to our Fannie Mae loans. We limit geographic concentration, focusing on regional employment concentration and trends. We also limit the aggregate amount of loans subject to full risk-sharing for any one borrower. Fannie Mae’s counterparty risk policies require a full risk-sharing cap for individual loans, which is currently set at $200.0 million for us. Our full-risk sharing cap was increased by Fannie Mae in the second quarter of 2018 from $60.0 million to the current level of $200.0 million. Accordingly, our maximum loss exposure on 

 
  7

 
any one loan is $40.0 million (such exposure would occur if the underlying collateral is determined to be completely without value at the time of loss). However, we may request modified risk-sharing at the time of origination, which reduces our potential risk-sharing losses from the levels described above if we do not believe that we are being fairly compensated for the risks of the transaction. 
     Servicing and Asset Management
     We service nearly all loans we originate for the Agencies and our Interim Program and some of the loans we broker for institutional investors, primarily life insurance companies. We may also occasionally leverage the scale of our servicing operation by acquiring the rights to service and asset-manage loans originated by others through direct portfolio acquisitions or entity acquisitions. We are an approved servicer for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and HUD loans. We are currently a rated primary servicer with Fitch Ratings. Our servicing function includes loan servicing and asset management activities, performing or overseeing the following activities:
· | carrying out all cashiering functions relating to the loan, including providing monthly billing statements to the borrower and collecting and applying payments on the loan;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | administering reserve and escrow funds for repairs, tenant improvements, taxes, and insurance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtaining and analyzing financial statements of the borrower and performing periodic property inspections;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparing and providing periodic reports and remittances to the GSEs, investors, master servicers, or other designated persons;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | administering lien filings; and
--+--------------------------------


· | performing other tasks and obligations that are delegated to us.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

      Life insurance companies, whose loans we may service, may perform some or all of the activities identified in the list above. We outsource some of our servicing activities to a subservicer.
     For most loans we service under the Fannie Mae DUS program, we are currently required to advance the principal and interest payments and tax and insurance escrow amounts for four months. We are reimbursed by Fannie Mae for these advances.
     Under the HUD program, we are obligated to advance tax and insurance escrow amounts and principal and interest payments on the Ginnie Mae securities until the Ginnie Mae security is fully paid. In the event of a default on a HUD-insured loan, we can elect to assign the loan to HUD and file a mortgage insurance claim. HUD will reimburse approximately 99% of any losses of principal and interest on the loan, and Ginnie Mae will reimburse substantially all of the remaining losses. In cases where we elect to not assign the loan to HUD, we attempt to mitigate losses to HUD by assisting the borrower to obtain a modification to the loan that will improve the borrower’s likelihood of future performance.
     Our Growth Strategy
     We believe we are positioned to continue growing and diversifying our business by taking advantage of opportunities in the commercial real estate finance and services market. In 2016, the Company implemented a strategy to reach at least $1 billion of annual revenues by the end of 2020 by accomplishing the following milestones: (i) $30 to $35 billion of annual loan origination volume, (ii) annual investment sales volume of $8 to $10 billion, (iii) an unpaid principal balance of at least $100 billion in our servicing portfolio, and (iv) $8 to $10 billion of assets under management. To reach these milestones, we will focus on the following areas:
· | Defend Our Market Position as a Leading Provider of Capital to Multifamily Borrowers. We intend to further grow our Agency loan originations with the goal of increasing our market share with the GSEs and remaining a top five lender of HUD products. For 2018, we ranked as the second largest Fannie Mae DUS lender, and we ranked as the fourth largest Freddie Mac seller/servicer. Additionally, we were ranked as the third largest multifamily lender for HUD in 2018 based on MAP initial endorsements. At December 31, 2018, our origination platform had approximately 60 loan originators focused on selling Agency

products, supplemented by 26 independently owned mortgage banking companies with whom we have correspondent relationships. We believe that we will have significant opportunities to continue broadening our Agency loan origination networks to maintain or grow our market share. This expansion may include organic growth, recruitment of talented origination professionals, and potential acquisitions of competitors with strong origination capabilities.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to Expand our Capital Markets Team. At December 31, 2018, we had 87 loan originators in 20 offices focused on capital markets transactions across the United States. Over the past five years, we have added 63 net new loan originators to our capital markets team through recruiting and the acquisition of the loan origination platforms of four companies. We intend to continue growing our capital markets team to strengthen our market position and borrower relationships and to grow our market share. Continued growth of our capital markets team will provide greater exposure to the overall commercial real estate market, expose us to new correspondent relationships, and provide us with institutional access to deal flow supporting our bridge lending solutions. In addition, many of our capital markets loan originators also originate loans through the Agencies’ programs, assisting our growth objectives with the Agencies.

· | Continue to Expand our Investment Sales Team. At December 31, 2018, we had 17 investment sales brokers in nine offices located in various regions throughout the United States. We have more than tripled the number of our investment sales brokers since we acquired an investment sales company in 2015. We intend to continue growing our investment sales team to broaden our market position and borrower relationships and to grow our market share. Continued growth of our investment sales team will provide greater exposure to the multifamily market. In addition, we are able to capture additional loan origination volume as our loan originators, working with our investment sales brokers are successful at arranging the financing for many of our investment sales transactions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to Develop Proprietary Sources of Capital. Since our initial public offering, we have expanded our product offerings to include the Interim Program and investment management. We continue to explore partnering with additional sources of third-party capital and acquiring additional investment management platforms, which will allow us to offer an expanded array of commercial real estate loan products to our clients as their financial needs evolve, while generating positive returns for the third-party capital. We believe that we have the structuring, underwriting, servicing, credit, and asset management expertise to expand these commercial real estate loan products and services and our investment management platform; and we believe that cash on hand, together with third-party financing sources and our continued cash generation, will allow us to meet client demand for additional products that are within our areas of expertise, including for our balance sheet or for our partnerships or future funds.

  If we are successful in achieving all or most of the growth objectives noted above, we believe we can achieve the financial milestones by the end of 2020, generating at least $1 billion of annual revenues.
     Competition
     We compete in the commercial real estate services industry. We are one of 25 approved lenders that participate in Fannie Mae’s DUS program and one of 25 lenders approved as a Freddie Mac seller/servicer. We face significant competition across our business, including, but not limited to, commercial real estate services subsidiaries of large national commercial banks, privately-held and public commercial real estate service providers, CMBS conduits, public and private real estate investment trusts, private equity, investment funds, and insurance companies, some of which are also investors in loans we originate. Our competitors include, but are not limited to, Wells Fargo, N.A.; CBRE Group, Inc.; Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated; Marcus & Millichap, Inc.; HFF, Inc.; Eastdil Secured (a subsidiary of Wells Fargo, N.A.); PNC Real Estate; Northmarq Capital, LLC; Newmark Realty Capital; and Berkadia Commercial Mortgage, LLC. Many of these competitors enjoy advantages over us, including greater name recognition, financial resources, well-established investment management platforms, and access to lower-cost capital. The commercial real estate services subsidiaries of the large 

 
  9

 
national commercial banks may have an advantage over us in originating commercial loans if borrowers already have other lending relationships with the bank.
     We compete on the basis of quality of service, speed of execution, relationships, loan structure, terms, pricing, breadth of product offerings, and industry depth. Industry depth includes the knowledge of local and national real estate market conditions, loan product expertise, and the ability to analyze and manage credit risk. Our competitors seek to compete aggressively on these factors. Our success depends on our ability to offer attractive loan products, provide superior service, demonstrate industry depth, maintain and capitalize on relationships with investors, borrowers, and key loan correspondents, and remain competitive in pricing. In addition, future changes in laws, regulations, and Agency program requirements, increased investment from foreign entities, and consolidation in the commercial real estate finance market could lead to the entry of more competitors.
     Regulatory Requirements
     Our business is subject to laws and regulations in a number of jurisdictions. The level of regulation and supervision to which we are subject varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is based on the type of business activities involved. The regulatory requirements that apply to our activities are subject to change from time to time and may become more restrictive, making our compliance with applicable requirements more difficult or expensive or otherwise restricting our ability to conduct our business in the manner that it is now conducted. Changes in applicable regulatory requirements, including changes in their enforcement, could materially and adversely affect us.     Federal and State Regulation of Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities
     Our multifamily and commercial real estate lending, servicing, and asset management businesses are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the United States. In addition, these businesses may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things, regulate lending activities, regulate conduct with borrowers, establish maximum interest rates, finance charges, and other charges and require disclosures to borrowers. Although most states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates, as well as other charges on certain collection practices and creditor remedies. Some states also require licensing of lenders, loan brokers, and loan servicers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. We also are required to comply with certain provisions of, among other statutes and regulations, the USA PATRIOT Act, regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, which we refer to as “ERISA,” and federal and state securities laws and regulations.
     Requirements of the Agencies
     To maintain our status as an approved lender for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and as a HUD-approved mortgagee and issuer of Ginnie Mae securities, we are required to meet and maintain various eligibility criteria from time to time established by the Agencies, such as minimum net worth, operational liquidity and collateral requirements, and compliance with reporting requirements. We also are required to originate our loans and perform our loan servicing functions in accordance with the applicable program requirements and guidelines from time to time established by the Agencies. If we fail to comply with the requirements of any of these programs, the Agencies may terminate or withdraw our approval. In addition, the Agencies have the authority under their guidelines to terminate a lender's authority to sell loans to them and service their loans. The loss of one or more of these approvals would have a material adverse impact on us and could result in further disqualification with other counterparties, and we may be required to obtain additional state lender or mortgage banker licensing to originate loans if that status is revoked.
     Investment Advisers Act
     Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, JCR is required to be registered as an investment adviser with the SEC and follow the various rules and regulations applicable to investment advisers. These rules and regulations cover, among 

 
  10

 
other areas, communications with investors, marketing materials provided to potential investors, disclosure and calculation of fees, calculation and reporting of performance information, maintenance of books and records, and custody. Investment advisers are also subject to periodic inspection and examination by the SEC and filing requirements on Form ADV and Form PF. Should JCR not meet any of the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act, it could face, among other things, fines, penalties, legal proceedings, an order to cease and desist, or revocation of its registration.
     Employees
