ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Legal Organization
Conifer Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: CNFR) is a Michigan‑domiciled insurance holding company formed in 2009. Our principal executive offices are located at 550 W. Merrill, Suite 200, Birmingham, MI 48009 (telephone number: (248) 559-0840). Our corporate website address is www.cnfrh.com.
As used in this Form 10-K, references to “Conifer,” “Conifer Holdings,” “the Company,” “our Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Conifer Holdings, Inc., a Michigan corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries Conifer Insurance Company (“CIC”), Red Cedar Insurance Company (“RCIC”), White Pine Insurance Company (“WPIC”), American Colonial Insurance Services and Sycamore Insurance Agency, Inc. (“SIA”). CIC, RCIC and WPIC are collectively referred to as the "Insurance Company Subsidiaries." On a stand-alone basis Conifer Holdings, Inc. is referred to as the "Parent Company." On December 30, 2016, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, American Colonial Insurance Company ("ACIC") was merged into WPIC. 
Business Overview
Through our Insurance Company Subsidiaries, we offer insurance coverage in both specialty commercial and specialty personal product lines. Currently, we are authorized to write insurance as an excess and surplus lines (“E&S”) carrier in 45 states including the District of Columbia. We are also licensed to write insurance in 42 states, including the District of Columbia, as an admitted carrier and we offer our insurance products in all 50 states. 
Our revenues are primarily derived from premiums earned from our insurance operations. We also generate other revenues through investment income and other income which mainly consists of: installment fees and policy issuance fees generally related to the policies we write.
Many of our products are targeted to traditionally profitable classes of policyholders that we believe are underserved by other insurers. We market and sell these insurance products through a growing network of over 7,000 independent agents that distribute our policies through approximately 2,100 sales offices. We are focused on growing our business in non‑commoditized property and casualty insurance markets, while maintaining underwriting discipline and a conservative investment strategy. 
We have substantial expertise in serving the unique commercial insurance needs of owner‑operated businesses in the following markets:

• | Hospitality, such as restaurants, bars, taverns, and bowling centers (that require, among other lines, liquor liability insurance), as well as small grocery and convenience stores;


• | Artisan contractors, such as plumbers, painters, carpenters, electricians and other independent contractors; and


• | Security service providers, such as companies that provide security guard services, security alarm products and services, and private investigative services.

In our commercial lines business, we seek to differentiate ourselves and provide value to small business owner‑operators by bundling different insurance products that meet a significant portion of their insurance needs. For example, in the hospitality market we offer property, casualty, and liquor liability, as well as, in some jurisdictions, workers’ compensation coverage. The breadth of our specialty commercial insurance products enables our agents and their small business clients to avoid the administrative costs and time required to seek coverage for each of these items from separate insurers. As such, we compete for commercial lines business based on our flexible product offerings and customer service, rather than on pricing alone. Our target commercial lines customer has an average account size of $5,500 in premium.
We also have substantial expertise in providing specialty homeowners insurance products to targeted customers that are often underserved by other homeowners' insurance carriers. Our personal lines products primarily include the following:

• | Low-value dwelling insurance tailored for owners of lower valued homes, which we currently offer in Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana and Texas; and

1


• | Wind-exposed catastrophe coverage, including hurricane and wind coverage, to under-served homeowners in Texas and Florida.

In our personal lines business, we target homeowners in need of specific catastrophe coverage or dwelling insurance that are currently underserved by the insurance market, due to the modest value of their homes or the exposure to natural catastrophes in their geographic area. Because these homeowners are underserved, this portion of the market is typically subject to less pricing pressure from larger nationwide insurers that offer a more commoditized product. We believe our underwriting expertise enables us to compete effectively in these markets by evaluating and appropriately pricing risk. In addition, we believe our willingness to meet these underserved segments of the personal lines insurance market fosters deeper relationships with, and increased loyalty from, the agents who distribute our products. Our target personal lines customer has an average account size of $1,100 in premium.
Overall, we structure the multi-line distribution of our premium between commercial and personal lines to better diversify our business and mitigate the potential cyclical nature of either market. In serving these markets, we write business on both an “admitted” and “E&S” basis. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 49% of our gross written premiums were admitted, and approximately 51% were E&S. Insurance companies writing on an admitted basis are licensed by the states in which they sell policies and are required to offer policies using premium rates and forms that are typically filed with state insurance regulators. Non admitted carriers writing in the E&S market are not bound by most of the rate and form regulations imposed on standard market companies, allowing them the flexibility to change the coverage offered and the rate charged without the time constraints and financial costs associated with the filing process. Our corporate structure allows us to offer both admitted and E&S products in select markets through either CIC or WPIC. Our experience with specialty insurance products enables us to react to new market opportunities and underwrite multiple specialty lines.
Geographic Diversity and Mix of Business
Over the past several years, we have increased our focus on specific core commercial lines of business. As part of this business strategy, we have deemphasized our Florida homeowners' business and other wind-exposed business in Texas and Hawaii. We plan to continue to shift focus to low-value dwelling lines of business in order to bring personal lines premium levels back up and to maintain a strategic balance of commercial and personal lines of business.
While we pursue top line premium growth, we do not do so at the expense of losing underwriting discipline. Our underwriters have the experience and institutional flexibility to recognize when to exit certain products in favor of more profitable opportunities as insurance market conditions dictate. The following tables summarize our gross written premiums by segment and state for the years indicated therein (dollars in thousands):

 | Gross Written Premium by Segment
 | 2018 | % | | 2017 | % | | 2016 | %

 The Conifer Approach
We have built our business in a manner that is designed to adapt to changing market conditions and deliver predictable results over time. The following highlights key aspects of our model that contribute to our balanced approach:

• | Focus on under-served markets. We focus on providing specialty insurance products to targeted policyholders in under-served markets. We believe that most of our small business customers, many of which are owner‑operated, value the efficiency of dealing with a single insurer for multiple products. By targeting small- to medium-sized accounts, we add value to the business owner directly without competing solely on price. 


• | Strong relationships with our agents. We develop strong relationships with our independent agents providing them with responsive service, attractive commissions and competitive products to offer policyholders. We believe our agents understand that we view them as key partners in risk selection that help us serve our ultimate client-the insured. 


• | Deep understanding of the business and regulatory landscapes of our markets. The competition for insurance business and the regulatory operating environment vary significantly from state to state. We focus on tailoring our business to concentrate on the geographic markets and regulatory environments with the greatest opportunities for growth and profitability. Our business plan centers on identification of market opportunities in jurisdictions where our insurance products can profitably suit the needs of our potential customers. 


• | Emphasis on flexibility. We offer coverage to our insureds both on an E&S and admitted basis. We believe this flexibility enables us to pivot effectively between E&S and admitted policies as customer needs and regulatory conditions dictate. 


• | Conservative risk management with an emphasis on lowering volatility. We focus on the risk/reward of insurance underwriting, while maintaining a prudent investment policy. We employ conservative risk management practices and opportunistically purchase reinsurance to minimize our exposure to liability for individual risks. In addition, we seek to maintain a diversified liquid investment portfolio to reduce overall balance sheet volatility. As of December 31, 2018, our investments primarily consisted of fixed income investments with an average credit rating of “AA” and a duration-to-worst average of 3.1 years. 

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths have allowed us to grow our business and will continue to support our strategic growth initiatives:

• | Talented underwriters with broad expertise. Our underwriters have significant experience managing account profitability across market cycles. With an average of over 27 years of experience, our senior underwriters possess the required expertise to respond appropriately to market forces. 

3


• | Controlled and disciplined underwriting. We underwrite substantially all policies to our specific guidelines with our experienced, in-house underwriting team. We customize the coverages we offer, and continually monitor our markets and respond to changes in our markets by adjusting our pricing, product structures and underwriting guidelines. By tailoring the terms and conditions of our policies, we align our actual underwriting risk with the profit of each insurance account that we write. 


• | Proactive claims handling. We employ a proactive claims handling philosophy that utilizes an internal team of experienced in-house attorneys to manage and supervise our claims from inception until resolution. We pay what we owe, contest what we don't, and make sound judgment for those claims that fall in between. Our proactive handling of claims reinforces our relationships with our customers and agents by demonstrating our willingness to defend our insureds aggressively and help them mitigate losses. 


• | Proven management team. Our senior management team has an average of over 25 years of experience in the insurance industry. Our senior management team has successfully created, managed and grown numerous insurance companies and books of business, and has longstanding relationships with many independent agents and policyholders in our targeted markets. 


• | Ability to leverage technology to drive efficiency. We utilize a web‑based information technology system that creates greater organizational efficiency in our company. Leveraging the infrastructure of programmers and support staff of third‑party vendors allows our in‑house business analysts to focus on new product development and roll‑out. We believe this capability reduces our time to market for new products, enhances services for insureds, increases our ability to capture data, and reduces cost. 

Marketing and Distribution
Independent agents are our main distribution source. The selection of an insurance company by a business or individual is strongly influenced by the business or individual’s agent. We seek to maintain favorable relationships with our select group of agents. Our distribution philosophy is to treat our agents as partners, and we provide them with competitive products, personal service and attractive commissions. We believe these factors contribute to our positive agency retention.
In 2018, our top six independent agencies accounted for approximately 32% of our gross written premiums in our commercial lines, and our top four independent agencies, accounted for approximately 40% of our gross written premiums in our personal lines. We have long term relationships with each of these agencies. We anticipate our concentration in these agencies will decrease in future periods as we establish relationships with additional agencies, as part of our strategic growth plan. Our Insurance Company Subsidiaries market and distribute their products mainly through an independent agency network, however we utilize managing general agents and certain key wholesalers when appropriate.
We recruit our producers through referrals from our existing network of agents, word‑of‑mouth, advertisement, as well as direct contacts initiated by potential agents. Our marketing efforts are directed through our offices in Michigan, Florida, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
We view our agents as key partners in risk selection. We actively solicit their input regarding potential improvements to our business methods and consult with them in developing new products and entering new customer markets. At the same time, we take careful measure to appropriately control and monitor our agents’ operations. Controls include frequent review of the quality of business, loss experience and other mechanisms. We retain sole binding authority on the majority of our business. Binding authority is only granted to select long-term agents. When binding authority is granted, we restrict this authority to a specific set of guidelines that are provided to each agent. Moreover, our experienced underwriters review each risk to ensure the guidelines are followed.
In addition to marketing to individual agents, we formed Sycamore Insurance Agency to review specific opportunities to write select business on a direct basis. SIA also owns 50% of a small insurance agency that places small commercial risks, mainly for alarm and security guard markets.
Underwriting
We are focused on underwriting profitability and effective enterprise risk management. With an average of over 27 years of experience, our senior underwriters have the experience to properly manage account profitability across market cycles.
Our underwriting philosophy for our specialty commercial risks in the hospitality industry is to look at each risk individually and selectively before writing any policies. We remain focused on the small to medium-sized, well-operated business, where the owner is often on site and in a better position to efficiently and safely run the overall operations. We understand the risks associated with the smaller enterprises and, due to lighter competition, believe we can receive a fair premium to compensate for the risk taken.

With respect to commercial property coverages, we believe it is important to focus on the profitability of the insureds’ business, as well as the traditional risk factors. Therefore, in addition to obtaining inspections on commercial risks, we strive to understand the insureds’ business operations and bottom line to verify the underlying business is an acceptable risk. 
All commercial and personal policy applications are underwritten according to established guidelines that have been provided to our independent agency force. These guidelines have been integrated into our information technology system framework and only policies that meet our guidelines are accepted by our system. Our underwriting staff has substantial industry experience in matching policy terms, conditions, and pricing to the risk profiles of our policyholders and therefore strengthens our ability to achieve profitability in the product lines we write.
Commercial Lines. In writing commercial lines policies, we frequently employ tailored limiting endorsements, rating surcharges and customized limits to align our product offerings to the risk profile of the class and the specific policyholder being underwritten. Furthermore, we consistently monitor our markets so that we are able to quickly implement changes in pricing, underwriting guidelines and product offerings as necessary to remain competitive. We do not pursue commercial product lines where competition is based primarily on price. We augment our own internally developed pricing models with benchmark rates and policy terms set forth by the Insurance Services Office, or ISO. The ISO system is a widely recognized industry resource for common and centralized rates and forms. It provides advisory ratings, statistical and actuarial services, sample policy provisions and other services to its members.
Personal Lines. We employ internal product managers to review our position relative to our competition, create better segmentation of pricing and originate premium rate changes as appropriate. Consistent with industry practice, we grant our personal lines agents limited binding authority within our specific guidelines. Once a completed application and premium payment are submitted to us, the application is placed in a bound status, and reviewed for final approval. If the agent has underwritten and submitted the account according to our guidelines, we process the application as complete. If our guidelines have not been followed, the application may be cancelled or updated and re‑submitted for further underwriting review. 
Claims
We believe that effective claims management is vitally important to our success, allowing us to cost effectively pay valid claims, while vigorously defending those claims that lack merit. Our claims department consists of experienced claims professionals located in Michigan, Florida, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. We utilize a proactive claims handling philosophy to internally manage or supervise all of our claims from inception through final disposition. By handling our claims internally, we can quickly assess claims, improve communication with our policyholders and claimants and better control our claims management costs.
We have several in‑house attorneys with considerable legal experience in trying cases in the lines of business we write. Included among these attorneys is our head in‑house litigator, who consults on all trials and has 25 years of litigation experience. We also have numerous seasoned property and liability adjusters which allow us to manage our claims exposures more carefully, across all markets. In addition, our claims professionals utilize a network of independent local adjusters and appraisers to assist with specific aspects of claims investigations, such as securing witness statements and conducting initial appraisals in states where it is practical to do so. These outside vendors are mainly compensated based on pre‑negotiated fee schedules to control overall costs.
Claims personnel are organized by line of business, with specific managers assigned as supervisors for each line of business. Reserving and payment authority levels of claims personnel are set by our Senior Vice President of claims and our Executive Vice President. Those limits of authority are integrated into our claims information technology systems to ensure strict compliance.
Initial claim reserves are determined and set using our statistical averages of paid indemnity and loss adjustment expenses by line of business. After reviewing statistical data and consulting with our internal actuary, our senior vice president of claims, together with other members of management, set initial reserves by line of business. Once initial reserves have been set, reserves are evaluated periodically as specific claim information changes to generate management’s overall best estimate of reserves. In addition, claim reviews with in‑house adjusters and attorneys provide a regular opportunity to review the adequacy of reserves. Changes to claims reserves are made by senior management based on claim developments and input from these attorneys and adjusters. We utilize an in‑house, experienced and fully credentialed actuary to support our financial efforts. 
5

Reinsurance
We routinely purchase reinsurance for our commercial and personal lines to reduce volatility by limiting our exposure to large losses and to provide capacity for growth. In a reinsurance transaction, an insurance company transfers, or cedes, all or part of its exposure in return for a portion of the premium. We remain legally responsible for the entire obligation to policyholders, irrespective of any reinsurance coverage we may purchase.
Information relating to our reinsurance structure and treaty information is included within Note 6 ~ Reinsurance.

Data from 2009 relates only to American Equable, Inc., which is now known as CIC and the 2010 through 2018 columns include CIC and WPIC.
The first line of the table presents the unpaid loss and LAE reserves at December 31 for each year, including the incurred but not reported ("IBNR") reserve. The next section of the table sets forth the re‑estimates of incurred losses from later years, including payments, for the years indicated. The increase/decrease from the original estimate would generally be a combination of factors, including, but not limited to:

• | Claims being settled for amounts different from the original estimates;


• | Reserves being increased or decreased for individual claims that remain open as more information becomes known about those individual claims; and


• | More or fewer claims being reported after the related year end, than had been expected to be reported before that date.

As our historical data for a particular line of business increases, both in terms of the number of years of loss experience and the size of our data pool, we will increasingly rely upon our own loss experience rather than industry loss experience in establishing our loss and LAE reserves. We plan to continue to apply reserving practices consistent with historical methodologies.
Additional information relating to our reserves is included within the Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses section of Note 1 ~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 ~ Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as in the Critical Accounting Policies ~ Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses section of Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
Regulation
Insurance Company Regulation
Our Insurance Company Subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the states where they conduct business. State insurance regulations generally are designed to protect the interests of policyholders, consumers or claimants rather than shareholders or other investors. The nature and extent of such state regulation varies by jurisdiction, but generally involves:

• | Prior approval of the acquisition of control of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company;


• | Regulation of certain transactions entered into by such insurance company subsidiary with any of its affiliates;


• | Approval of premium rates, forms and policies used for many lines of admitted insurance;


• | Standards of solvency and minimum amounts of capital and surplus that must be maintained;


• | Limitations on types and concentration of investments;


• | Licensing of insurers and agents;


• | Deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; and


• | The filing of periodic reports with state insurance regulators with respect to financial condition and other matters.

In addition, state regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. The results of these examinations can give rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive or other corrective action.
Insurance Holding Company Regulation
We operate as an insurance holding company and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These regulations require that each of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. The insurance laws similarly provide that all transactions among members of a holding company system must be fair and reasonable. Certain types of transactions between our Insurance Company Subsidiaries and the Company and our other affiliates generally must be disclosed to the state regulators, and prior approval of the state insurance regulator generally is required for any material or extraordinary transaction. In addition, a change of control of a domestic insurer or of any controlling person requires the prior approval of the state of domicile insurance regulator.
8

Various State and Federal Regulation
Insurance companies are also affected by a variety of state and federal legislative and regulatory measures and judicial decisions that define and extend the risks and benefits for which insurance is sought and provided. In addition, for some classes of insureds individual state insurance departments may prevent premium rates for some classes of insureds from reflecting the level of risk assumed by the insurer for those classes. Such developments may adversely affect the profitability of various lines of insurance. In some cases, if permitted by applicable regulations, these adverse effects on profitability can be minimized through repricing of coverages or limitations or cessation of the affected business.
Reinsurance Intermediary
Our reinsurance intermediaries are also subject to regulation. Under applicable regulations, an intermediary is responsible, as a fiduciary, for funds received on account of the parties to the reinsurance transaction. The intermediaries are required to hold such funds in appropriate bank accounts subject to restrictions on withdrawals and prohibitions on commingling.
Licensing and Agency Contracts
We, or certain of our designated employees, must be licensed to act as agents by regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business. Regulations and licensing laws vary in each state and are often complex.
Insurance licenses are issued by state insurance regulators upon application and may be of perpetual duration or may require periodic renewal. There are often requirements to obtain appropriate new licenses before we can begin writing or offer new coverages in a new state. The requirements are more stringent when writing on an admitted basis, as opposed to on an E&S basis where there is greater form and rate flexibility.
Insurers operating on an admitted basis must file premium rate schedules and policy or coverage forms for review and approval by the insurance regulators. In many states, rates and policy forms must be approved prior to use, and insurance regulators have broad discretion in judging whether or not an insurer’s rates are adequate, excessive and unfairly discriminatory.
The applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities, and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting, revocation, suspension and renewal of licenses. We, or our employees, could be excluded, or temporarily suspended, from continuing with some or all of our activities in, or otherwise subjected to penalties by, a particular state.
Membership in Insolvency Funds and Associations, Mandatory Pools and Insurance Facilities
Most states require admitted property and casualty insurers to become members of insolvency funds or associations, which generally protect policyholders against the insolvency of insurers. Members of the fund or association must contribute to the payment of certain claims made against insolvent insurers. The Company's assessments from insolvency funds were minimal for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
Our Insurance Company Subsidiaries are also required to participate in various mandatory insurance facilities or in funding mandatory pools, which are generally designed to provide insurance coverage for consumers who are unable to obtain insurance in the voluntary insurance market. Among the pools participated in are those established in certain states to provide windstorm and other similar types of property coverage. These pools typically require all companies writing applicable lines of insurance in the state for which the pool has been established to fund deficiencies experienced by the pool based upon each company’s relative premium writings in that state, with any excess funding typically distributed to the participating companies on the same basis. To the extent that reinsurance treaties do not cover these assessments, they may have an adverse effect on the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, total assessments paid to all such facilities were minimal.

NAIC-IRIS Ratios
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (“NAIC”) Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies “usual values” for each ratio. Departure from the usual values on four or more ratios generally leads to inquiries or possible further review from individual state insurance commissioners. However, the generation of ratios outside of the usual values does not necessarily indicate a financial problem. For example, premium growth, alone, can trigger one or more unusual values. Refer to the Regulatory and Rating Issues section within Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
Effect of Federal Legislation
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, (“TRIA”), was enacted in November 2002. After several extensions, Congress enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization of 2015 (“Act”). The Act extends the Federal Terrorism Insurance Program until December 31, 2020. The Act continues to require insurance companies to offer terrorism coverage. There is minimal exposure to this coverage as most of our policyholders decline this coverage option.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had 148 employees. Substantially all of our employees are full-time. Our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement, and we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such an agreement. We believe we have good working relations with our employees.

Glossary 

Accident year | The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid. 
Accident year combined ratio | The accident year combined ratio is an insurance industry measure that excludes changes in net ultimate loss estimates from prior accident year loss reserves. The accident year combined ratio provides management with an assessment of the specific policy year’s profitability (which matches policy pricing with related losses) and assists management in their evaluation of product pricing levels and quality of business written. Management uses accident year combined ratio as one component to assess the Company's current year performance and as a measure to evaluate, and if necessary, adjust current year pricing and underwriting.
Adjusted operating income (loss) | Net income (loss) excluding net realized investment and other gains (losses), net of tax, the effects of tax reform, the tax effect of changes in unrealized gains to the extent included in net income, the change in the fair value of equity securities, net of tax, and the capitalization and amortization of deferred gains from the ADC. 
Adjusted operating income (loss), per share | Adjusted operating income (loss) on a per share basis. 
Assignment of Benefits | A legal tool that allows a third party to assert a claim and be paid for services performed for an insured who would normally be reimbursed directly by the insurance company after making a claim themselves. 
Book value per share | Total common shareholders' equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding. 
Case reserves | Estimates of anticipated future payments to be made on each specific reported claim. 
Combined Ratio based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) | The Combined Ratio is the sum of the Loss Ratio and the Expense Ratio. These ratios differ from statutory ratios to reflect GAAP accounting, as management evaluates the performance of our underwriting operations using the GAAP combined ratio. 
Combined Ratio based on statutory accounting practices (“SAP”) | The combined ratio based on SAP, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance business. The combined ratio is a statutory accounting measurement, which represents the sum of (i) the ratio of losses and loss expenses to net earned premiums (loss ratio), plus (ii) the ratio of underwriting expenses to net written premiums (expense ratio). 
Combined Ratio (Overall) | When the combined ratio is under 100%, underwriting results are generally considered profitable; when the combined ratio is over 100%, underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable. 
Deferred policy acquisition costs | Primarily commissions and premium-related taxes that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of new contracts and are deferred and amortized to achieve a matching of revenues and expenses when reported in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Deficiency | With regard to reserves for a given liability, a deficiency exists when it is estimated or determined that the reserves are insufficient to pay the ultimate settlement value of the related liabilities. Where the deficiency is the result of an estimate, the estimated amount of deficiency (or even the finding of whether or not a deficiency exists) may change as new information becomes available. 
Expense Ratio | For GAAP, it is the ratio of GAAP underwriting expenses incurred to net earned premiums plus other income. For SAP, it is the ratio of Statutory underwriting expenses incurred to net written premiums. 
Incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves | Reserves for estimated losses and LAE that have been incurred but not yet reported to the insurer. This includes amounts for unreported claims, development on known cases, and re-opened claims. 
Loss | An occurrence that is the basis for submission and/or payment of a claim. Losses may be covered, limited or excluded from coverage, depending on the terms of the policy. 
Loss adjustment expenses (LAE) | The expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs. 
Loss ratio | The ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums plus other income. 
Loss reserves | Liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to reflect the estimated cost of claims incurred that the insurer or reinsurer will ultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance or reinsurance it has written. Reserves are established for losses and for LAE, and consist of case reserves and IBNR reserves. As the term is used in this document, “loss reserves” is meant to include reserves for both losses and LAE, unless stated otherwise.
Loss reserve development | The increase or decrease in Loss or LAE as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development. 
Losses incurred | The total losses sustained by an insurance company under a policy or policies, whether paid or unpaid. Incurred losses include a provision for IBNR. 
NAIC-IRIS ratios | Financial ratios calculated by the NAIC to assist state insurance departments in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. 
Policyholders' surplus | As determined under SAP, the amount remaining after all liabilities, including loss reserves, are subtracted from all admitted assets. Admitted assets are assets of an insurer prescribed or permitted by a state to be recognized on the statutory balance sheet. Policyholders' surplus is also referred to as “surplus” or “statutory surplus” for statutory accounting purposes. 
Premium leverage ratio | The ratio of written premium (gross or net) to consolidated statutory surplus. 
Redundancy | With regard to reserves for a given liability, a redundancy exists when it is estimated or determined that the reserves are greater than what will be needed to pay the ultimate settlement value of the related liabilities. Where the redundancy is the result of an estimate, the estimated amount of redundancy (or even the finding of whether or not a redundancy exists) may change as new information becomes available. 
Risk-Based Capital (RBC) | A measure adopted by the NAIC and enacted by states for determining the minimum statutory policyholders' surplus requirements of insurers. Insurers having total adjusted capital less than that required by the RBC calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action. 
Statutory accounting practices (SAP) | The practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by domiciliary state insurance regulatory authorities in the United States for recording transactions and preparing financial statements. 
Underwriting gain or loss | Net earned premiums plus other income, less losses, LAE, commissions, and operating expenses.
