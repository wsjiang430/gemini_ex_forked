Item 1. Business
i3 Verticals, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation on January 17, 2018 for the purpose of completing an initial public offering (“IPO”) of its Class A common stock and other related transactions in order to carry on the business of i3 Verticals, LLC and its subsidiaries. The Company’s headquarters are in Nashville, Tennessee, with operations throughout the United States. The terms “i3 Verticals,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” and similar references refer (1) before the completion of our IPO or the reorganization transactions entered into in connection therewith (the “Reorganization Transactions”), which are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements, to i3 Verticals, LLC and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries, and (2) after the Reorganization Transactions to i3 Verticals, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries.
Our Company
Recognizing the convergence of software and payments, i3 Verticals was founded in 2012 with the purpose of delivering seamless integrated payment and software solutions to SMBs and organizations in strategic vertical markets. 
Since commencing operations, we have built a broad suite of payment and software solutions that address the specific needs of SMBs and other organizations in our strategic vertical markets, and we believe our suite of solutions differentiates us from our competition.
We primarily focus on strategic vertical markets where we believe we can be a leader in vertically-focused, integrated payment and software solutions. Our strategic vertical markets include:
•Education—We assist schools in completing payment processing functions such as accepting payments for school lunches (online, at school, or at the point-of-sale (“POS”)) and school activities, selling products from the online student store while managing inventory, ticket sales while tracking attendance at athletic and other events, enabling parents and students to complete forms electronically and enabling parents to make installment payments on higher-priced items. Our education solutions, which utilize the payment facilitator model, are self-serve payment and data collection software platforms that manage critical parent and student information via web, mobile, and on-site transaction processing. Using our convenience-fee payment technology, our school clients in this vertical often receive the full principal amount which alleviates reconciliation issues and processing costs.
•Public Sector—We have products and solutions that create an efficient flow of information throughout a variety of public sector entities. We also deliver integrated payment solutions in our public-sector vertical. These solutions allow our clients to process court, tax, utility billing, bail, and other public-sector payments, typically utilizing the payment facilitator model. Convenience-fee payment technology is also available to our public sector clients.
•Non-profit—We deliver an integrated solution for processing payments from donors to non-profit organizations. These solutions assist non-profit organizations with ordinary course fundraising along with special one-time or “giving day” promotions that may include many separate organizations seeking donations within a single marketing campaign. Our integrated solutions seamlessly integrate into the business management system for each respective non-profit to allow for efficient data capture and reporting.
•Property Management—We assist landlords and property managers in the rent collection process by providing centralized reporting for card and automated clearing house (“ACH”) payments, bank-level Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”) compliant security and solutions that integrate with third-party accounting software. Our instruction-based funding model, enabled by our payment facilitator platform, accommodates complex fund distribution to multiple depository accounts, which is important to property managers and landlords.
•Healthcare—We provide businesses in our healthcare vertical with an integrated solution for processing payments from patients for various healthcare-related costs and fees. These payment solutions seamlessly integrate into our distribution partner independent software vendor (“ISV”) software to provide clients and their customers a bundled card payment solution. These ISV relationships promote our integrated payment solutions in a one-to-many fashion to prospective clients. 
We target vertical markets where businesses and organizations tend to lack integrated payment functionality within their business management systems and where we face less competition for our solutions. In many cases, we deliver our proprietary software solutions to strategic vertical markets through the payment facilitator model, where we: 
•enable superior data management by aggregating multiple small merchants under our “master” account, resulting in the collection and management of data not historically readily available;
•streamline and simplify merchant onboarding, often resulting in client approval in minutes or hours rather than days or weeks; and
•provide ease of reporting and reconciliation, allowing our clients to accept electronic payments in a faster, more convenient fashion.
As more ISVs seek to differentiate their offerings by seamlessly integrating payment functionality into their software solutions, the payment facilitator model has gained significant momentum. Before payment facilitators were an option, any business looking to accept credit cards was required to establish an individual merchant account, which is often costly and time-consuming for small merchants. 
We generate revenue primarily, but not exclusively, from volume-based fees generated by payment processing services provided to clients throughout the United States. Our payment processing services enable clients to accept electronic payments, facilitating the exchange of funds and transaction data between clients, financial institutions and payment networks. Services include merchant onboarding, risk and underwriting, authorization, settlement, chargeback processing and other merchant support services. We also generate revenue from software licensing subscriptions, ongoing support, and other POS-related solutions that we provide to our clients directly and through our distribution partners. Due to our integrated payment and software solutions and our distribution network, we are able to derive significant scale from operating efficiencies, which enable us to generate strong operating margins and profitability. 
Our Segments
We have two reportable segments, Merchant Services and Proprietary Software and Payments, and an Other category. For additional information on our segments, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Merchant Services
Our Merchant Services segment provides comprehensive payment solutions to businesses and organizations. Our Merchant Services segment includes third-party integrated payment solutions as well as traditional payment services across our strategic vertical markets. 
Proprietary Software and Payments
Our Proprietary Software and Payments segment delivers embedded payment solutions to our clients through company-owned software. Payments are delivered through both the payment facilitator model and the traditional merchant processing model. Our Proprietary Software and Payments clients are primarily in the education, public sector and property management markets. 
Other
Our Other category includes corporate overhead expenses, when presenting reportable segment information.
Our Products, Solutions and Technology
We deliver to our clients and distribution partners a comprehensive suite of integrated payment technology and software solutions to address the needs of SMBs and organizations in our strategic vertical markets. Our products and solutions are strategically aligned to support new client growth and promote customer retention.
We have developed a suite of payment technology solutions that: 
•integrate with a broad number of client business management systems;
•perform a broad range of risk management, transaction processing and value-added services beneficial to our clients;
•increase convenience to our clients;
•provide ease of use and greater functionality for our clients; 
•offer validated point-to-point encryption (“P2PE”); and
•offer PCI-compliant security and extensive reporting tools.
We offer our clients a single point of access through our powerful, simple and capable proprietary core platform (“Burton Platform”). Combining a centralized environment for scalability, PCI Service Level Provider (“SLP”) Level 1 security and redundancy, Burton Platform offers a broad suite of payment and software solutions, enabling omni-channel POS, spanning brick and mortar locations and electronic- and mobile-commerce, including app-based payments. We employ project management, release management and product development lifecycle methodologies that enable us to deploy initial downloads and upgrades in a quick and efficient manner via the cloud. 
Burton Platform is the core of our technology suite. A platform designed to be highly scalable, built for minimal downtime and high transaction volume, Burton Platform brings together common components of our vertical software technologies as well as several historically disparate solutions.
Burton Platform includes an Application Programming Interface (“API”) suite that provides access to traditional merchant processing, ACH processing and payment facilitator merchant processing capabilities. The platform APIs allow access to Europay, Mastercard and Visa (“EMV”) devices as well as validated P2PE certified devices using an implementation that shields software providers from the requirements of PCI / payment application data security standard (“PA-DSS”) certification.
We own multiple horizontal software solutions, including Burton Platform described above. In the business-to-business (“B2B”) market, we provide payment solutions to clients in industries that include professional services (including law firms), manufacturing, contractor services, construction, and other industries where a significant percentage of payments are received using a commercial, business, purchasing, or virtual card. Our B2B payment solutions offer clients secure processing technology to authorize and settle transactions at reasonable card rates, automate the pass-through of line item details, and enhance the automation of the accounts receivable process. Our distribution partners include card issuers and industry associations, each of whom provides a predictable source of new client leads. 
In addition, we provide payment processing solutions to many retail establishments using both an integrated and traditional merchant account approach. For example, we have reseller arrangements, pursuant to which we re-sell integrated POS solutions that consist of both hardware and software. We provide support services to these POS clients, most of which are in the restaurant and hospitality markets, and we also cross-sell our payment processing solutions to this client base.
Our solutions are positioned to support new client growth and promote client retention both within and outside our existing verticals, but most importantly to provide a stable and secure payment experience.
Our Sales and Marketing
Our sales strategy leverages a broad network of distribution partners, comprised of ISVs, value-added resellers (“VARs”), independent sales organizations (“ISOs”) and our referral partners which include financial institutions, trade associations, chambers of commerce and card issuers. These distribution partners are a consistent and scalable source for new client acquisition. Leveraging our vertically focused suite of products and services, we are able to maximize the performance and retention of current distribution partners while attracting new partners. These one-to-many distribution partners accelerate penetration within our vertical markets in a cost-effective manner. 
Our sales force includes both outside and inside representatives to manage each distribution partner relationship and deliver optimal response times to new client referrals. Our product and partner marketing is delivered through a shared-services model which is coordinated with each business unit. Marketing is tightly aligned with our sales efforts by providing event coordination, demand generation resources, physical and electronic marketing campaigns and partner marketing collateral. Our enterprise marketing function establishes our overall corporate marketing strategy to enhance brand awareness and demand generation. We use a broad variety of traditional and digital marketing mediums to engage prospective clients. 
Our direct sales team is responsible for selling our proprietary software and payment technology solutions to clients primarily through our distribution and referral partner networks. The assigned sales team is the primary liaison for managing the partner relationship, coordinating with marketing team efforts and engaging new client referral opportunities. We utilize our direct sales team to sell our proprietary software and payment technology solutions directly to clients in our education, property management and public sector markets.
Our Operations 
Our operations team is uniquely structured to optimize the experience of our clients and distribution partners. These regionally distributed and vertically focused business support teams allow us to establish a level of expertise that delivers a scalable support structure and enables us to align our services with the economic goals and specific expectations of the respective business unit. Each operations team is positioned to support the functions of their respective client base and key performance indicators mark their progress toward achieving the goals established by each business unit. Our client and partner databases provide visibility into each overall client relationship, tracking the status of the relationship from initial contact through the lifecycle of that client or partner relationship. Our centralized technology department is structured to rapidly enhance and effectively maintain our products and services.
Our operations team is structured to effectively support the individual needs of our clients and distribution partners. This support includes:
•client onboarding;
•client support and retention;
•client training and activations;
•billing and financial review; 
•credit underwriting and risk management;
•dispute and chargeback processing;
•distribution partner support; and
•customer support.
Our technical operations team oversees the execution of development, quality control, delivery and support for our payment processing applications and the hosted user applications. Applications are developed and tested according to the software development lifecycle, composed of iterative development and testing with a dedicated focus on planning and execution. Releases are modeled on continuous deployment and added to the live environment on a routine basis. Each application stack is built with redundancy to foster resiliency and built to be easily managed during a disaster recovery scenario. The entire solution is hosted within a managed, dedicated environment that is certified PCI-compliant to protect all personal and transactional data.
Our Competition 
We compete with a variety of merchant acquirers that have different business models, go-to-market strategies and technical capabilities. We believe the most significant competitive factors in our markets are: 
1.trust, including a strong reputation for quality service and trusted distribution partners; 
2.convenience, such as speed in approving applications, client onboarding and dispute resolution; 
3.service, including product functionality, value-added solutions and strong customer support; and 
4.economics, including fees charged to clients and residuals and incentives offered to distribution partners. 
Our competitors range from large and well established companies to smaller, earlier-stage businesses. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The payment processing industry is highly competitive. Such competition could adversely affect the fees we receive, and as a result, our margins, business, financial condition and results of operations” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Government Regulation 
We operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business and the products and services that we offer are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations and the rules and standards of the payment networks that we utilize to provide our electronic payment services, as more fully described below. 
Dodd-Frank Act
The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and the related rules and regulations have resulted in significant changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. Changes impacting the electronic payment industry include providing merchants with the ability to set minimum dollar amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and to offer discounts or incentives to entice consumers to pay with cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards, as the merchant prefers. New rules also contain certain prohibitions on payment network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions of debit card transactions. Additionally, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the interchange fees that certain issuers charge merchants for debit transactions will be regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transactions. Rules released by the Federal Reserve in July 2011 to implement the Durbin Amendment mandate a cap on debit transaction interchange fees for issuers with assets of $10 billion or greater. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which has assumed responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has the authority to determine whether any non-bank financial company, such as us, should be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System because it is systemically important to the U.S. financial system. Any new rules or regulations implemented by the CFPB or the Financial Stability Oversight Council or in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act that are applicable to us, or any changes that are adverse to us resulting from litigation brought by third parties challenging such rules and regulations, could increase our cost of doing business or limit permissible activities. 
Privacy and Information Security Regulations
We provide services that may be subject to privacy laws and regulations of a variety of jurisdictions. Relevant federal privacy laws include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which applies directly to a broad range of financial institutions and indirectly, or in some instances directly, to companies that provide services to financial institutions. These laws and regulations restrict the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These laws also impose requirements for safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. Our business may also be subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, which regulate the use and reporting of consumer credit information and also impose disclosure requirements on entities who take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies. In addition, there are state laws restricting the ability to collect and utilize certain types of personal information such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers and imposing secure disposal requirements for personal data. Certain state laws mandate businesses to implement reasonable data security measures. Massachusetts requires any business that processes the personal information of a Massachusetts resident to adopt and implement a written information security program. States are increasingly legislating data protection requirements for a broader list of personal data, such as biometric data, and are strengthening protections for students' personal information. All fifty states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have now enacted data breach notification laws requiring businesses that experience a security breach of their computer databases that contain personal information to notify affected individuals, consumer reporting agencies and governmental agencies that possess data. In June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which will come into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA will require companies that process personal information of California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, will grant consumers specific access rights to their data, will allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with or sales to third parties and will create a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA has broadly defined personal information to include any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to a consumer. Each privacy law and regulation that applies to us could increase our cost of doing business or limit permissible activities.
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Regulation 
Our business is subject to U.S. federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which we refer to collectively as the “BSA.” The BSA, among other things, requires money services businesses to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records. We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) that prohibit or restrict transactions to or from (or transactions dealing with) specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, such as those who might be narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Similar anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified on lists maintained by organizations similar to OFAC in several other countries and which may impose specific data retention obligations or prohibitions on intermediaries in the payment process. We have developed and continue to enhance compliance programs and policies to monitor and address related legal and regulatory requirements and developments. 
Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices
We and many of our clients are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices. In addition, laws prohibiting these activities and other laws, rules and or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Act, may directly impact the activities of certain of our clients, and in some cases may subject us, as the client’s payment processor or provider of certain services, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds if we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal or improper activities of the client through our services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the states attorneys general, have authority to take action against non-banks that engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices or violate other laws, rules and regulations and to the extent we are processing payments or providing services for a client that may be in violation of laws, rules and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business. 
In addition, the CFPB has recently attempted to extend certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prevent the employment of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) to payment processors. Though there is still litigation involving whether payment processing companies are subject to these requirements (and the extent of their application), these requirements may apply or be applicable in the future. UDAAPs could involve omissions or misrepresentations of important information to consumers or practices that take advantage of vulnerable consumers, such as elderly or low-income consumers.
Stored Value Services
Stored value cards, store gift cards and electronic gift certificates are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, which may include laws and regulations related to consumer and data protection, licensing, consumer disclosures, escheat, anti-money laundering, banking, trade practices and competition and wage and employment. The clients who utilize the gift card processing products and services that we may sell may be subject to these laws and regulations. In the future, if we seek to expand these stored value card products and services, or as a result of regulatory changes, we may be subject to additional regulation and may be required to obtain additional licenses and registrations which we may not be able to obtain. 
The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the “Card Act”) created new requirements applicable to general-use prepaid gift cards, store gift cards and electronic gift certificates. The Card Act, along with the Federal Reserve’s amended Regulation E, created new requirements with respect to these cards and electronic certificates. These include certain prohibited features and revised disclosure obligations. Prepaid services may also be subject to the rules and regulations of Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express and other payment networks with which our clients and the card issuers do business. The clients who utilize the gift card processing products and services that we may sell are responsible for compliance with all applicable rules and requirements relating to their gift product program. 
Additionally, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or “FinCEN”, issued a final rule in July 2011 regarding the applicability of the BSA’s regulations to “prepaid access” products and services. This rulemaking clarifies the anti-money laundering obligations for entities engaged in the provision and sale of prepaid services, such as prepaid gift cards. We are not registered with FinCEN based on our determination that our current products and services do not constitute a “prepaid program” as defined in the BSA and we are not a “provider” of prepaid access. We may in the future need to register with FinCEN as a “money services business-provider of prepaid access” in accordance with the rule based on changes to our products or services. 
Indirect Regulatory Requirements
Certain of our distribution partners are financial institutions that are directly subject to various regulations and compliance obligations issued by the CFPB, the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration and other agencies responsible for regulating financial institutions, which includes state financial institution regulators. While these regulatory requirements and compliance obligations do not apply directly to us, many of these requirements materially affect the services we provide to our clients and us overall. The financial institution regulators have imposed requirements on regulated financial institutions to manage their third-party service providers. Among other things, these requirements include performing appropriate due diligence when selecting third-party service providers; evaluating the risk management, information security, and information management systems of third-party service providers; imposing contractual protections in agreements with third-party service providers (such as performance measures, audit and remediation rights, indemnification, compliance requirements, confidentiality and information security obligations, insurance requirements, and limits on liability); and conducting ongoing monitoring, diligence and audits of the performance of third-party service providers. Accommodating these requirements applicable to our clients imposes additional costs and risks in connection with our financial institution relationships. We expect to expend significant resources on an ongoing basis in an effort to assist our clients in meeting their legal requirements. 
Payment Network Rules and Standards
Payment networks establish their own rules and standards that allocate liabilities and responsibilities among the payment networks and their participants. These rules and standards, including the PCI DSS, govern a variety of areas including how consumers and clients may use their cards, the security features of cards, security standards for processing, data security and allocation of liability for certain acts or omissions including liability in the event of a data breach. The payment networks may change these rules and standards from time to time as they may determine in their sole discretion and with or without advance notice to their participants. These changes may be made for any number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the regulatory environment, to maintain or attract new participants, or to serve the strategic initiatives of the networks and may impose additional costs and expenses on or be disadvantageous to certain participants. Participants are subject to audit by the payment networks to ensure compliance with applicable rules and standards. The networks may fine, penalize or suspend the registration of participants for certain acts or omissions or the failure of the participants to comply with applicable rules and standards. 
An example of a recent standard is the “chip and pin” or “chip and signature” card requirement, known as EMV, which was mandated by Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover to be supported by payment processors by April 2013 and by merchants by October 2015. This mandate set new requirements and technical standards, including requiring integrated point of sale systems to be capable of accepting the more secure “chip” cards that utilize the EMV standard and setting new rules for data handling and security. Processors and clients that do not comply with the mandate or do not use systems that are EMV compliant risk fines and liability for fraud-related losses. We have invested significant resources to ensure our systems’ compliance with the mandate, and to assist our clients in becoming compliant.
To provide our electronic payment services, we must be registered either indirectly or directly as a service provider with each of the payment networks that we utilize. Because we are not a bank, we are not eligible for primary membership in certain payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, and are therefore unable to directly access these networks. The operating regulations of certain payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, require us to be sponsored by a member bank as a service provider. We are registered with certain payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, through various sponsor banks. The agreements with our bank sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for clients and the terms of our agreements with clients. We are also subject to network operating rules and guidelines promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association (“NACHA”) relating to payment transactions we process using the ACH Network. Like the card networks, NACHA may update its operating rules and guidelines at any time and we will be subject to these changes. These operating rules and guidelines allocate responsibility and liabilities to the various participants in the payment network. Recently, NACHA has focused upon data security and privacy responsibilities. We are subject to audit by our partner financial institutions for compliance with the rules and guidelines. Our sponsor financial institutions have substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including the terms of our agreements with our ACH processing clients.
Money Transmitter Regulation
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations governing money transmission and the issuance and sale of payment instruments, including some of the prepaid products we may sell.
In the United States, most states license money transmitters and issuers of payment instruments. These states not only regulate and control money transmitters, but they also license entities engaged in the transmission of funds. Many states exercise authority over the operations of our services related to money transmission and payment instruments and, as part of this authority, subject us to periodic examinations. Many states require, among other things, that proceeds from money transmission activity and payment instrument sales be invested in high-quality marketable securities before the settlement of the transactions or otherwise restrict the use and safekeeping of such funds. Such licensing laws also may cover matters such as regulatory approval of consumer forms, consumer disclosures and the filing of periodic reports by the licensee and require the licensee to demonstrate and maintain specified levels of net worth. Many states also require money transmitters, issuers of payment instruments, and their agents to comply with federal and/or state anti-money laundering laws and regulations.
Other Regulation
We are subject to U.S. federal and state unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others we hold that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time such as account balances that are due to a distribution partner or client following discontinuation of its relationship with us. The Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 requires certain merchant acquiring entities and third-party settlement organizations to provide information returns for each calendar year with respect to payments made in settlement of electronic payment transactions and third-party payment network transactions occurring in that calendar year. Reportable transactions are also subject to backup withholding requirements. 
The foregoing is not an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations to which we are subject and the regulatory framework governing our business is changing continuously. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
Our Intellectual Property
Certain of our products and services are based on proprietary software and related payment systems solutions. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as employee and third-party non-disclosure, confidentiality, and contractual arrangements to establish, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights in our technology, including with respect to our proprietary rights related to our products and services. In addition, we license technology from third parties that is integrated into some of our solutions. 
We own a number of registered federal service marks, including i3 Verticals®, PaySchools® and Axia®. We also own a number of domain names, including www.i3verticals.com.
Our Employees
As of September 30, 2019, we had 542 employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our employee relations to be in good standing.
