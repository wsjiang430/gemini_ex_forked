Customers
We have a large number of customers in the various industries we serve. No commercial customer accounted for more than 10% of any segment net sales, during 2018, 2017 or 2016. No commercial customer in 2018, 2017 or 2016 accounted for more than 3.0% of total net sales.
Sales to international customers accounted for approximately 47% of total sales in 2018, compared with 46% in 2017 and 43% in 2016. In 2018, we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries. Approximately 90% of our sales to foreign-based customers were made to customers in 25 foreign countries. In 2018, the top five countries for international sales were China, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea and constituted approximately 21% of our total sales.
Approximately 23%, 24% and 27% of our total net sales for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. Information on our sales to the U.S. Government, including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor, is as follows (in millions):

U.S. Government sales by segment: | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Instrumentation | $ | 68.3 | | | $ | 65.2 | | $ | 74.4 
Digital Imaging | 90.5 | | | 85.6 | | | 73.1 
Aerospace and Defense Electronics | 252.5 | | | 225.0 | | | 210.4
Engineered Systems | 244.0 | | | 243.9 | | | 219.8
Total U.S. Government sales | $ | 655.3 | | | $ | 619.7 | | $ | 577.7

Our principal U.S. Government customer is the U.S. Department of Defense. These sales represented 17%, 18% and 21% of our total net sales for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, our largest program with the U.S. Government was the OSF program with the Missile Defense Agency (“Agency”), which represented 1.6% of our total net sales for 2018. The OSF follow-on program, which was not awarded to Teledyne in November 2018, has been put on hold pending an investigation by the Agency and, in the meantime, Teledyne’s performance under the OSF contract continues. In both 2017 and 2016, our largest program with the U.S. Government was the Mission Operations and Integration contract with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center which represented 1.5% of our total net sales in both years. 
As described under risk factors, there are risks associated with doing business with the U.S. Government. In 2018, approximately 67% of our U.S. Government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixed-price type contracts, compared to 58% in 2017 and 54% in 2016. Under these types of contracts, we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price. Such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance. Additionally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S. Government at its convenience, without identification of any default. When contracts are terminated for convenience, we recover costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. We had 15 U.S. Government contracts terminated for convenience in 2018, compared with nine in 2017 and one in 2016.
Our total backlog of confirmed and funded orders was approximately $1,568.8 million at December 30, 2018, compared with $1,250.2 million at December 31, 2017, and $916.4 million at January 1, 2017. We expect to fulfill a majority of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2019.

We believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete. Although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets, each of our markets is highly competitive. With regard to our defense businesses, it is common in the defense industry for work on programs to be shared among a number of companies, including competitors. In any event, because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, none of which we believe offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do. Our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality, product performance and reliability, technical expertise, price and service. Many of our competitors have, and potential competitors could have, greater name recognition, a larger installed base of products, more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial, technological and personnel resources than we do.

Intellectual Property
While we own and control various intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, and copyrights, which, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business, we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties. We own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents, technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others. Similarly, other companies are licensed to use certain patents, technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us.
Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents, patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Environment and Sustainability
Teledyne’s products contribute to understanding the environment and humankind’s impact to the health and sustainability of our planet. We provide environmental and climate scientists with a broad portfolio of instruments and sensors, including space-based sensors for greenhouse gases, air and water monitoring instruments and autonomous systems and instruments that profile the world’s oceans. Our precision visible and infrared sensors enable NASA’s s Orbital Carbon Observatories (in low Earth orbit) and GeoCarb (in geosynchronous orbit) satellite missions to make precise measurements of the sources and sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide over seasonal and weekly cycles. Our autonomous Slocum® gliders, APEX® drifting floats and our acoustic Doppler current profilers have been used by scientists to confirm warming trends and circulation conditions of the oceans. Our instruments not only enhance climate research that spans decades, but they provided critical data for shorter timescales. Our products measure seasonal variations in ocean temperatures and currents to aid fisheries and determine weather patterns. On a shorter timescale, scientists employ our instruments to provide essential inputs for computer models of dangerous storms. Scientists position our gliders directly in the path of developing storms to monitor real-time conditions via satellite links.
Additionally, Teledyne’s product portfolio includes sophisticated air and water quality monitoring instruments to help keep the air we breathe and the water we drink clean. We design, produce and distribute sophisticated air quality instruments that measure hazardous gases and particulate matter in real-time. Our new Teledyne API T640 instrument delivers exceptional sensitivity and precision in ambient particular monitoring. Our water sampler instruments enable environmental professionals to conveniently collect and safely store water for laboratory analysis and to precisely determine the flow rate of water in wastewater, irrigation and industrial applications.
We also have products designed to improve the efficiency of motors, motor drives and industrial automation systems to reduce energy consumption. Our line of motor drive analyzers measure performance dynamically. The high-resolution display and sensitive software tools enable engineers to look inside the motor and motor drive to optimize performance and energy efficiency.
Pursuant to the mandate in their respective charters, the audit committee of our board regularly reviews matters related to compliance with environmental laws and the health and safety of employees, and the nominating and governance committee of our board reviews and evaluates our policies and practices and monitors our efforts in areas of legal and social responsibility, diversity and sustainability.

Ten current members of management have entered into change of control severance agreements. The agreements have a three-year, automatically renewing term, except as noted below. The executive is entitled to severance benefits if (1) there is a change in control of the Company and (2) within three months before or 24 months after the change in control, either we terminate the executive’s employment for reasons other than cause or the executive terminates the employment for good reason. “Severance benefits” currently consist of:

• | A cash payment equal to three times in the case of Dr. Mehrabian or two times in the other cases the sum of (i) the executive’s highest annual base salary within the year preceding the change in control and (ii) the Annual Incentive Plan bonus target for the year in which the change in control occurs or the average actual bonus payout for the three years immediately preceding the change in control, whichever is higher.


• | A cash payment for the current AIP bonus cycle based on the fraction of the year worked times the AIP target objectives at 100%.


• | Payment in cash for unpaid performance share program awards, assuming applicable goals are met, at 120% of performance targets (100% of performance targets in some agreements).


• | Continued equivalent health and welfare (e.g., medical, dental, vision, life insurance and disability) benefits at our expense for a period of up to 36 months (including Dr. Mehrabian) (24 months in some agreements, including Mr. Pichelli) after termination (with the executive bearing any portion of the cost the executive bore prior to the change in control); provided, however, such benefits would be discontinued to the extent the executive receives similar benefits from a subsequent employer.


• | Removal of restrictions on restricted stock issued under our restricted stock award programs.


• | Full vesting under the Company’s pension plans (within legal parameters) such that the executive shall be entitled to receive the full accrued benefit under all such plans in effect as of the date of the change in control, without any actuarial reduction for early payment.


• | Up to $25,000 (including Dr. Mehrabian) ($15,000 in some agreements, including Mr. Pichelli) reimbursement for actual professional outplacement services.


• | Immediate vesting of all stock options, with options being exercisable for the full remainder of the term.


• | There is no “gross up payment” to hold the executive harmless against the impact, if any, of federal excise taxes imposed on executive as a result of “excess parachute” payments as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. The executive will receive the better of, on an after-tax basis, (a) the unreduced excess parachute payment with no tax gross up payment, or (b) a parachute payment reduced to a level below which an excise tax is imposed.


• | Certain payments are deferred for six months following a separation of service to assure compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

The Company has entered into individual Indemnification Agreements with directors and certain officers and executives of Teledyne, including those members of Executive Management listed above. The Indemnification Agreements provide the directors and executives who are parties to the agreements with a stand-alone contractual right to indemnification and expense advancement to the greatest extent allowable under Delaware law. The Indemnification Agreements also provide:

• | In a third-party proceeding, an indemnitee is entitled to indemnification if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, if in a criminal action or proceeding, if the indemnitee had no reason to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. In a third party proceeding, the indemnification obligation covers reasonable expenses, judgment fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnity.


• | In proceedings by or in the name of the Company (e.g., derivative suits), an indemnitee is entitled to indemnification if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. In derivative suits, the indemnification obligation covers reasonable expenses, but in proceedings where the Company is alleging harm caused by the indemnitee, the indemnitee would generally not be entitled to be indemnified for judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (otherwise the Company would effectively not recover any damages), unless a Delaware or other court determines otherwise despite the finding of liability.


• | The Company has an obligation to advance, on an unsecured and interest free basis, reasonable expenses incurred by the indemnitee within 30 days of the indemnitee’s request. The indemnitee does not need to meet any standard of conduct to be entitled to advancement of expenses and there is no determination requirement to be made by the Board in connection with the advancements of expenses. An indemnity must repay any amounts advanced if it ultimately determined that the indemnity is not entitled to indemnification.

13

Our indemnification obligations do not cover the following situations: (1) where indemnification payments have been made under director’s and officer’s insurance or other indemnification provisions; (2) where the claim is based on disgorgement of short-swing profits under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act; (3) where the claim is based on reimbursement by the indemnitee to the Company of a bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation if required under the Exchange Act (e.g., in connection with a restatement as a result of the Company’s noncompliance with the financial reporting requirements required by Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act); or (4) where the proceeding is initiated by the indemnitee (other than proceedings that are consented to by the Board or that the indemnitee initiates against the Company to enforce the Agreement).
Under the Indemnification Agreements, in the event of a change in control or we reduce or do not renew our director’s and officer’s insurance coverage, we are required to purchase (or cause the acquirer or successor to the Company to purchase or maintain) a six-year tail policy, subject to a 200% premium cap. The agreements continue until the later of (i) 10 years after the indemnitee ceases to serve as a director or officer, and (ii) one year following the final termination of any proceeding subject to the agreement.
