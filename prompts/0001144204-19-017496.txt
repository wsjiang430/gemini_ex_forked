ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
On January 5, 2018, we changed our name to XpresSpa Group, Inc. (“XpresSpa Group” or the “Company”) from FORM Holdings Corp. Our Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, which had previously been listed under the trading symbol “FH” on the Nasdaq Capital Market, has been listed under the trading symbol “XSPA” since January 8, 2018. Rebranding to XpresSpa Group aligned our corporate strategy to build a pure-play health and wellness services company, which we commenced following our acquisition of XpresSpa Holdings, LLC (“XpresSpa”) on December 23, 2016.
 
As a result of the transition to a pure-play health and wellness services company, we currently have one operating segment that is also our sole reporting unit, XpresSpa, a leading airport retailer of spa services. XpresSpa is a well-recognized airport spa brand with 56 locations, consisting of 51 domestic and 5 international locations as of December 31, 2018. XpresSpa offers travelers premium spa services, including massage, nail and skin care, as well as spa and travel products. During 2018 and 2017, XpresSpa generated $49,294,000 and $48,373,000 of revenue, respectively. In 2018, approximately 83% of XpresSpa’s total revenue was generated by services, primarily massage and nailcare, and 17% was generated by retail products, primarily travel accessories.
 
We own certain patent portfolios, which we look to monetize through sales and licensing agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we determined that our intellectual property operating segment will no longer be an area of focus for us and, as such, will no longer be reflected as a separate operating segment, as it is not expected to generate any material revenues or operating costs.
 
In October 2017, we completed the sale of FLI Charge, Inc. (“FLI Charge”) and in March 2018, we completed the sale of Group Mobile Int’l LLC (“Group Mobile”). These two entities previously comprised our technology operating segment. The results of operations for FLI Charge and Group Mobile are presented in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as consolidated net loss from discontinued operations. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities belonging to Group Mobile as of December 31, 2018, and FLI Charge and Group Mobile as of December 31, 2017, are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as assets held for disposal and liabilities held for disposal, respectively.
 
Our Strategy and Outlook
 
XpresSpa is a leading airport retailer of spa services and related products. It is a well-recognized and popular airport spa brand with an approximately 50% market share in the United States and nearly three times the number of domestic locations as its closest competitor. It provides approximately one million services per year. As of December 31, 2018, XpresSpa operated 56 total locations in 23 airports, including one off-airport spa at Westfield World Trade Center in New York City, in three countries including the United States, Netherlands and United Arab Emirates. XpresSpa also sells wellness and travel products through its internet site, www.xpresspa.com. Key services and products offered include:

· | massage services for the neck, back, feet and whole body;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | nail care, such as pedicures, manicures and polish changes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------

· | travel products, such as neck pillows, blankets and massage tools; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | new offerings, such as cryotherapy services, NormaTec compression services, and Dermalogica personal care services and retail products. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For over 15 years, increased security requirements have led travelers to spend more time at the airport. In addition, in anticipation of the long and often stressful security lines, travelers allow for more time to get through security and, as a result, often experience increased downtime prior to boarding. Consequently, travelers at large airport hubs have idle time in the terminal after passing through security.
 
XpresSpa was developed to address the stress and idle time spent at the airport, allowing travelers to spend this time productively, by relaxing and focusing on personal care and wellness. We believe that XpresSpa is well positioned to benefit from consumers’ growing interest in health and wellness and increasing demand for spa services and related wellness products.
 
Liquidity and Going Concern
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $3,403,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $2,247,000 of inventory and prepaid expenses and $109,000 of assets held for disposal, which amount to total current assets of $5,759,000. Our total current liabilities balance, which includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, debt, and the current portion of Convertible Notes (as defined below), was $16,658,000 as of December 31, 2018. The working capital deficiency of $10,899,000 as of December 31, 2018 includes $1,986,000 of convertible notes classified as short-term for which principal repayments may be made in shares of Common Stock at our election. In addition, included in total current liabilities is approximately $1,742,000 which relates to obligations that will not settle in cash, and an additional $465,000 of liabilities that are not expected to settle in the next twelve months.
 
While we have aggressively reduced operating and overhead expenses, and while we continue to focus on our overall profitability, we have continued to generate negative cash flows from operations and we expect to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. As discussed above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The receipt of this explanatory paragraph with respect to our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 will result in a breach of a covenant under the Senior Secured Note (as defined below) which, if unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date hereof, will constitute an event of default under the Senior Secured Note. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Secured Note, Rockmore may, among other things, declare the Senior Secured Note and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts owing under the Senior Secured Note to be due and payable. If the maturity date of the Senior Secured Note is accelerated as a result of the event of default referenced above, an event of default under the Convertible Notes would be triggered. If an event of default under the Convertible Notes occurs, the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes, liquidated damages and other amounts owing in respect thereof through the date of acceleration, shall become, at the holder’s election, immediately due and payable in cash.
 
We have taken actions to improve our overall cash position and access to liquidity by exploring valuable strategic partnerships, right-sizing our corporate structure, and stream-lining our operations. We expect that the actions taken in 2018 and early 2019 will enhance our liquidity and financial environment. In addition, we expect to generate additional liquidity through the monetization of certain investments and other assets. We expect that these actions will be executed in alignment with the anticipated timing of our liquidity needs. There can be no assurance, however, that any such opportunities will materialize.
 
Our historical operating results indicate that there is substantial doubt related to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. We believe it is probable that the actions discussed above will transpire and will successfully mitigate the substantial doubt raised by our historical operating results and will satisfy our liquidity needs 12 months from the issuance of the financial statements. However, we cannot reasonably predict with any certainty that the results of our planned actions will generate the expected liquidity required to satisfy our liquidity needs.
 
If we continue to experience operating losses, and we are not able to generate additional liquidity through the actions described above or through some combination of other actions, while not expected, we may not be able to access additional funds and we might need to secure additional sources of funds, which may or may not be available to us. Additionally, a failure to generate additional liquidity could negatively impact our access to inventory or services that are important to the operation of our business.
 
Recent Developments


CEO Transition
 
On February 8, 2019, Edward Jankowski resigned as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a director of the Company. Mr. Jankowski’s resignation was not as a result of any disagreement with the Company on any matters related to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. Mr. Jankowski will receive termination benefits including $375,000 payable in equal installments over a twelve-month term commencing on February 13, 2019 and COBRA continuation coverage paid in full by the Company for up to a maximum of twelve months.
 
Effective as of February 11, 2019, Douglas Satzman was appointed by our board of directors as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a director of the Company. 
 
Reverse Stock Split
 
On February 22, 2019, we filed a certificate of amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of our shares of Common Stock. Such amendment and ratio were previously approved by our stockholders and board of directors, respectively.
 
As a result of the reverse stock split, every twenty (20) shares of our pre-reverse split Common Stock were combined and reclassified into one (1) share of Common Stock. Proportionate voting rights and other rights of Common Stock holders were affected by the reverse stock split. Stockholders who would have otherwise held a fractional share of Common Stock received payment in cash in lieu of any such resulting fractional shares of Common Stock as the post-reverse split amounts of Common Stock were rounded down to the nearest full share. Such cash payment in lieu of a fractional share of Common Stock was calculated by multiplying such fractional interest in one share of Common Stock by the closing trading price of our Common Stock on February 22, 2019, and rounded to the nearest cent. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split.
 
Our Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on a post-reverse split basis at the open of business on February 25, 2019.

Competition
 
XpresSpa operated 56 locations, which includes 51 domestic locations and 5 international locations as of December 31, 2018. Our domestic units operate within many of the largest and most heavily trafficked airports in the United States. The balance of the North American market is highly fragmented and is represented largely by small, privately-owned entities that operate one or two locations in a single airport. Only two other market participants operate 10 or more airport locations in the United States. The largest domestic competitor operates 16 locations in nine airports in North America. Outside of North America, this same competitor operates 20 locations in eight international airports.
Our Market
 
Airport retailers differ significantly from traditional retailers. Unlike traditional retailers, airport retailers benefit from a steady and largely predictable flow of traffic from a constantly changing customer base. Airport retailers also benefit from “dwell time,” the period after travelers have passed through airport security and before they board an aircraft. For over 15 years, increased security requirements have led travelers to spend more time at the airport. In addition, in anticipation of the long and often stressful security lines, travelers allow for more time to get through security and, as a result, often experience increased downtime prior to boarding.
 
XpresSpa was developed to address the stress and idle time spent at the airport, allowing travelers to spend this time productively, by relaxing and focusing on personal care and wellness. We believe that XpresSpa is well positioned to benefit from consumers’ growing interest in health and wellness and increasing demand for spa services and related wellness products. According to the Global Wellness Institute, global wellness was a $4.2 trillion industry in 2018, which was an increase of 13.5% from $3.7 trillion in 2015. In addition, according to the Global Wellness Institute, the global spa industry represented $119 billion in 2018 and the fitness, mind and body industry represented $595 billion in 2018.
 
In addition, a confluence of microeconomic events has created favorable conditions for the expansion of retail concepts at airports, in particular, retail concepts that attract higher spending from air travelers. The competition for airplane landings has forced airports to lower landing fees, which in turn has necessitated augmenting their retail offerings to offset budget shortfalls. Infrastructure projects at airports across the country, again intended to make an airport more desirable to airlines, require funding from bond issuances that in turn rely upon, in part, the expected minimum rent guarantees and expected income from concessionaires.
 
Equally as important to the industry growth is XpresSpa’s flexible retail format. XpresSpa opens multiple locations annually, which have ranged in size from 200 square feet to 2,600 square feet, with a typical size of approximately 1,200 square feet. XpresSpa is able to adapt its operating model to almost any size location available in space constrained airports. This increased flexibility compared to other retail concepts allows XpresSpa to operate multiple stores within an airport, from which it enjoys synergies due to shared labor between stores.
 
XpresSpa believes that its operating metrics represent an attractive return on invested capital and, as a result, is pursuing new locations at airports and terminals around the country. Historically, XpresSpa has won approximately seventy percent of all requests for proposal (“RFP”) in which it has participated.
 
Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to a range of laws and regulations adopted by national, regional and local authorities from the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to, among others, licensing (e.g., massage, nail, and cosmetology), public health and safety and fire codes. Failure to obtain or retain required licenses and approvals, including those related to licensing, public health and safety and fire codes, would adversely affect our operations. Although we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, significant problems obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining such licenses, permits or approvals could delay or prevent the opening, or adversely impact the viability, of our operations.

Airport authorities in the United States frequently require that our airport concessions meet minimum Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise ("ACDBE") participation requirements. The Department of Transportation’s (“DOT”) ACDBE program is implemented by recipients of DOT Federal Financial Assistance, including airport agencies that receive federal funding. The ACDBE program is administered by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), state and local ACDBE certifying agencies and individual airports. The ACDBE program is designed to help ensure that small firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals can compete for airport contracting and concession opportunities in domestic passenger service airports. The ACDBE regulations require that airport recipients establish annual ACDBE participation goals, review the scope of anticipated large prime contracts throughout the year, and establish contract-specific ACDBE participation goals. We generally meet the contract specific goals through an agreement providing for co-ownership of the retail location with a disadvantaged business enterprise. Frequently, and within the guidelines issued by the FAA, we may lend money to ACDBEs in connection with concession agreements in order to help the ACDBE fund the capital investment required under a concession agreement. The rules and regulations governing the certification of ACDBE participation in airport concession agreements are complex, and ensuring ongoing compliance is costly and time consuming. Further, if we fail to comply with the minimum ACDBE participation requirements in our concession agreements, we may be held responsible for breach of contract, which could result in the termination of a concession agreement and monetary damages. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Business Operations – Failure to comply with minimum airport concession disadvantaged business enterprise participation goals and requirements could lead to lost business opportunities or the loss of existing business.”
 
We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various federal and state laws governing matters such as minimum wages, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements and other working conditions. We are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment, which may require us to design or modify our concession locations to make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons.
 
We are also subject to certain truth-in-advertising, general customs, consumer and data protection, product safety, workers’ health and safety and public health rules that govern retailers in general, as well as the merchandise sold within the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
 
Employees
 
As of March 15, 2019, we had 517 full-time and 186 part-time employees. XpresSpa had 32 full-time employees in San Francisco International Airport, who are represented by a labor union and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. XpresSpa had 20 full-time employees in Los Angeles International Airport, who are represented by a labor union and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
