Item 1. Business
Our Company
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 16, 2020 through a corporate conversion just prior to the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”). The Company was originally formed on February 28, 2012 as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Alabama as Innovative Med Concepts, LLC. On July 23, 2020, the Company changed its name from Innovative Med Concepts, LLC to Virios Therapeutics, LLC.
We are a development-stage biotechnology company focused on advancing novel antiviral therapies to treat diseases associated with a viral triggered abnormal immune response such as fibromyalgia (“FM”). Overactive immune response related to activation of tissue resident herpes virus has been postulated to be a potential root cause of chronic illnesses such as FM, irritable bowel disease (“IBS”), chronic fatigue syndrome and other functional somatic syndromes, all of which are characterized by a waxing and waning manifestation of disease. While not completely understood, there is general agreement in the medical community that activation of the herpes virus is triggered by some form of environmental and/or health stressor. Our lead candidate, IMC-1, is a novel, proprietary, fixed dose combination of famciclovir and celecoxib. IMC-1 represents a novel combination, dual mechanism antiviral therapy designed to synergistically suppress herpes virus activation and replication, with the end goal of reducing viral mediated disease burden.
IMC-1 combines two specific mechanisms of action purposely designed to inhibit herpes virus activation and replication, thereby keeping the herpes virus in a latent (dormant) state or “down-regulating” the virus from a lytic (active) state back to latency. The famciclovir component of IMC-1 inhibits viral DNA replication. The celecoxib component of IMC-1 inhibits cyclooxegenase-2 (“COX-2”) and to a lesser degree COX-1 enzymes, used by the herpes virus to amplify or accelerate its own replication. We are unaware of any other antivirals in development for the treatment of FM. We believe this novel approach was a germane consideration in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) designating IMC-1 for fast-track review status for the treatment of FM. Furthermore, IMC-1 has been granted a synergy patent based on the fact that neither antivirals nor NSAIDS/COX-2 inhibitors (the individual components of IMC-1) has proven effective in the management of FM when used as a monotherapy, yet the dual mechanism combination therapy generated a result in preliminary studies that appears to be greater than the sum of its parts.

IMC-1’s Novel, Synergistic Antiviral Mechanism Suppresses Viral Replication,
Demonstrates FM Treatment Effect
​
The potential of IMC-1 in FM was demonstrated by statistically significant improvement versus placebo in the primary endpoint of pain reduction in our double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2a proof-of-concept study in FM patients. This proof-of-concept study generated statistically significant clinical data on the effects of IMC-1 on both primary pain assessment and secondary measures of pain reduction, reduction in fatigue and improvement in the global health status in patients diagnosed with FM. A result is considered to be statistically significant when the probability of the result occurring by random chance, rather than from the efficacy of the treatment, is sufficiently low. The conventional method for measuring the statistical significance of a result is known as the “p-value,” which represents the probability that random chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value = 0.001 means that there is a 0.1% or less probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). Generally, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant and may be supportive of a finding of efficacy by regulatory authorities. However, regulatory authorities, including the FDA and EMA, do not rely on strict statistical significance thresholds as criteria for marketing approval and maintain the flexibility to evaluate the overall risks and benefits of a new treatment.
The table below demonstrates the significant differences observed in the proof-of-concept study between IMC-1 and placebo in change from baseline using both the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 24-hour recall pain data and the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R) with LOCF/BOCF imputation.

IMC-1 also exhibited consistent improvement across several secondary FM treatment outcomes, including 50% responder analysis, improved functional assessments, lower chronic fatigue, increased time to rescue medication and improvements in FM patient’s overall global health status. One key secondary measure assessing a 30% pain reduction analysis was approaching but did not meet statistical significance (p = 0.052). In the Phase 2a study, IMC-1 demonstrated a lower discontinuation rate due to adverse events as compared with placebo.
There were no deaths during the study and only three serious adverse events (“SAEs”) were reported. The two SAEs in the IMC-1 group were a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and a facial cellulitis and the one SAE in the placebo group was a right breast micro-metastatic ductal carcinoma. One of the 3 SAEs was considered possibly related to study treatment — the non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction that occurred early in the study in a 47-year- old patient treated with IMC-1. The causal relationship of this SAE to treatment with IMC-1 cannot be ruled out and as such was determined to be “possibly related” to IMC-1; however, the patient’s underlying coronary artery disease and strong family history of premature cardiac disease suggest that other causal factors might also have been involved.
Based on the significant unmet need in treating FM and the aforementioned Phase 2a FM data, IMC-1 has been granted FDA designation for fast-track review status. In addition, the novel mechanism of IMC-1 has enabled us to secure composition of matter intellectual property (patent) protection to 2033.
Following on from our successful Phase 2a study, we held an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. In the meeting, we agreed to initiate either a Phase 2b study or a Phase 3 program after we provide animal toxicology study data, to conduct a human PK study and a clinical trial protocol that includes monitoring renal function through standard safety labs to the FDA. A human PK study with the combined tablet of IMC-1 was completed and performed as expected, with no drug-drug interactions and no adverse events. Multiple dose PK of IMC-1 was well characterized and provides additional data to better understand the PK profile of IMC-1. As a result, we have progressed development of IMC-1 from Phase 2a proof-of-concept to a larger scale Phase 2b study, known as FORTRESS, (Fibromyalgia Outcome Research Trial Evaluating Synergistic Suppression of HSV-1), for the treatment of FM. The Phase 2b and chronic toxicology studies are planned components of the registration package supporting Phase 3 requirements.
In September 2022, we announced the top line results from our FORTRESS study in FM. Overall, the FORTRESS study did not achieve statistical significance on the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline to Week 14 in the weekly average of daily self-reported average pain severity scores comparing IMC-1 to placebo (p=0.302). However, analysis of the data showed a bifurcation of response based on the timing of patient enrollment in the FORTRESS study. During the first half of the trial from June 2021 to November 2021, for the patients who were enrolled (n=208) (Cohort 1) when the Delta variant of COVID-19 was the dominant strain in the U.S., full vaccination rates were below 50% and some form of quarantining was still in place in most geographies, IMC-1 demonstrated no improvement versus placebo-treated patients. Conversely, during the second half of the trial from November 2021 to April 2022, for the patients who were enrolled (n=214) (Cohort 2) when vaccination rates improved, the Omicron variant of COVID-19 became the dominant U.S. strain and quarantining restrictions were less, IMC-1-treated patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement on the primary pain reduction endpoint (p=0.03) at Week 14, as well as a statistically significant improvement in the key secondary PROMIS Fatigue assessment (p=0.006) and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQR) symptoms domain score (p=0.015). See the figure below. We believe the likelihood of such a differential response based on the timing of patient enrollment is highly unlikely due to chance or a random occurrence, thus further analysis of the data was warranted, particularly in the context of our previous IMC-1 Phase 2a study success.

Importantly, IMC-1 displayed a first in class safety profile with excellent tolerability and with only 4.6% of IMC-1 treated patients dropping out due to adverse events, as compared with 8.1% of placebo treated patients. No adverse event category in the IMC-1 group exceeded a 4% rate with the exception of COVID-19 infection. Overall discontinuations were 18.5% in the IMC-1 treated group versus 23% in the placebo treated group. Patients in the FORTRESS trial were randomized one-to-one to either IMC-1 or placebo and patient background demographics and baseline pain scores were well matched.
In addition to potential COVID pandemic related impacts, a number of factors differed between those patients recruited during the first half versus the second half of the FORTRESS study. For example, 70% of the patients enrolled in the first half of the study were “Prior” patients who had previous relationships with their respective FORTRESS research sites and/or were participants in prior FM clinical trials. In contrast, over 50% of the FORTRESS subjects enrolled later in the study were “New”, community based patients who had not participated in prior FM clinical trials. These New patients were generally recruited through social media advertising. Based on this demographic understanding, the team assessed how New patients versus Prior treated patients responded to IMC-1 treatment, in both cases versus placebo. Encouragingly, New patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement on the primary endpoint of reduction in FM related pain versus placebo, irrespective of when they enrolled in the study. In addition, New patients demonstrated statistical improvement in key secondary measures, including reduction in fatigue, improvement on the FIQR total scores and reductions in depression, the latter of which is believed to be important given depression is associated with the increased rate of suicide amongst FM patients. Conversely, Prior patients did not show improvement in FM related pain when compared with placebo. In addition to the difference in response between Prior and New patients, we also observed differences within these groups based on timing of recruitment. We believe that recruitment early in the FORTRESS study was much more strongly impacted by pandemic related issues, as opposed to those recruited in 2022. Factors such as staffing levels, training, rates of absenteeism, and supply related issues all improved at the site level as we moved into 2022. The figure below shows the statistically significant primary endpoint result when analyzing the New patient population.

Based on the analysis of the FORTRESS data, we believe focusing the forward development of IMC-1 on New FM patients represents a viable and manageable path forward. The Company is scheduled to meet with the FDA in March 2023 to discuss the most appropriate next steps in advancing IMC-1 development as a treatment for FM. If alignment can be reached, management will consider raising additional capital to fund future research and/or seek a partner to develop or co-develop IMC-1 as a treatment for FM.
For the Phase 3 program, we intend to run two qualifying pivotal trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of IMC-1 treating patients with FM. The first Phase 3 study is planned to be a four-arm, multifactorial design to demonstrate the relative safety and efficacy of IMC-1 as compared to celecoxib alone, famciclovir alone and placebo. The second Phase 3 study is planned to be a two-arm study comparing IMC-1 to placebo. All patients from the Phase 3 program will be offered the opportunity to enroll into an open label safety follow-on extension study in which all patients will be treated with IMC-1, which is the third key component of the Phase 3 program proposal.
Background of Fibromyalgia (FM)
FM is a widespread chronic pain disorder including severe symptoms of fatigue lasting 3 months or longer in duration. FM is also characterized by generalized aching, muscle stiffness, non-restorative sleep, chronic fatigue, depression, cognitive impairment and disturbances in bowel function. Researchers estimate that FM affects 2% to 8% of the US population and is the second most common “rheumatic disorder,” second to osteoarthritis. The National Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Association estimates that 10 million Americans have FM.
We estimate that there are approximately 3.6 million patients in the U.S. that have been diagnosed with FM, with approximately 2 million being treated. Because there are no specific clinical or laboratory tests available to diagnose FM, diagnosis is established by demonstrating that a patient has widespread chronic pain in 7 or more of the 19 bodily locations for at least 3 months in duration. Additionally, these patients may 

10



also have non-restorative sleep, life altering fatigue, and cognitive impairment. The underlying cause of FM has remained elusive and frustrated treating physicians and the scientific community alike. To date, the three products approved by the FDA for the treatment of FM have the potential to cause troublesome side effects and/or deliver limited efficacy.
The American College of Rheumatology (“ACR”) has provided working definitions for the diagnosis of FM. ACR published its 1990 criteria and 2010 criteria to assist physicians in making this diagnosis. The 1990 criteria require that patients have widespread chronic pain in all four quadrants of the body for at least 3 months duration and at least 11 out of 18 predefined tender point sites are painful. The 2010 criteria revision introduced the concepts of a widespread pain index (“WPI”) and symptom severity scale score (“SSS”) for at least 3 months and no other explanation for the chronic symptoms. In 2016, the ACR developed a revision of the 2010/2011 FM criteria. FM may now be diagnosed in adults when all of the following criteria are met:

● | WPI ≥ 7 and SSS score ≥ 5 OR WPI = 4-6 and SSS score ≥ 9;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Generalized pain, defined as pain in at least 4 of 5 regions, is present; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

A diagnosis of FM is valid irrespective of other diagnoses and does not exclude the presence of other clinically important illnesses.
Fibromyalgia: A Serious Condition with Unmet Medical Need
FM is associated with increased mortality due to suicide or accident. Researchers evaluating over 8,186 patients with FM across three different sites in the United States between 1974 and 2009 found that individuals with FM were more than three times as likely (odds ratio (“OR”) = 3.31) to die from suicide compared to the general population and were at increased risk of death due to accidents (OR = 1.45, 95% confidence interval (“CI”); 1.02-2.06). This led the authors to speculate that some of the deaths that were classified as accidents may actually have been suicides, suggesting an even higher rate of suicide among these patients. This increased risk of mortality associated with the diagnosis of FM suggests that FM is a serious disease and that treatment of FM represents a significant unmet medical need.
In 2018, the FDA conducted a Patient-Focused Drug Development (“PFDD”) meeting with over 400 individuals or caregivers of individuals who experience chronic pain. Based on input from that meeting, the FDA reported that despite patient use of FDA approved and off-label therapies, the majority of FM patients continue to experience worsening pain, fatigue, cognitive impairment and other symptoms over time that requires increasing utilization of significant healthcare resources. In a 2001 study of 100 cases of FM in Ontario, Canada, patients reported spending most of at least one day in bed over the previous two weeks because of their health, and they spent more total days in bed compared to pain control and general control groups. Such unresolved morbidity significantly impacts the day-to-day functioning of patients suffering from FM.
Under the fifth authorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, from 2013-2018, the FDA conducted 24 disease specific PFDD meetings to better understand patients’ perspectives on their condition and the available therapies to treat their conditions. On March 26, 2014, the FDA held a public meeting with patients suffering from FM. The meeting was chaired by 5 panelists from the FDA who interviewed 10 patients with FM who expressed FM to be a condition with an unmet medical need. Patients described the impact of FM on their daily lives, and their experiences with currently available therapies. During FDA’s meeting on the diagnosis, symptoms and treatment options for FM, the FDA acknowledged that: “There is a continuing need for treatments to better manage symptoms and treat the underlying condition.” Patients described prescription drugs as having widely varying degrees of effectiveness, with many participants noting limited benefits or decreased benefit over time. Additionally, even when treatment was effective, many FM patients described 

11



that they could not adhere to treatment regimens because they were unable to tolerate treatment side effects including, but not limited to, cognitive issues, mood disruptions, nausea, high blood pressure, and, in certain cases, severe withdrawal symptoms. The following complaints, summarized from patient comments from the PFDD meeting and public comments submitted to the meeting docket, demonstrate the significant limitations of the three drugs approved by FDA for the management of FM.
Lyrica (pregabalin) — FDA Approved June 2007

a. | Discontinuation of Lyrica after a few weeks due to negative side effects, most notably drowsiness, cognitive issues, dizziness, effects on mood, and weight gain. Other side effects noted included depression and swelling of the mouth and tongue.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | Loss of effectiveness over time.
---+---------------------------------


c. | Withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing Lyrica.
---+------------------------------------------------

Cymbalta (duloxetine) — FDA Approved June 2008

(1) | Negative side effects such as headache, vertigo, sleep issues, fatigue, mood disruptions, loss of libido, nausea, cognitive issues, weight gain, swelling of the mouth and tongue, vision problems and suicidal thoughts.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Severe withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing Cymbalta.
----+---------------------------------------------------------

Savella (milnacipran) — FDA Approved January 2009

a. | Discontinuation of Savella due to side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure, excessive sweating, and mood disruptions.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | Ineffective or intolerable side effects.
---+-----------------------------------------

Each of the three drugs approved by the FDA for the management of FM, Lyrica, Cymbalta and Savella, modify central pain processing; pregabalin via modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels, and duloxetine and milnacipran via serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition (“SNRI”). Current treatments, including FDA approved therapies, prescription drugs used off-label and other non-prescription treatments are generally ineffective in managing FM for most patients.
The table below shows the percentage use of different therapies for FM based on data from a 2012 study lead by Dr. Rebecca Robinson, a FM researcher, and her colleagues. The study evaluated the burden of illness and treatment patterns for patients with FM from July 2008 through May 2010 in 58 care settings in the United States, including Puerto Rico. A majority of the 91 physicians participating were either rheumatologists or primary care physicians. There were 1,700 patients with FM who were mostly female and white with a mean age of 50.4 years and duration of illness of 5.6 years. The study shows the burden of illness is high, patients were taking on average 2.6 medications concurrently to treat their FM and the treatments with the most evidence to support their use were not always the treatments most frequently chosen. Opioids were one of the most commonly used treatments, even though there is no evidence opioids are effective in treating FM 

12



related pain. The FDA issued a statement in February 2019 indicating the agency will be pushing for increased research and development of non-addictive, non-opioid chronic pain treatments.
​
The chart below comes from an observational study in 2013 led by Dr. Rebecca Robinson. Researchers assessed the 12-month treatment patterns and outcomes for patients starting a new medication for FM in actual clinical practice. Data from 1,700 patients was collected at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months using a regression model. Patients were started on 145 unique drugs and over 75% took two or more medications concurrently for FM at each time point assessed. The most common reason for discontinuation was adverse events (63.4%) followed by lack of efficacy (30.3%). This study shows that adverse events can have a detrimental impact on adhering to medications used chronically to treat FM.
​
The polypharmacy (both indicated and off-label medications) utilized by patients to manage their FM symptoms, along with a demonstrated lack of adherence to currently approved FDA treatments, reflect side 

13



effects and/or lack of efficacy of currently available drugs and treatments. It also indicates a very significant unmet medical need, with associated cost burden to payers and loss of productivity of patients. With the exception of IMC-1, we are not aware of any drugs currently in development and directed at the management of FM that deploy an antiviral mechanism(s) of action. Current products are used to ameliorate FM symptoms rather than address an underlying cause(s) of the disease. In contrast, the mechanism of action of IMC-1 targets a potential underlying, root cause of FM- herpes virus reactivation.
Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions. As a result, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. However, generally speaking, in clinical trials the discontinuation rate for the three central nervous system-mediated, FDA approved drugs, is approximately twice that of patients treated with placebo. This is important as inability to tolerate a medicine can lead to discontinuation of therapy.
Our Novel Mechanism of Action (“MOA”)
Scientists and clinicians agree that patients with FM have a problem with central pain processing. The exact causality of the heightened pain sensitivity in FM is poorly understood. What is generally agreed is that the central sensitization seen in FM is secondary to a combination of genetic and environmental factors that render the patient susceptible to developing the widespread chronic pain and related symptoms seen in FM. We believe that, when FM patients are exposed to significant life stressors, be they physical or emotional, it results in an abnormal stress or herpes virus mediated-immune response. Herpes viruses are unique in that they remain in a dormant state (latency) in neuronal nuclei as nonintegrated, circular DNA associated with nucleosomes, with recurrent reactivations for the life of the host. We believe it is likely that nerve resident viral herpetic reactivation is necessary for the nociceptive response seen in FM. This cyclical process of virus reactivation and lytic infection is postulated to perpetuate FM symptoms in these patients.
Our novel therapeutic is directed at interrupting the ongoing immune response by suppressing the herpes virus, which suppresses the abnormal stress response, thereby alleviating the central pain processing abnormality and other FM symptoms. Studies have shown that neither antivirals nor COX-2/NSAIDS taken alone result in a meaningful clinical benefit. However, when administered in combination, the synergistic response was unexpected and promising. This IMC-1 synergistic response resulted from a combination of famciclovir inhibiting viral DNA polymerase and celecoxib inhibiting upregulation of COX-2 (and to a lesser extent COX-1). There have been multiple published studies using NSAIDS/COX-2’s in the treatment of FM. According to a 2017 review published in the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, NSAIDs/COX-2’s alone were shown to be no more effective than placebo in treating pain associated with FM. Products included in the review were ibuprofen 2400mg daily, naproxen 1000mg daily, tenoxicam 20mg daily and COX-2 etoricoxib 90mg daily. Antiviral monotherapy treatment of FM was studied by Dr. Sally A. Kendall and her colleagues and published in 2004 in the Journal of Rheumatology. Dr. Kendall evaluated valacyclovir 1 gram three times a day vs placebo in 60 patients with FM. The results showed no difference in change of pain between valacyclovir and placebo.
Virally induced upregulation of COX enzymes is important for efficient viral replication. An article published by Dr. Lynn W. Enquist, a professor at Princeton University, and his colleagues in the Journal of Virology (2004), demonstrated that many herpes viruses significantly up-regulate COX-2 and to a lesser degree COX-1. In an article published by Yuehong Liu and colleagues in 2014 in The Scientific World Journal, they estimated 14-fold increase in COX-2, 1.8-fold increase in COX-1 during herpes virus infection.
Celecoxib inhibits COX-2 and to a lesser degree COX-1, both of which are critical to the replication and growth of live virions. In general, COX-2 inhibition is regarded as more important than COX-1 inhibition for the suppression of herpes virus reactivation. COX-2 activation is involved in the induction of herpetic recurrences, and COX-2 inhibition is accompanied not only by a reduction of viral shedding, but also a reduction of viral DNA in nerve ganglia.

The anti-herpes virus MOA of the nucleoside analogs (which include famciclovir) is well characterized, and this drug class has been used to treat viruses over decades. In its active state famciclovir is initially phosphorylated to a monophosphate form, after which it is converted to penciclovir triphosphate by cellular kinases within virus-infected cells. Penciclovir triphosphate, the active moiety, competitively inhibits viral DNA polymerase, reducing viral DNA synthesis and replication. The specificity of penciclovir for viral DNA polymerase is an important contributor to its benign safety profile. Famciclovir interrupts DNA polymerase and, in combination with celecoxib, results in synergistic viral suppression. If definitively demonstrated through pivotal clinical trials, the efficacy, safety and tolerability, along with the combined MOA, would, we believe, differentiate IMC-1 from current standard of care and near-term pipeline drugs, while providing new opportunities in the treatment of other chronic pain conditions within the Somatic Symptom Disorders.
Discovery and Development
The initial clinical evidence supporting the development of an antiviral plus COX-2/NSAID combination to address FM was first derived through clinical observation in patients with IBS. IBS patients treated with famciclovir, who were serendipitously also placed on celecoxib to treat their arthritis, showed significant improvement not only in their IBS, but also FM, fatigue, and headaches. In particular, FM patients conveyed that they felt noticeably better when placed on the combination of famciclovir and celecoxib. We believe that stress and other environmental factors reactivate a persistent (indolent) herpes infection, resulting in a continuous nociceptive stimulation and immune response. The cyclical process of virus reactivation and lytic infection of herpes virus perpetuates FM symptoms. To interrupt and reverse viral reactivation and immune response, and resultant continuous nociceptive stimulation requires the suppression of the herpes virus, reverting it into a dormant (latency) status. We believe the coaction (synergy) of therapeutic agents with different antiviral properties is required to suppress herpes virus and reverse the symptoms of FM. Famciclovir, a nucleoside analog DNA inhibitor, inhibits the replication of viral DNA. The herpes virus upregulates COX-2, and to a lesser degree COX-1, and this upregulation of COX enzymes is critical for efficient viral replication. Celecoxib effectively blocks virally induced upregulation of COX enzymes, hence the combined activity of Famciclovir and Celecoxib results in the reversion of the herpes virus to latency.
IMC-1 interrupts the chronic dysfunctional immune response to the herpes virus infection by suppressing viral replication and re-emergence from latency. This results in the suppression of the abnormal stress response seen in IBS and FM, thereby alleviating the central pain processing abnormality. Multiple published clinical studies have confirmed that neither antivirals (such as famciclovir) nor COX-2/NSAIDs (such as celecoxib) administered singly deliver any meaningful clinical benefit. Based on Phase 2a study results, the synergy of the fixed-dose combination of famciclovir and celecoxib (IMC-1) has potential as a FM therapy. If approved, this could differentiate IMC-1 from current standard of care and pipeline products and, we believe, alter treatment outcomes in FM, and potentially a number of other chronic pain conditions in the Somatic Symptom Disorders where herpes viruses may play a role.

Biomarker — Gastrointestinal Tissue Study to see if Herpes Simplex Type 1 (“HSV-1”) is present in IBS/FM
​
The stomach of FM patients is one of the few sites that presents an opportunity for biopsy of tissue to determine if FM patients are burdened with herpes virus infection, where active FM is resultant upon reactivation of herpes virus infection. We have postulated that herpes virus infected nerve tissue located in the gastric mucosa provides a site for biopsy and represents an excellent site to confirm active herpes virus infection in patients with recurrent active FM. To test this hypothesis, we engaged the University of Alabama to analyze GI biopsy tissue to search for active HSV-1 virus. Thirty patients with documented FM with chronic GI complaints had their stomach biopsied with samples sent to the University of Alabama for analysis by Carol Duffy PhD, University of Alabama virologist. Fifteen controls without chronic pain or FM and without chronic GI conditions were studied as the comparator arm to the open study. The GI biopsies were evaluated for HSV-1 infection by Immunoblot analysis for viral non-structural protein (ICP8) with PCR used to detect herpesvirus DNA sequence. ICP8 is only found during an active HSV-1 infection. A summary of this data is presented below.
​
The study found that 83% of patients with FM and chronic GI conditions had ICP8, a protein only found in active HSV-1 infections as demonstrated in the GI biopsy. While only 9% of control patients had ICP8 (p = 0.0001). The study also analyzed patients suffering from symptoms of IBS and demonstrates a strong correlation with HSV-1 (p = 0.0005) as well, when compared to controls. The correlation of HSV-1 activation to FM (and IBS) was shown and we believe corroborates the underlying mechanistic rationale for IMC-1. The study is not required to be submitted to the IND.

PRID-201 Phase 2a Study of IMC-1 In Patients with Fibromyalgia (NCT01850420)
PRID-201 Phase 2a Study Design
The PRID-201 study represents the first placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of IMC-1. The Phase 2a clinical study involved 143 FM patients and a 16 -week, multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2a proof of concept trial conducted under IND 114827. Randomized patients received either IMC-1 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMC-1, as a single treatment for patients with primary FM. The primary efficacy outcome measure was a change from baseline in FM pain. FM pain was assessed using the 24-hour recall average pain score as recorded on the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (“NRS”) measure during clinic visits, as well as with the 7-day recall average pain score recorded on the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (“FIQ-R”). The safety and tolerability of treatment with IMC-1 was compared to placebo by analysis of vital signs, laboratory parameters, treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”), and discontinuation due to adverse events. A complete description of the study, including secondary and exploratory objectives, and results can be found in the PRID-201 Clinical Study Report submitted to the Investigational New Drug (“IND”) on December 11, 2014 (Serial No. 0009).
Patients completed the NRS for pain, revised FIQ-R, Beck Depression Inventory (“BDI-II”), Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (“MFI”), and the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (“PROMIS”) fatigue questionnaire at Baseline and Weeks 6, 12, and 16 (or early termination (“ET”)). Patients also completed a Patient Global Impression of Change (“PGIC”) questionnaire at Weeks 6, 12, and 16 (or ET).
IMC-1 demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the chronic pain of the studied FM patients when measured by either metrics utilized in the study: the 24-hour recall data, or the 7-day pain recall. Additionally, in this proof-of-concept study, IMC-1 treated subjects reported significant improvements on overall global impression of change at the 12 and 16-week visits. Significant improvement in fatigue (PROMIS fatigue scale) and mood (BDI-II scale) were noted at endpoint.
The primary outcome measure was based on change in patient-reported pain scores from baseline to week 16 of the study. IMC-1 treated subjects reported statistically significant better scores compared to placebo subjects, as summarized below. The two pain scales are very similar. The NRS scale measures pain over the last 24 hours on an 11-point numerical rating scale (from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst imaginable pain) that was recorded during clinic visits. The FIQ-R is a disease specific instrument designed to assess the impact of FM on various aspects of the patient’s well-being. The symptom section of the FIQ-R asks the patient to rate their level of pain over the past 7 days using an 11-point numerical scale (from 0 = No Pain to 10 = Unbearable Pain).

If the estimated change from baseline for a patient’s pain scores met or exceeded 50%, they were considered a 50% pain responder. In the pain responder analysis, a generalized linear regression curve fit was applied to an individual patient’s pain data. The high hurdle of 50% pain reduction from baseline is statistically significant at endpoint, pain outcome measures by 50% responder analysis are summarized below.

As shown in the chart below, the same analysis was performed for a 30% reduction in pain, and the results were statistically significant for the responders with 7-day recall but were not statistically significant for the 24-hour NRS.

​
Past studies of FM treatment have indicated that the Patient Global Interpretation Change (PGIC) scale is a sensitive measure for detecting therapeutic benefit. While it tends to correlate most closely with pain results, the PGIC can be viewed as a patient’s assessment of overall therapeutic benefit of the therapy in question. The PGIC outcome measure was pre-specified as a key secondary endpoint. The PGIC responder analysis (see below) was significant at the 6, 12, and 16-week visits.

​
FIQ-R total score change was significant as was the PROMIS Fatigue inventory, both of which evidence that IMC-1 does more than just modify the perception of pain. The FIQ-R total score is a composite of all questions from all three domains (Functional, Overall Impact and Symptoms). Fatigue was assessed in both the PROMIS fatigue score and the MFI total score. In the statistical analyses, the reductions from Baseline to Week 16 were numerically greater in the IMC-1 group than in the placebo group and reached statistical significance for the reduction in fatigue score in the PROMIS assessment (LS mean change of -2.68 vs. -6.65, p=0.001) but not in the MFI total score assessment (LS mean change -3.69 vs. -6.90, p=0.107).

Use of Rescue Medication
Tramadol use was prospectively identified as the only rescue therapy to be used in this study. The proportion of patients taking tramadol for FM rescue was defined as all tramadol usage from the concomitant medication logs. The proportion of patients who took rescue therapy for FM was summarized by treatment group. The use of tramadol was significantly higher in the placebo group compared to the IMC-1 group.

19



IMC-1 exhibited consistent improvement across several secondary FM treatment outcomes, including functional assessments, lower fatigue, increased time to rescue medication and improvements in FM patient’s global health status, as reflected in the table below.
​
PRID-201 Phase 2a Safety
Tolerability of IMC-1 was better than placebo in Study PRID-201 (P2a). As shown below, many of the treatment-emergent adverse event categories, including gastrointestinal, were reported more frequently in the placebo group and are actually symptoms of FM. No serious unexpected adverse events were noted in this study. There were no deaths during the study and only three serious adverse events (“SAEs”) were reported. The two SAEs in the IMC-1 group were a Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction and a Facial Cellulitis and the one placebo group SAE was a right breast micro-metastatic ductal carcinoma. One of the three SAEs was considered possibly related to study treatment — the non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction that occurred early in the study in a 47-year-old patient treated with IMC-1. The causal relationship of this SAE to treatment with IMC-1 cannot be ruled out; however, the patient’s underlying coronary artery disease and strong family history of premature cardiac disease suggest that other causal factors were also involved.

​
In PRID-201 Phase 2a, as seen in the chart below, more patients in the placebo group (16.2%; n=12) discontinued therapy due to adverse events than on IMC-1 (5.8%; n=4). Increased treatment adherence in actual clinical practice is important in any chronic therapy.
​
The lack of adherence to currently available treatments is indicative of the significant need for more effective and better tolerated therapies. Patients and physicians suggest that an ideal treatment would have fewer side effects and address the pervasive symptoms of FM including chronic fatigue; chronic fatigue was one of the three key factors of an ideal FM product that was discussed at the FM PFDD meeting. The preliminary clinical evidence reported suggests the potential for IMC-1 to address an unmet medical need by first treating an underlying cause, and thereby the symptoms of FM. IMC-1 also has the potential to improve safety and tolerability through more manageable rates of adverse reactions and consequently improving efficacy through improved adherence by FM patients.
IMC-1 Phase 2a End of Study Blinded Questionnaire
An end of study questionnaire analysis was included as an exploratory instrument in this Phase 2a study. It simply asked the patients whether they had suffered any conditions listed below which are commonly associated with FM, and if so, how their symptoms were now relative to baseline. The likelihood of improvement versus placebo was measured for patients on IMC-1 in the blinded “End of PRID-201 Phase 2a Trial” Questionnaire; data listed below:

● | FM and Chronic Fatigue: 2.2 times (improvement vs placebo)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | IBS: 2.8 times
--+---------------


● | Brain Fog (cognitive impairment): 2.1 times
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Headache: 2.5 times
--+--------------------

● | Temporomandibular joint: 5 times

● | Insomnia: 1.7 times
--+--------------------


● | Neck and back pain: 2.3 times
--+------------------------------


● | Anxiety: 2.8 times
--+-------------------


● | Depression: 1.6 times
--+----------------------

​
This information was gathered as exploratory data to inform future research. For example, patients who were on IMC-1 and had IBS symptoms were 2.8 times more likely to be improved compared to placebo. IBS is one of the indications we may explore for future IMC-1 clinical trials.
PRID-202 Phase 2b FORTRESS Study of IMC-1 In Patients with Fibromyalgia (NCT04748705)
PRID-202 Phase 2b FORTRESS Study Design
In May 2021, we began screening patients in our Phase 2b study known as the FORTRESS study (an abbreviation that stands for Fibromyalgia Outcome Research Trial Evaluating Synergistic Suppression of Herpes Virus) and in June 2021, we announced the dosing of our first patient in the FORTRESS study. The study participants were randomized to receive either IMC-1 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. FORTRESS was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, trial of IMC-1 for the treatment of FM. A total of 425 female FM patients ages 18 to 65 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with either IMC-1 or placebo at 42 U.S. sites. The primary endpoint for our FORTRESS study was reduction in pain over time. Patients were dosed with IMC-1 (675 mg famciclovir and 180 mg celecoxib) or matching placebo on a BID basis for 14 weeks. At the Week 14 primary endpoint visit, all patients were switched to placebo on a blinded basis. Previous experience with chronic pain trials has indicated that efficacy outcome measures recorded at the final study visit may be confounded by psychological factors relating to patients exiting a study. Therefore, it was critical that the patient was unaware of this potential change in her assigned study drug during the Week 14 and Week 16 interval. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMC-1, as a single treatment for patients with primary FM. The primary efficacy outcome measure was pain reduction. The patient’s self-reported 24-hour recall pain intensity score was evaluated on the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (“NRS”) measure collected daily on an e-diary. Weekly mean scores were calculated from averaging the available daily scores recorded for that week. The safety and tolerability of treatment with IMC-1 was compared to placebo by analysis of vital signs, laboratory parameters, treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”), and discontinuation due to adverse events. A complete description of the study, including secondary and exploratory objectives, and results can be found in the PRID-202 Clinical Study Report that will be submitted to the Investigational New Drug (“IND”) in Q2 of 2023.
Pain reduction was measured daily on the NRS 24-hour recall scale via an electronic diary that the patient used at home. In addition to assessing the FM patient’s pain reduction, we also assessed IMC-1’s ability to improve symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, overall global health status and patient function. In parallel to the FORTRESS study, our chronic toxicology studies in two species were completed. These studies are required by regulatory authorities to support chronic administration of IMC-1 in future clinical development.
Patients completed the NRS for pain daily on an electronic diary, the revised FIQ-R, the Beck Depression Inventory (“BDI-II”), the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (“PROMIS”) fatigue and sleep questionnaires and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (“HADS”) at Baseline and Weeks 6, 12, 14 and 16 (or early termination (“ET”)) during clinic visits. Patients completed a Patient Global Impression of Change (“PGIC”) questionnaire at Weeks 6, 12, 14 and 16 (or ET) during clinic visits.

22



PRID-202 Phase 2b FORTRESS Study Results
In this study, IMC-1 had a greater reduction in FM related pain at each study visit but did not achieve statistically significant improvements compared to placebo at the Week 14 primary endpoint. The graph below shows the primary endpoint result, p=0.30:

However, an anomalous bifurcation of results was noted when comparing the patients enrolled during the first half of the study (“Cohort 1”) with results from patients enrolled during the second half of the study (“Cohort 2”). More specifically, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment with IMC-1 versus placebo for Cohort 1 patients on any of the outcome measures of interest. Conversely, there were statistically significant differences in multiple outcomes of interest including the primary endpoint of reduction in pain at Week 14 as compared to placebo, p=0.030. The graph below compares Cohort 1 to Cohort 2 on the primary endpoint:


23



 Other outcomes that were statistically significant in Cohort 2 included fatigue (p=0.006), PGIC mean score change (p=0.027), FIQ-R symptoms (p=0.015), and FIQ-R total score change (p=0.019). It is highly unlikely that the differences between the first half and second half study results could be a random finding.
In addition to the Cohort 1 vs Cohort 2 finding, there was a subpopulation recruited through social media advertising (who were consequently new to the staff at the treatment sites and who were not prior FM trial participants), who also showed statistically significant results on both the primary endpoint and multiple secondary endpoints, independent of Cohort timing. The Table below summarizes the clinical results for the 175 patients included in this advertising subpopulation:

Advertising Population Outcomes Analysis | P Value | Effect Size
PGIC mean score change | 0.005 | 0.43 
PROMIS fatigue | 0.001 | 0.49 
FIQ-R symptoms domain | 0.006 | 0.42 
FIQ-R total score | 0.005 | 0.43 
Pain interference | 0.031 | 0.33

HADS depression | 0.002 | 0.48 
HADS anxiety | 0.011 | 0.39 
BDI-II | 0.010 | 0.39 

​
While the overall efficacy results from FORTRESS did not achieve statistical significance, the safety results were consistent with the excellent results previously seen in the Phase 2a study. As was seen previously, dropout rates on drug were less than placebo, and all adverse event categories other than COVID-19 infection were less than 5%. The Table below compares adverse event rates between IMC-1 and placebo:

​Adverse Event | PlaceboN=208 | IMC-1N=216
COVID-19 infection | 17 (8.2%) | 20 (9.3%) 
Headache | 12 (5.8%) | 8 (3.7%)

Fatigue | 1 (0.5%) | 3 (1.4%) 
Alanine aminotransferase increased | 0 (0.0%) | 3 (1.4%) 

​

Based on the analysis of the FORTRESS data, we believe focusing the forward development of IMC-1 on New FM patients represents a viable and manageable path forward. We are scheduled to meet with the FDA in March 2023 to discuss the most appropriate next steps in advancing IMC-1 development as a treatment for FM. If alignment can be reached, management will consider raising additional capital to fund future research and/or seek a partner to develop or co-develop IMC-1 as a treatment for FM.

Regulatory and Development Timeline
We have regularly engaged the FDA on IMC-1 for the treatment of FM. The FDA has provided the following guidance with respect to the development of IMC-1 for the treatment of FM. Since we are combining proprietary doses of two previously approved drugs, our fixed dose combination product candidate is eligible for submission to the FDA for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by, or for, the applicant and on which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The 505(b)(2) application enables us to reference published literature and/or the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for previously approved drugs with the same active ingredient. Under Section 505(b)(2), we plan to rely upon FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness, and extensively reference several sections of the US Prescribing Information for Famvir (famciclovir), from Novartis, and Celebrex (celecoxib), from Pfizer, the reference drugs for our program. The 505(b)(2) NDA filing will rely on portions of the development programs conducted by the sponsors of the reference drugs, as described in the FDA-approved US Prescribing Information. The FDA has agreed to our (b)(2) filing plan.
At the conclusion of our Phase 2a clinical study in 2017 we held an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA and conducted a subsequent conference call with the FDA in November 2017. As a result of those meetings the FDA has provided us with a defined path forward to Phase 3, including agreement to initiate a Phase 2b study and/or Phase 3 trial after we provide animal toxicology study data, conduct a human PK study with celecoxib and famciclovir combined in one tablet (which has been completed) and submit the Phase 2b clinical trial protocol that includes monitoring renal function through standard safety labs to the FDA.
The human PK study on the new tablet, using a three-way crossover study design, has been successfully completed. IMC-1 performed as expected in the human PK study, with no drug-drug interactions and no reported adverse events. Multiple dose PK of IMC-1 has been well characterized and provides additional data to better understand the PK profile of IMC-1.
We have also successfully completed the required 90-day sub-chronic toxicology studies with the oral combination of IMC-1 that we believe support the optimal dosing used in our FORTRESS study and to be used in our Phase 3 trials. This GLP 13-week general toxicology study with toxicokinetics and a recovery period has been completed, as has a 13-week GLP study of embryo-fetal development in rats, including using higher famciclovir doses. There were no unexpected toxicities from IMC-1 (all toxicities shown were consistent with the known toxicities of the individual reference drugs – celecoxib and famciclovir). Based on its review of prior 90-day and chronic toxicology studies, the FDA is requesting that we assess long term testicular and kidney toxicity in our chronic toxicology studies.
In order to support chronic long-term dosing with IMC-1, we conducted the required chronic toxicology studies in parallel to the FORTRESS study. These studies consisted of a six-month rat and a nine-month dog study. Consistent with earlier studies, there were no unexpected toxicities from IMC-1. All toxicities shown were consistent with known toxicities in celecoxib and famciclovir. 
The development of the IMC-1 tablet formulation and manufacture was completed at Frontida (Aurora, IL) along with the ongoing stability data (18-month stability data completed). The IMC-1 prototype tablet, completed at Catalent, had excellent 24-month stability.
In September 2022, we announced the top line results from our FORTRESS Phase 2b FM study. Analysis of the study data revealed:

● | New FM patients treated with IMC-1, who were recruited into our FORTRESS study through social media advertising, demonstrated statistically significant reductions in FM related pain, fatigue, anxiety and depressive symptoms and showed an overall improvement in their global health status.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Prior FM patients, who had previously enrolled in FM studies and/or who had a prior relationship with the FORTRESS study sites, did not exhibit meaningful treatment benefits.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New patients treated with IMC-1 also exhibited a lower discontinuation rate due to adverse events as compared with New patients receiving placebo.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All patients treated with IMC-1 demonstrated exemplary safety and tolerability in the FORTRESS study.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe the safety and efficacy results from the FORTRESS study support progression of IMC-1 to Phase 3 development for New patients, who represent the vast majority of the FM patient community.
We are scheduled to meet with the FDA in March 2023 to discuss advancing IMC-1 into Phase 3 development as a treatment for FM. At this meeting, we will discuss plans for a Phase 3 program that would support submission of a NDA for IMC-1 for the treatment of FM.

Market and Competition
The three pharmaceutical agents currently approved for the treatment of FM, pregabalin (Lyrica), duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella), are all associated with significant adverse events and limited clinical efficacy. Despite this, Lyrica and Cymbalta together had peak sales of approximately $10 billion across all of their approved indications, with Lyrica achieving sales of $3.6 billion in the United States in 2018, including sales related to FM. Reflecting the need for more effective and better tolerated treatments, a large number of additional products are also prescribed that are not indicated for FM. The American Academy of Rheumatology and FDA strongly recommends avoiding opioid narcotic medications for treating FM. Evidence shows these drugs are not helpful to most people with FM and will cause greater pain sensitivity or make pain persist. Despite that, research shows that FM patients are prescribed opioids as part of their treatment regimen.
According to the National Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Association, approximately 10 million Americans and 3% – 6% of people worldwide are afflicted with FM. Common chronic pain conditions affect approximately 116 million adults in the United States at a cost of $560 – $635 billion annually in direct medical treatment costs and lost productivity. This estimate combines the incremental cost of health care ($261-$300 billion) and the cost of lost productivity ($299 – $335 billion), more than heart disease or cancer. Competitive late-stage FM pipeline products are not disruptive to the current standard of care, nor do they appear to address the root cause of the disease.
We conducted a commercial opportunity assessment in each of 2014 and 2020 to better understand the medical needs existing in the FM treatment market and to quantify the addressable market opportunity for a potential new FDA approved FM treatment.
Our 2014 assessment reviewed the competitive landscape for the treatment of FM, including physician demographic information, patient demographic information, current & potential future treatment projections, and obtained information from high prescribing physicians and primary research with six healthcare payors as well as conducted a revenue forecast.
Our 2020 assessment provided an updated disease review, forecast and valuation for FM and IBS for the U.S. and Ex-U.S. markets. Both assessments show that significant unmet medical needs exist in the FM treatment armamentarium, as well as the IBS treatment armamentarium, highlighting the commercial potential for a new medicine that proves to be safe and effective as determined by the FDA.

26



Primary Research Background
In our 2014 assessment 75 physicians were surveyed, targeting high volume prescribers in key geographies and practice settings (rheumatologists, pain specialists, neurologists, primary care) across the United States. Also, eight high prescribing key opinion leader physicians (“KOLs”) were interviewed to gain qualitative insights into the treatment paradigm for FM and related disorders. Additionally, six payors were interviewed to determine their receptivity to IMC-1 as a first line treatment, how price sensitive these payors would be, how likely they would be to reimburse IMC-1, and whether Medicare would cover IMC-1.
This primary research confirmed the large unmet medical need in the treatment of FM. The researchers found that physicians and patients, express a need for additional, safer and more efficacious FM therapy options. The 2014 assessment found that only 15% of the 75 physicians surveyed expressed satisfaction with their current FM treatment options and none responded as being “very satisfied”. Ninety five percent of physicians surveyed indicated the available standard of care treatments only manage symptoms and did not treat the cause of the disease.
Physician Satisfaction with Available FM Therapies (n=75)
​
Physicians paralleled the concerns described by the patients at FDA’s PFDD meeting indicating that the currently FDA approved therapies have many of the associated adverse events such as dizziness, nausea or vomiting, weight gain, dry mouth, sleeplessness, restlessness, peripheral edema, chronic headaches, IBS symptoms and suicidal thoughts or actions. 
The six payors interviewed confirmed FM to be a serious disease with patients routinely consuming substantial healthcare resources. IMC-1, with proprietary dosing (dosing cannot be replicated by generic products) and a unique antiviral MOA with Fast Track status, can be expected to receive favorable pricing and formulary coverage and a high level of unmet need exists because the underlying cause is not well understood and treatment is patchwork.
Secondary Research: FM Pipeline
Both of our 2014 and 2020 assessments analyzed historical markets for FM and related disorders and identified key players and trends. They also created competitive intelligence on all in-line and pipeline FM treatments, including ongoing U.S. clinical trials. It is worth noting that the mechanistic approach for all of these potential new treatment candidates is complementary to the antiviral IMC-1 mechanistic approach, thus not true competitors to IMC-1, presuming continued success.

Other Market Opportunities
Each of the 2014 and 2020 assessment confirmed that FM represents an unmet medical need with a large market opportunity and that IMC-1 is a differentiated product. Overall, the assessment found that physicians are not satisfied with current FM treatments, that the etiology and cause of FM remains poorly understood, and that current products only manage the symptoms of FM. We believe our paradigm changing discovery that herpes virus could play an important role in the pathogenesis of FM. If successfully proven, we believe that IMC-1 can be disruptive to the market and can change the way FM is treated. 
Furthermore, there is increasing recognition in the scientific community of the potential role of activated viruses, triggering a wide range of morbidities, including FM, IBS, fatigue related disorders and potentially dementia and even long Covid (“Long-COVID”) symptoms. The Company provided the Bateman Horne Center (“BHC”) with an unrestricted grant for an investigator-sponsored study to explore the therapeutic potential of combination antiviral therapy with Virios’ second development candidate, IMC-2, a combination of valacyclovir and celecoxib. The study is evaluating changes in common Long-COVID symptoms such as fatigue, sleep, attention, pain, autonomic function and anxiety and commenced dosing in the third quarter of 2022. The study is fully enrolled with data expected in mid-2023. 
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and our product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business.
As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio of owned patents totaled 21 issued patents in the United States and abroad. This includes three Composition of Matter patents, including a Synergistic Patent, and two Method of Use patents in the United States, all of which relate to IMC-1. Exclusivity with all patents extends to 2033.

Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
We have also been granted additional U.S. and EU patents, representing all possible combinations of targeted antivirals and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs/COX-2s) containing appropriate COX-2 & COX-1 inhibition. At present, we are developing only IMC-1 (famciclovir/celecoxib) with the other 

29



patents being obtained to increase the therapeutic combinations that we may explore in the future to treat other virally medicated illnesses.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties have prepared and filed patent applications prior to March 16, 2013 in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO, to determine priority of invention. For more information, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Material Agreements
In 2012, we entered into a Know-How License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with the University of Alabama. In consideration for the License Agreement, the University of Alabama received membership interests in the Company representing 10% of the issued membership interests at that time. The License Agreement is in effect for 25 years and will terminate on June 1, 2037. Under the License Agreement, we were granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to utilize, including the right to sublicense and sell products incorporating, the know-how, technical information, and data related and pertaining to the herpesvirus biology, including herpesvirus replication mechanisms, modes of action of anti-herpesvirus medications, and sensitivity and accuracy of herpesvirus diagnostic tests, any of which were developed by the University of Alabama under the direction of Dr. Carol Duffy before the effective date of the License Agreement, all of which is defined as the Technical Information. The University of Alabama reserved the right to use the Technical Information for educational, research, clinical, and other non-commercial purposes. We may assign the license to any purchaser or transferee of substantially all of our assets.
Sales and Marketing
If IMC-1 is approved, we plan to enter into sales and marketing agreements with one or several pharmaceutical companies to sell to neurologists, geriatric specialists and to primary care physicians.
Manufacturing
We rely on third-party contractors for manufacturing clinical supplies and plan to do so for commercial amounts also. Presently we are working with an overseas supplier for the manufacture of the cGMP API and with a local supplier for the storage stability, encapsulating, blister packing, blinding and distribution of the capsules or pills to the clinical sites.
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation of Drug Products
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

30



Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (“GLP”) regulations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an NDA.
--+---------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to initiate.

31



Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it initiates at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies or trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA, for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.
The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, 

32



and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.

33



To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
In addition, products tested for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
Accelerated Approval Pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug influences a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.

34



For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease if the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.

35



Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments and list their marketed drug products with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs or devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of our product candidate, IMC-1, or any other development candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the U.S. will 

36



depend in part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by payors.
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. Medicare Part D, Medicare’s outpatient prescription drug benefit, contains protections to ensure coverage and reimbursement for oral oncology products, and all Part D prescription drug plans are required to cover substantially all oral anti-cancer agents. However, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Sales of IMC-1 or any other candidates will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payors. Achieving favorable coverage and reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and/or the Medicare Administrative Contractors is typically a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our operations include:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value;

● | federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the

Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and report to CMS payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer. Many states have their own Sunshine laws governing the tracking and reporting of payments to healthcare providers.

The Hatch-Waxman Amendments and Generic Competition
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA.
Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as “the Hatch-Waxman Amendments” to the FDCA and enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved or for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
ANDA Approval Process
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also established an abbreviated FDA approval process for drugs that are shown to be bioequivalent to drugs previously approved by the FDA through the NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by filing an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) with the FDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA, as applicable, that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be 

38



infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding a patented method-of-use that is approved for the reference drug, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
If within 45 days of receipt of a Paragraph IV Notification the NDA holder for the reference drug and/or patent owners initiates a patent infringement lawsuit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification (the 30-Month Stay), expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit with a finding of patent invalidity or non-infringement, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant.
The ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
Non-Patent Exclusivity
In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. A fixed combination drug product may receive NCE exclusivity if one of its active ingredients is an NCE, but not if all of its active ingredients have previously been approved. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug, except that the FDA may accept such an application for filing after four years if the application includes a paragraph IV certification to a listed patent. In the case of such applications accepted for filing between four and five years after approval of the reference drug, a 30-Month Stay of approval triggered by a timely patent infringement lawsuit is extended by the amount of time necessary to extend the stay until 7-1/2 years after the approval of the reference drug NDA.
A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical trials (other than bioavailability studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period.
Regulation Outside the United States
To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
To market our future products in the EEA (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory 

39



approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of marketing authorizations:

● | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member countries of the EEA assess the risk-benefit balance of the product based on scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Data and Marketing Exclusivity
In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Orphan Drug Designation
In the EEA, a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in development. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
In the EEA, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, the EMA or the member state 

40



competent authorities, cannot accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization, for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for medicines that have also complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan.
This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of “clinical superiority” by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for incentives made available by the EU and its Member States to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had four full-time employees. Accordingly, a high percentage of our work performed for our development projects is outsourced to qualified independent contractors. All employees and contractors are subject to contractual agreements that specify requirements for confidentiality, ownership of newly developed intellectual property and restrictions on working for competitors as well as other matters.
Facilities
We do not own or lease any offices at this time other than a “virtual office” at the address set forth on the cover page of this Annual Report.
