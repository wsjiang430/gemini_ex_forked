ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Background
 
IGC has two lines of business: 1) infrastructure, and 2) plant and cannabinoid-based products and therapies. The Company’s infrastructure business, based in India and Hong Kong involves (a) the rental of heavy construction equipment like bulldozers, excavators, rollers and pavers, among others; (b) execution of construction contracts; and (c) the purchase and resale of physical commodities used in infrastructure, like steel, marble and tiles (collectively, the “Infrastructure Business”). Our revenue in Fiscal 2019 was primarily derived from this business. Information about our infrastructure products and service offerings is available at www.igcinc.us.
 
Our second line of business (collectively, the “Plant and Cannabinoid Business”) stems from plant extracts, including cannabinoids, produced by the cannabis plant (“phytocannabinoids”). Our plant and cannabinoid-based products and therapies involve several brands that the Company develops and expects to commercialize. The Company’s flagship branded, patent pending, product is Hyalolex™, a cannabinoid based alternative therapy, aimed at helping improve the quality of life for elderly patients suffering from dementia including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Other alternative therapies in development include therapies for neuropathic pain, Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders, among others. Hyalolex™ is based on a patent filing made by the University of South Florida for the use of ultra-low doses of cannabinoids for the treatment of AD. Further information is available at www.igcpharma.com and www.hyalolex.com. In addition, the Company, under the brand name Holi Hemp™, sells hemp crude extract, hemp isolate, and hemp distillate, among others. Further information is available at www.holihemp.com.
 
The cannabis plant includes a variety commonly known as marijuana, and a variety known as hemp. These plants all produce, in varying degrees, molecules such as Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a molecule that mimics anandamide, a cannabinoid naturally produced by the human body, that creates a sense of euphoria. THC is the psychoactive molecule in cannabis. The cannabis plant also produces many other cannabinoids. Among them, cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive molecule, which is the target of medical research. Under the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the 2018 Farm Bill), Hemp is classified as a cannabis plant that has THC below 0.3% by dry weight and marijuana is classified as a cannabis plant that has THC above 0.3% by dry weight.
 
As of March 31, 2019, the Company had the following direct operating subsidiaries: Techni Bharathi Private Limited (TBL), IGCare LLC, Holi Hemp LLC and IGC Pharma LLC. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on March 31. The Company is a Maryland corporation established in 2005. The Company’s filings are available on www.sec.gov.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our strategy for the Infrastructure Business is to a) continue to rent heavy equipment to agricultural and construction contractors; b) invest in and competitively bid on constructions contracts, for example to build roads, bridges, and other civil works in Kerala India; and c) buy and sell infrastructure commodities. The Company expects to expand this line of business with the purchase of heavy equipment, bank guarantees, and an increase in employees and consultants.

With respect to the Company’s second line of business, the Company’s strategy is to create, build, and manage several brands of plant and cannabinoid-based therapies, such as Hyalolex™, Serosapse™, Natrinol™ and products under Holi Hemp™, among others. As part of this strategy, the Company expects to secure its supply chain by setting up facilities that grow, process and extract hemp. If market demand for cannabinoids, such as CBD and full spectrum hemp oil (an extraction of the whole plant), grows, as predicted by some analysts, we expect to sell these products on a retail and wholesale basis. In addition, we are also exploring acquisitions, investments, or the creation of joint ventures with competitive and complementary businesses, products and technologies. The Company believes that ongoing and expanded investment in clinical trials, Research and Development (R&D), facilities, marketing and advertising, as well as the acquisition of products and businesses supporting our Plant and Cannabinoid Business, is critical to the development and delivery of innovative products and best in class patient experience. Our strategy for plant and cannabinoid-based alternative therapy and products is to leverage our R&D and our intellectual property, to develop unique products that are best in class, well differentiated and backed by science through planned pre-clinical and clinical trials. This strategy in some cases may lead to perceived improvements in existing products and the creation of new products in others, which, based on scientific study and research, we expect may offer positive results for the treatment of certain conditions, symptoms and/or side effects. Our longer-term strategy is to seek pharmaceutical status for our therapies by filing Investigative New Drug Applications (INDA) with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and conducting large medical trials.

Products & Services
 
Infrastructure Business
 
Our Infrastructure Business, based in India and Hong Kong, involves:
 
a.  The rental of heavy construction equipment including bulldozers, excavators, rollers, and pavers, to contractors. This business involves a fleet of equipment that TBL owns, maintains and operates. The business is seasonal and is primarily active during the non-monsoon season. The business is dependent on infrastructure projects that the government implements;
 b.  Bidding and execution of construction contracts; Our subsidiary TBL, with over 30 years of experience with infrastructure projects, recently began work on building and modifying a road in Kerala, India. In January 2019, TBL received a construction contract for the building of a National Highway Authority of India (“NHAI”)-sponsored local highway for approximately $0.6 million. This is a line that the Company expects to expand with the purchase of heavy equipment, bank guarantees, and an expanded team. TBL is currently executing this contract and expects to recognize revenue in Fiscal 2020;
 c.  The purchase and resale of physical commodities used in infrastructure including steel, marble and tiles.
 
Plant and Cannabinoid Business:
 
We focus on the development and commercialization of plant and cannabinoid-based products and therapies. None of our plant and cannabinoid-based products or therapies are FDA-approved pharmaceuticals. Cannabinoids are chemical compounds that, based on various scientific studies and research, show various effects on the body and behavior. For example, a study1 by Prof. Krista Lanctot presented at Neurology Live-2018, in Chicago, showed that synthetic THC exerts a range of effects on behavior, including improvement in agitation and cognitive behavior, in patients suffering from AD. Several other studies have indicated that cannabinoids exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and, may alleviate diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.
 
Phytocannabinoids are cannabinoids that occur naturally in the cannabis plant. Phytocannabinoids are abundant in the viscous resin produced by glandular structures called trichomes. There are over 480 different compounds in the cannabis plant. Many of them have been identified as cannabinoids. Of these, THC is the main psychoactive component in the plant with many believed therapeutic uses. The other broadly pursued non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid is CBD. Both THC and CBD are pleiotropic i.e. studies indicate they may influence multiple pathways in humans, dogs and cats, and are believed to provide relief to a variety of symptoms including pain, seizures, and eating disorders. In medical applications, cannabinoids are extracted from the plant using a variety of well-established technologies, including using solvents such as CO2, Butane, and alcohol, among others. The refined extracted material is isolated for specific active ingredients, such as THC and CBD, among others, and is used in formulations as the primary or secondary active ingredient.
 
Hyalolex™

Hyalolex™ is not approved by the FDA, and it is not considered a pharmaceutical drug.
 
The name Hyalolex™, is based on the Greek roots hyalo and lex that broadly mean clear, clarity and/or glass-like, and words and/or reading, respectively. In AD cell lines, AD animal models, and in some human studies, the active ingredients in Hyalolex™ have been shown to alleviate many of the symptoms associated with AD.2 Patients with AD may suffer from a variety of symptoms, including anxiety, agitation, dementia, and sleep disorder, among others. These symptoms often result in hard-to-manage patients and caregiver distress.

Our research into plant and cannabinoid-based combination therapies led us to studies performed at the University of South Florida (USF) using cannabinoids on AD. The professor working on this approach was featured on CNN on Dr. Sanjay Gupta’s show Weed 3. The work, specifically, reported several findings that were subsequently filed as a patent that we refer to as IGC-AD1. In Fiscal 2017, we acquired exclusive rights to the data and the patent filing from USF. The research reported that micro-dosing of the cannabinoid THC, in combination with other naturally occurring compounds, works synergistically to reduce the buildup of plaques and tangles, through allegedly new pathways. These results were shown using Alzheimer’s cell lines. Plaques and tangles are hallmarks of AD. Studies have demonstrated that patients get plaques and tangles around 15 to 20 years before any AD related symptoms such as dementia manifest. The studies further showed, on Alzheimer’s cell lines, that micro dosing of cannabinoids in combination with other naturally occurring compounds can increase the functioning of mitochondria. The findings are unique as previous research into cannabinoids showed the opposite effect at higher doses, for example, loss of mitochondrial functioning.
 
We believe that the novelty is two-fold: first, that micro dosing of THC affects the brain differently from higher dosing that is prescribed (FDA-approved Dronabinol, for example) or consumed by individuals; and second, that micro doses of THC can work synergistically with other naturally occurring compounds to increase efficacy and reduce side effects. For example, the research showed that at these therapeutic micro-doses, THC is non-toxic to neurons, a finding contrary to other research and data showing that THC is neuro-toxic at higher ingestion levels. The research was extended to include a Morris Water Maze test for measuring spatial memory impairment on transgenic Alzheimer’s mice. The research indicated that transgenic Alzheimer’s mice treated with cannabinoids at certain doses were significantly better at negotiating the water maze than untreated transgenic Alzheimer’s mice. As expected, neither group were anywhere close to the performance of healthy mice. Preliminary findings have also reported that low doses of THC can play a role in triggering neurogenesis, the growth and development of neuronal tissue.3
 
After further research and experiments, our team created Hyalolex™, an oral formulation as a syrup.
 
QR code-based blockchain PIA
 
Through consultancy relationships, the Company has developed, completed and expects to deploy a QR code-based, Hyperledger-blockchain-based PIA system that allows patients to access a website with information on our products, including where to buy the products. As the number of states in which the product is available increases, we hope to expand the information populating the backend to inputs directly from growers, processors and dispensaries. This information is intended to collectively display product identification and product origination by providing the patient with information regarding the origin, chemicals and processes used to manufacture the product.
 
Serosapse™ and Natrinol™
 
Other products that we are developing include Serosapse™ designed to assist in the treatment of certain indications of PD and other CNS disorders; and Natrinol™ designed to assist in the treatment of certain indications of neuropathic pain. The Company filed a patent application for Serosapse™ in March 2018. The Company received a patent for the formulation in Natrinol™ in November 2018. Neither of these products are FDA-approved, and they are not considered to be pharmaceutical drugs.
Holi Hemp™
 
We buy hemp crude extract, outsource the refinement of extract, and sell refined extracts such as hemp distillate and hemp isolate through our brand Holi Hemp™. The Company expects to secure its supply chain in Fiscal 2020 and beyond by investing in facilities that grow, process, and extract hemp.

Markets and Distribution
 
Infrastructure Business
 
For (a) the equipment rental business, we rent heavy equipment to construction companies, mostly located in Kerala, India. With respect to (b) bidding and executing of construction contracts; our subsidiary TBL, with over 30 years of experience with infrastructure projects recently began work on building and modifying a road in Kerala, India. In January 2019, TBL received a construction contract for the building of a National Highway Authority of India (“NHAI”) sponsored local highway for approximately $0.6 million. This is a line that the Company expects to expand with the purchase of heavy equipment, bank guarantees, and the retention of additional employees and consultants. TBL is currently executing this contract and expects to recognize revenue in Fiscal 2020, and with respect to (c) the purchase and resale of physical commodities, we purchase infrastructure materials and resell them. We neither hedge nor take long term positions on infrastructure commodities, and we limit our financial exposure by contractually ensuring that purchases have vetted buyers and settlement dates.
 
In Fiscal 2019, we have a total of 5 customers and 3 suppliers of infrastructure materials, which account for over 10% of sales and cost of sales. In Fiscal 2019, our suppliers are companies based in India and Hong Kong. For the level of business, and the value of each trade, we believe that the number of customers we have does not constitute inordinate customer risk. The total revenue from our Infrastructure Business is less than 1% based on revenue of the rental, construction and infrastructure commodities markets.
 
Plant and Cannabinoid Business
 
Hyalolex™
 
AD has been referred to as America’s most expensive disease. The estimated cost to Medicare and Medicaid of AD and other dementias, as per the Alzheimer’s Association, is projected to be about $2904 billion in 2019. It is estimated that there are currently over 5.8 million4 Americans with AD and around 50 million5 worldwide. The cost of AD is skyrocketing as the baby-boomers age: the number of AD patients is expected to double over the next 20 years, and the direct costs are expected to exceed $450 billion in the next 12 years. Although the rate of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is believed to be between three and nine years. It is the most common cause of dementia among older adults. Currently, no treatment can stop or reverse the progression of the disease, and there is still no accepted cure for AD. After launching Hyalolex™ in Puerto Rico, we expect to launch in other countries and certain states in the U.S. where we can legally enter the market.
 
Hyalolex™ is formulated for a dose of 1 ml either two or three times a day. It is currently available in 30 ml bottles.
 
To ensure compliance and product assurance, we propose to deploy a QR code-based, Hyperledger-blockchain-based, PIA system that will track the product and allow patients to access information about the product and provide feedback.
 
Our plans for Hyalolex™ in Fiscal 2020 are to file an INDA with the FDA and commence to conduct a pivotal phase 2 trial using a protocol that currently targets measuring Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) in patients suffering from AD. The Filing of an INDA with the FDA is no guarantee that the FDA will approve the application.

Serosapse™ and Natrinol™
 
The pain management market represents a significant component of the healthcare system. In September 2012, The Journal of Pain reported that the annual estimated national cost of pain ranges from $560 billion to $635 billion. This figure exceeds the entire cost of the nation’s priority health conditions. Additionally, the American Pain Society recommends that pain be made more visible and be categorized as the fifth vital sign, recognizing that terminal illnesses are often accompanied by unbearable levels of pain that are so severe and difficult to treat that death seems preferable. According to the Arthritis Foundation, arthritis has been particularly problematic for women. Since 1999 there has been a 22% increase in the number of women who attribute their disability to arthritis. Current treatment protocols such as the utilization of opioid-based drug therapies present several challenges and may result in debilitating consequences that affect patients’ day-to-day functioning and patients’ productivity. Commonly reported side effects include hallucinations, constipation, sedation, nausea, respiratory depression and dysphoria. Our patent filing is based on therapy that uses extracts from the cannabinoids plant for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and scleroderma pain. The therapy uses a cream that is applied to the joints using a variety of delivery mechanisms, including a bio-adhesive patch.
 
There are over one million adults suffering from PD in the U.S. PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide with an estimated 1% of adults over 60 suffering from the disease. The market for curing the disease is very large. We are testing products for end points associated with PD such as REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep disorder, anxiety, and dyskinesia. The PD treatment market is expected to reach $5.69 billion by 2022 from $4.24 billion in 2017, at a CAGR of 6.1%6. The market is being driven by the growth in aging population and the associated increase in the prevalence of PD and government funding for research.
 
Approximately 50 million people worldwide are affected by epilepsy7. Epilepsy is thought to be due to multiple factors that include the alteration of many ion channels such as sodium, potassium, NMDA (N-Methyl-d-aspartate) and neurotransmitters such as GABA (gamma amino butyric acid). It is believed, for example, that to maximally control epilepsy, modulation of one or more of these channels and receptors is required and that monotherapy is adequate in up to 25% of patients. The onset of epileptic seizures can be life threatening and lead to long-term implications8 such as mental health problems, cognitive deficits and morphological changes.9 The onset of epilepsy also greatly affects lifestyle as sufferers may live in fear of consequential injury or the inability to perform daily tasks.10 The scientific community11 has shown that CBD has anti-convulsive properties in humans. Other studies12 have shown that micro-doses of THC can also help reduce seizures. Three of our patent filings involving therapies use phytocannabinoid extracts from cannabinoids, in combination with other generic drugs, to treat medical refractory epilepsy in humans and seizures in dogs and cats.
 
Cachexia is a condition that accompanies severe illness, such as cancer, and may result in the weakness of the body. Cachexia may physically weaken patients to the extent that response to standard treatments is poor. In the U.S., it is estimated that a population of approximately 1.4 million13 is experiencing cachexia associated with cancer, multiple sclerosis, PD, HIV/AIDS, and other progressive illnesses. Cachexia is secondary to an underlying disease such as cancer or AIDS and is a positive risk factor for death. As an example, cancer induced anorexia cachexia is responsible for about 20% of all cancer deaths. Our patent filing involves a therapy that uses phytocannabinoids in an effort to stimulate senses (smell and taste) with a combination of drugs to stimulate appetite. Our approach addresses the veterinarian market, as dogs and cats also suffer from pain, epilepsy, and cachexia, and getting a product to market for the veterinarian industry is significantly less time consuming than getting products approved for human healthcare. There are around 185 million domesticated dogs and cats in the U.S., and about 1% of dogs and 2% of cats suffer from seizures.14

Holi Hemp™
 
The Company intends to sell its plant and cannabinoid-based products including hemp oil, hemp distillate and isolate, among others under the brand name Holi Hemp™. Since the legal hemp industry in the U.S. is new, we neither have a major supplier nor dependence on a major customer. For the level of business and the value of each trade, the number of customers we have is adequate and does not constitute inordinate customer risk. Revenue from our Holi Hemp™ products is less than 1% based on revenue of markets. 
Research and Development
 
In Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, IGC identified combinations of micro-doses of THC and the non-psychoactive compound CBD to address symptoms of PD and other diseases. The costs associated with this work is mostly internal research, such as, looking for combinations of plant extracts that could work and data to support the claims that certain combinations and formulations can alleviate symptoms associated with diseases.
 
In Fiscal 2019 we incorporated IGC Pharma LLC to consolidate and continue to conduct R&D. The amount spent for R&D is approximately $1.3 million and $137 thousand in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. All R&D costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
 
Competition
 
Some of the markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and some are not, as described below:
 
1.  Infrastructure Business: This business is currently limited to India and Hong Kong. The infrastructure industry is highly competitive, and we believe our differentiation is based primarily on price and industry knowledge of construction and commodity requirements for infrastructure projects. In Fiscal 2019, apart from working capital, the Company invested $300 thousand in TBL, to bid on construction contracts. While competition is strong, we expect demand for infrastructure projects to again increase with the newly elected Indian government once again focusing on infrastructure.
2.  Plant and Cannabinoid Business: In the U.S., there is very little widespread research on phytocannabinoids, with most of the research concentrated in Israel and Canada. This is largely because the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administrating (DEA) classifies phytocannabinoid extracts such as THC as a Schedule 1 drug. This means that phytocannabinoids are characterized as substances with “high potential for abuse” and with “no currently accepted medical use.” We believe our differentiation from our competitors, for example, in the use of phytocannabinoids for the treatment of AD, is based primarily on our data, patent filings, experienced team, and early-mover advantage.
 
Core business competencies and advantages
 
Our core competencies include the following: 
 •  a network of doctors, PhDs, and intellectual property legal experts that have a sophisticated understanding of drug discovery, research, FDA filings, intellectual protection and product formulation;
 •  knowledge of various cannabinoids strains, their phytocannabinoid profile, extraction methodology and impact on various pathways;
 •  knowledge of plant and cannabinoid-based combination therapies;
 •  knowledge of research and development in the field; and
 •  Patent IGC-501 for cannabinoids and pain has been issued.
 
 11


Technology, Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property
 
The success of most of our product candidates will depend in large part on our ability to:
 •  penetrate and create a market for our products,
 •  obtain and maintain patent and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
 •  prosecute our patent applications and defend our issued patents;
 •  preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
 •  operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
 
On October 12, 2018, the Company filed a provisional patent with the USPTO for a CBD-infused energy drink titled “Method and Composition for Relieving Fatigue and Restoring Energy.” There can be no guarantee that the USPTO will grant the patent.
 
We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for certain of our product candidates, drug delivery systems, and molecular modifications, as well as other proprietary technologies and their uses, by filing patent applications in the U.S. and selected other countries. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for medical uses, processes for preparation, processes for delivery and formulations.
 
We have intellectual property attorneys that file patents or provisional patent applications, copyrights, trademark and trade secret laws of general applicability, employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreements. We also expect to deploy a QR code-based PIA and other intellectual property protection methods to safeguard our technology and research and development. All our data, except accounting data, is stored in the cloud on multiple servers that helps us mitigate the overall risk of losing data. We have a cybersecurity policy in place and are in the process of implementing tighter cybersecurity measures to safeguard against hackers. We expect to implement these measures in Fiscal 2020. The Company holds all rights to the patents that have been filed by us with the USPTO. Although, the Company believes the registration of patents is an important part of its business strategy and its success depends in part on such registration, the Company cannot guarantee that such patent filings will result in a successful registration with the USPTO. Please see Item 1A, Risk Factors- “We may not successfully register the provisional patents with the USPTO”.

Governmental Regulations 
 
In the U.S. we are subject to oversight and regulations, for some or all of our activities, by the following agencies: SEC, state regulators, NYSE, and the FDA. As mentioned above, the cannabis plant consists of several strains or varieties. Hemp and Marijuana are both cannabis plants. Under the 2018 Farm Bill, Hemp is classified as a cannabis plant that has THC below 0.3% by dry weight. Marijuana is classified as a cannabis plant that has THC above 0.3% by dry weight.
 
Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, including in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized for medical and or recreational use. On the other hand, on December 12, 2018, the Senate and the House approved the 2018 Farm Bill that the President signed into law. It contains provisions that make industrial hemp legal. Although, effective January 1, 2019, hemp is legal at the federal level, most states are only now creating appropriate licensing and testing processes for the growing, processing, and sale of hemp and hemp-derived products.
 
For our business we must apply for licenses in states where we desire to grow and process hemp, for example, in the state of Arizona, where we plan on growing and processing hemp, we are required to apply for licenses and register with the state the geo-location of all our operations, including the land on which hemp is grown and the facilitates where hemp will be processed. These regulations are evolving, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to change.
 
FDA Approval Process
 
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern the research, development, testing, manufacturing, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and importing and exporting of pharmaceutical products, among other things. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as imposition of clinical holds, FDA refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (NDA), warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. typically involves pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests and the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. For commercial approval, the sponsor must submit adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show that the drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling. The sponsor must also submit substantial evidence, generally consisting of adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to establish that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling. In certain cases, the FDA may determine that a drug is effective based on one clinical study plus confirmatory evidence. Satisfaction of FDA premarket approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity of the product or disease.

Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, and formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including the FDA’s good laboratory practices regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) regulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act. The results of pre-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term pre-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not imposed a clinical hold on the IND or otherwise commented or questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors, and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In general, in Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. The FDA may, however, determine that a drug is effective based on one clinical study plus confirmatory evidence. Only a small percentage of investigational drugs complete all three phases and obtain marketing approval. In some cases, the FDA may require post-market studies, known as Phase 4 studies, to be conducted as a condition of approval in order to gather additional information on the drug’s effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. Depending on the risks posed by the drugs, other post-market requirements may be imposed. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls.
 
The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, for Fiscal 2019 $2,588,478, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program fees, for Fiscal 2019 $309,915.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the statute and implementing regulations, the FDA has 180 days (the initial review cycle) from the date of filing to issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter, unless the review period is adjusted by mutual agreement between the FDA and the applicant or as a result of the applicant submitting a major amendment. In practice, the performance goals established pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act have effectively extended the initial review cycle beyond 180 days. The FDA’s current performance goals call for the FDA to complete review of 90 percent of standard (non-priority) NDAs within 10 months of receipt and within six months for priority NDAs, but two additional months are added to standard and priority NDAs for a new molecular entity (NME).

The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current GMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing 90 percent of resubmissions within two to six months depending on the type of information included.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Under a new rule, effective January 18, 2017, sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of these trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for up to two years if the sponsor certifies that it is seeking approval of an unapproved product or that it will file an application for approval of a new indication for an approved product within one year. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
 
Orange Book Listing
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent the claims of which cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are considered to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug, are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug in accordance with state law.
 
 15


The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement, certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
 
Exclusivity
 
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking approval of a drug that references a version of the NCE drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that includes the change.
 
An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification and thus no ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
 
For a botanical drug, the FDA may determine that the active moiety is one or more of the principal components or the complex mixture as a whole. This determination would affect the utility of any five-year exclusivity as well as the ability of any potential generic competitor to demonstrate that it is the same drug as the original botanical drug.
 
Five-year and three-year exclusivities do not preclude FDA approval of a 505(b)(1) application for a duplicate version of the drug during the period of exclusivity, provided that the 505(b)(1) applicant conducts or obtains a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Patent Term Extension
 
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase — the time between IND submission and NDA submission — and all of the review phase — the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not
 exceed 14 years. 
 
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the PTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.

Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. (or affects more than 200,000 in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. of such drug). Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. If the FDA designates an orphan drug based on a finding of clinical superiority, the FDA must provide a written notification to the sponsor that states the basis for orphan designation, including “any plausible hypothesis” relied upon by the FDA. The FDA must also publish a summary of its clinical superiority findings upon granting orphan drug exclusivity based on clinical superiority. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
Special Protocol Assessment
 
A company may reach an agreement with the FDA under the Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, process as to the required design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. According to its performance goals, the FDA is supposed to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record. Under the FDC Act and FDA guidance implementing the statutory requirement, an SPA is generally binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy after the study begins, public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, the sponsor and the FDA agree to the change in writing, or if the study sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA.
