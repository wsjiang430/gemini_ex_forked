Item 1.    Business.
Our History 
Hyatt was founded by Jay Pritzker in 1957 when he purchased the Hyatt House motel adjacent to the Los Angeles International Airport. In 2004, substantially all of the hospitality assets owned by Pritzker family business interests, including Hyatt Corporation and Hyatt International Corporation, were consolidated under a single entity whose name was subsequently changed to Global Hyatt Corporation. On June 30, 2009, Global Hyatt Corporation changed its name to Hyatt Hotels Corporation. We completed our initial public offering of our Class A common stock on November 10, 2009.
Overview 
Hyatt Hotels Corporation is a global hospitality company with widely recognized, industry leading brands and a tradition of innovation developed over our sixty-year history. We develop, own, operate, manage, franchise, license, or provide services to a portfolio of properties, consisting of full service hotels, select service hotels, resorts, and other properties, including branded spas and fitness studios, timeshare, fractional, and other forms of residential, vacation, and condominium ownership units. At December 31, 2018, our worldwide hotel portfolio consisted of 843 hotels (208,207 rooms). See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview" for a categorized breakdown of our portfolio.
Our full service properties operate under seven brands: Park Hyatt, Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Regency, Hyatt, Andaz, Hyatt Centric, and The Unbound Collection by Hyatt. Additionally, in 2018, we acquired Two Roads Hospitality LLC ("Two Roads") and added five brands to our portfolio - Alila, Destination, Thompson, Joie de Vivre, and tommie. In 2017, we acquired Miraval Group ("Miraval") and Exhale Enterprises, Inc. ("Exhale"), forming a distinct wellness category within our portfolio of brands. Our two select service brands are Hyatt Place and Hyatt House. Our all-inclusive resort brands are Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara. We also manage, provide services to, or license our trademarks with respect to residential ownership units that are often adjacent to a Hyatt-branded full service hotel. Additionally, for condominium ownership units, we provide services and/or manage the rental programs or homeowner associations associated with such units. We consult with third parties in the design and development of such mixed-use projects. We license certain of our trademarks with respect to vacation ownership units, which are part of Hyatt Residence Club. 
Substantially all of our hotel general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry with extensive hospitality experience in their local markets and host countries. The general managers of our managed properties are empowered to operate their properties on an independent basis using their market knowledge, management experience, and understanding of our brands. Our colleagues and hotel general managers are supported by our regional management teams located in cities around the world and our executive management team, headquartered in Chicago. 
We primarily derive our revenues from owned and leased hotel operations, management, franchise, and other fees, and other revenues from managed and franchised properties. For each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, revenues totaled $4.5 billion, net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation totaled $769 million and $389 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA totaled $777 million and $792 million, respectively. See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Business Metrics Evaluated by Management—Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") and EBITDA" for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, why we present it, and for a reconciliation of our net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented. 
Our Purpose, Vision, Mission, and Values

To deliver distinctive experiences for our guests.

Our Values
Respect, integrity, humility, empathy, creativity, and fun are our shared core values. 
Our purpose, vision, mission, and values are brought to life by our colleagues, whom we refer to as the Hyatt family. We believe our colleagues embody our purpose of caring for people, including each other, our guests, and ultimately our property owners. This commitment to genuine service and care is what differentiates us and drives guest preference. The management teams at each of our managed properties lead by example, and we provide them with the appropriate autonomy to make operational decisions in the best interests of the hotel and brand. We believe the managers of our franchised properties are experienced operators with high standards who have demonstrated commitment to our values and our approach to caring for guests to enhance guest satisfaction. High levels of guest satisfaction lead to increased guest preference for our brands, which we believe results in a strengthened revenue base over the long term. We also believe engaged colleagues will enhance efficient operation of our properties, resulting in improved financial results for our owners. Sustained adherence to these principles is a basis for our brand reputation and is one of the principal factors behind the decisions of our diverse group of owners and developers to invest in the Hyatt portfolio of properties around the world. We work with existing and prospective owners and developers to increase our presence around the world, which we expect will lead to guest satisfaction, brand preference, and new channels of professional growth for our colleagues. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
We have significant competitive strengths that support our mission to deliver distinctive experiences for our guests and drive growth and create value for our customers, colleagues, and shareholders. 
World Class Brands.    We believe our widely recognized, industry-leading brands provide us with a competitive advantage in attracting and driving preference. We have consistently received top rankings, awards, and accolades for service and guest experience from independent publications and surveys, including Condé Nast Traveler, Travel and Leisure, Forbes, AAA, and J.D. Power. Our brand recognition and strength are key to our ability to drive preference. 
Global Platform with Compelling Growth Potential.    Our existing global presence is widely distributed, and our hotels operate in some of the most populous urban centers around the globe. We believe our existing hotels, located in key markets around the globe, provide us with a strong platform from which to selectively pursue new growth opportunities in markets where our brands are less prevalent. Our dedicated development executives in offices around the world apply their experience, market expertise, and knowledge to ensure the Hyatt portfolio of properties enhances preference for our brands. An important aspect of our compelling growth potential is our strong brand presence in higher growth markets such as Greater China and India. The combination of our existing locations and brands, experienced development team, World of Hyatt loyalty program, established third-party relationships, and significant access to capital provides us with a strong foundation for future growth and long-term value creation. 
Deep Culture and Experienced Management Teams.    Hyatt has a strong culture rooted in values that have supported our past success and form the foundation for our future. The members of the Hyatt family are united by shared values, a single purpose, and common goals that include delivering experiences that drive customer preference while driving efficient hotel operations and strong owner returns. Our colleagues at Hyatt properties are guided by an experienced and dedicated team including general managers and regional leadership teams that provide resources, mentorship and coaching, owner support, and other assistance. The general managers at our full service managed hotels have an average tenure of approximately 18 years, and senior operating management has an average of approximately 30 years of experience in the industry. Our seasoned executive management team sets overall policies for our Company, supports our regional teams and our colleagues around the world, provides strategic direction, and leads our global growth initiatives. 
Strong Capital Base and Disciplined Financial Approach.    Our approach is to maintain appropriate levels of financial leverage through industry cycles and economic downturns. At December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $686 million and available borrowing capacity of $1.5 billion. We believe that as a result of our balance sheet strength, we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of strategic opportunities to develop or acquire properties and brands or invest in new lines of business. We adhere to a formal investment process in evaluating such opportunities with input from various groups within our global organization. 
Diverse Exposure to Hotel Management, Franchising, Ownership, and Development.    We believe our experience as a global multi-brand manager, franchisor, owner, and developer of hotels makes us one of the best positioned hospitality companies in the world. Our mix of managed, franchised, and owned properties provides a 
5

broad and diverse base of revenues, profits, and cash flows and gives us flexibility to evaluate growth opportunities across our lines of business. 
High-Quality Owned Hotels are Located in Desirable Markets and are a Source of Capital for New Growth Investments.    At December 31, 2018, our owned and leased portfolio totaled 40 owned or leased properties (33 of which are owned) and 22 managed or franchised properties that are owned or leased (21 of which are owned) by unconsolidated hospitality ventures. Our owned full service hotels are located primarily in key markets, including major business centers and leisure destinations with strong growth potential, such as Chicago, London, New York, Paris, Miami, Seoul, and Zurich. Our unconsolidated hospitality ventures include 50% ownership interests in properties in Mumbai and São Paulo. A number of our owned hotels and unconsolidated hospitality venture properties are unique assets with high brand recognition and a strong position in their local markets. We believe our owned assets provide us the opportunity to support growth through the disposition of selected assets to fund expansions of our core business as well as the opportunity to unlock additional shareholder value through targeted dispositions that allow for incremental return of capital to shareholders or additional strategic investments that provide new avenues for growth. 
Our Business Strategy 
Our strategy to drive long-term sustainable growth and create value for customers, colleagues, and shareholders is focused on the following three areas:

• | Maximize Our Core Business: We will continue to grow and operate our core business to the best of our ability in order to be best-in-class while generating profits to fuel our growth.


• | Integrate New Growth Platforms: We are identifying new opportunities and areas to invest in which our guests care about and that provide additional paths for growth (including wellness-related businesses).


• | Optimize Capital Deployment: We are taking a comprehensive and disciplined approach to our deployment of capital, including the sell-down of a portion of our owned real estate. We believe this will allow us to fuel the growth of our core management and franchising business, invest in new growth platforms, and return capital to our shareholders.

We implement our strategy through a focus on four strategic priorities:
Cultivate the Best People and Evolve the Culture
We focus on cultivating the best people and evolving the culture by attracting, developing, rewarding, and retaining individuals who distinguish Hyatt from our competitors and provide a unique experience to our guests. We recognize our people and our culture are our greatest assets and the core of our strategy. Our goal is to develop a strong pipeline of colleagues who are purpose driven, bring diverse perspectives, and have an agile, entrepreneurial mindset and to provide them with opportunities to fulfill their personal potential and development while helping to make Hyatt successful. 
Our brands are defined, in large part, by the commitment to genuine service and care that our colleagues deliver to our guests. We believe that while a great product is necessary for success, a service model that promotes genuine care for our guests and focuses on their particular needs is the key to a sustainable long-term advantage. Therefore, we strive to involve our colleagues in deciding how we care for our guests and identifying what we can do to improve guest satisfaction. We rely on our hotel general managers to lead by example and foster colleague engagement. In addition, we are focused on providing colleagues with the tools and technology needed to perform their jobs more effectively and efficiently to allow for further engagement with guests. We believe colleague engagement results in higher levels of customer satisfaction and improves the performance of our properties. To assist in this process, we aim to ensure talented management teams are in place worldwide and to reward those teams that achieve higher levels of colleague engagement, guest satisfaction, and hotel financial performance. 
Our reputation is a reflection of how we conduct ourselves and our business in the communities in which we live and work. One of our principal tools to enhance Hyatt's reputation is Hyatt Thrive, our global corporate responsibility program. Through Hyatt Thrive initiatives, we volunteer in our communities, support organizations that work in our communities, and work to reduce our waste and carbon footprint to make the communities in which we operate places where we want to live, where guests want to visit, and where our owners want to invest.
6

Drive Guest and Customer Personalization 
We aim to foster direct relationships with our guests by engaging with them in more direct ways, such as direct booking, communication, digital engagement, and on-property interactions. We continuously strive to uncover new opportunities for personalizing the guest experience in each of our brands. Truly understanding our guests informs everything we do, from the way we design our properties to the way we cultivate our food and beverage offerings.
We develop loyalty by fostering personal relationships and creating emotional connections that inspire brand preference. We believe true loyalty is built by deep interpersonal connections, authenticity, care, and trust. In 2017, we launched World of Hyatt to continue celebrating members, build community, and engage with high-end travelers. We have since enhanced, and intend to continue to enhance, the program over time. The World of Hyatt loyalty program is designed to attract new guests, demonstrate loyalty to our existing guests, and build long lasting and meaningful relationships with guests. In addition, Hyatt's co-branded Visa credit cards with Chase Bank USA, N.A. increase the frequency and relevancy of member engagement with World of Hyatt.
Operate with Excellence
A key component of our strategy is to maximize revenues and manage costs at our managed hotel properties. We strive to optimize revenues by focusing on revenue management and establishing and increasing guest loyalty to our brands. We work to expand Hyatt's share of rooms revenues by continuously striving to provide genuine guest service and delivering value to our guests. Our existing customer base is diverse with different needs and preferences. We aim to provide differentiated service and product offerings targeted at each customer segment within each of our brands, including meeting planners and group business, leisure guests, and business travelers, in order to satisfy our customers' specific needs.
We manage costs by setting performance goals for our hotel management teams, optimizing distribution channels, and granting our general managers operational autonomy. We support these cost management efforts by providing our general managers with tools and analytics from our regional and corporate offices and by compensating our hotel management teams based on property performance. In addition to managing hotel level costs, we strive to keep corporate costs aligned with growth through efficient resource allocation, which we expect will generate savings supporting our ability to fund additional growth and further invest in our brands.
Grow With Intent
We are focused on creating long-term shareholder value and on where and how we invest to expand our presence in key locations. We believe the scale of our presence around the world is small relative to the recognition of our brands and our excellent reputation for service and, therefore, we have a unique opportunity to grow. 

o | Increase Market Presence. We focus our expansion efforts on under-penetrated markets where we already have an established presence and on locations where our guests are traveling, but where we do not have a presence. We intend to expand our presence by increasing the number of hotels in the Hyatt portfolio, primarily by entering into new management and franchise agreements. We believe our intense focus on each customer group that we serve and our understanding of how we can serve them in new locations will result in quality growth. Over the past few years, we have made significant progress in expanding our presence through development of new hotels, conversion of existing hotels, and most recently, the acquisition of Two Roads. Additionally, we are focused on continued growth of our development pipeline. We have expanded our pipeline by an average of over 12% per year since the time of our IPO in 2009. Since 2009, we have also entered 246 new markets and 19 new countries. Expansion in dynamic markets like Greater China and India is central to our growth strategy as representation in key cities and resort destinations provides us with the opportunity to drive preference for our brands as we serve a broader base of guests in these high growth and under-penetrated markets. At December 31, 2018, there were over 170 hotels open or under development in Greater China in markets such as Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. In India, there were over 60 hotels open or under development at December 31, 2018. In addition to Greater China and India, we have also announced further expansion plans into diverse international markets including Albania, Canada, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, and Vietnam. 


o | Expand Select Service Presence. We continue to expand the Hyatt Place and Hyatt House brands, which we believe will support our overall growth and enhance the performance of all of our brands. We intend to grow our select service presence through third-party construction of new franchised properties, conversion and renovation of existing non-Hyatt properties, and in limited cases, support of the development of new managed properties. We believe the opportunity for properties providing a select offering of services at a 

7

lower price point than full service hotels is particularly compelling in certain markets, including Greater China, India, and the Middle East, where there is a large and growing middle class along with a meaningful number of local business travelers. At December 31, 2018, we had 46 Hyatt Place hotels and 10 Hyatt House hotels operating outside of the United States in 19 and 6 countries, respectively, throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. In addition to these hotels, we have announced new management agreements for select service properties currently under development in Bangladesh, France, Kenya, and Poland.

o | Increase Focus on Franchising. We continue to increase our franchised hotel presence, primarily in the United States. By increasing our focus on franchising, we believe we will gain access to capital from developers and property owners who are specifically targeting franchise business opportunities. We have an internal team dedicated to supporting our franchise owners and to driving the expansion of our franchised hotel presence. We plan to expand existing relationships and develop new relationships with franchisees who demonstrate an ability to provide excellent customer service and maintain our brand standards. In support of our strategy, over the past several years, we sold a number of individual full service hotels and portfolios of select service hotels subject to long-term franchise agreements with the purchasers. 


o | Utilize Our Capital and Asset Base for Targeted Growth. The combination of our significant liquidity and strong capital position coupled with our high quality asset base provides a unique platform to support our growth strategy. We take a comprehensive approach to our efforts to dispose of or recycle certain hotel real estate assets and to manage capital deployment in furtherance of our expansion plans. Capital deployment will continue with an objective to maximize long-term shareholder value, and we will assess and balance liquidity, value, and strategic importance in each instance. We will continue to commit capital to fund the renovation of certain assets and expect to maintain some level of hotel ownership over time in our owned portfolio. In November 2017, we committed to supplement our asset recycling strategy with a targeted reduction in our owned real estate portfolio expected to generate approximately $1.5 billion in gross cash proceeds by the end of 2020. To date, we have realized gross proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion. The proceeds are being used to unlock shareholder value, provide funds for growth investments, return capital to shareholders, and accelerate the evolution of our earnings profile to be less capital intensive. These dispositions are in addition to the execution of our asset recycling strategy—selling certain hotels while maintaining presence in those markets by entering into new management or franchise agreements with the buyer, and re-investing the sale proceeds into new hotels and other growth opportunities, including investments in hospitality ventures. Our asset recycling strategy has allowed us to grow and build our brands while improving the quality of our owned portfolio over time. 


o | Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances. We evaluate potential acquisitions of other brands or hospitality management or franchising companies as a part of our efforts to expand our global presence. In certain situations, these acquisitions may include hotel real estate. We focus on acquisitions that complement our ability to serve our existing customer base and enhance customer preference by providing a greater selection of locations, properties, and services. Furthermore, we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties to strengthen our brand presence. In the third quarter of 2018, we announced a strategic alliance with Small Luxury Hotels ("SLH"), and in the fourth quarter 2018, we added 54 SLH hotels to the World of Hyatt loyalty program with the expectation that additional SLH hotels will be added over time. This strategic alliance significantly enriches the benefits provided to members of the World of Hyatt loyalty program by providing additional stay opportunities at luxury quality hotels in many key markets which currently do not have a significant Hyatt presence (predominantly in Europe). In November 2018, we completed the acquisition of Two Roads for a purchase price of $405 million with additional variable consideration not to exceed $96 million. Proceeds from our $1.5 billion asset sell-down were utilized to fund the acquisition. As of December 31, 2018, the acquisition of Two Roads added 65 hotel properties or approximately 12,000 rooms and 10 condominium ownership properties comprising approximately 1,500 units, to our portfolio, and a pipeline of approximately 5,000 rooms, and the addition of five new brands. 


o | Extend Health and Wellness Offerings. Through the integration of Miraval and Exhale into the Hyatt portfolio, we continue our commitment to a holistic health and wellness strategy as an extension of our purpose and an important part of our growth strategy. Miraval and Exhale provide an opportunity to build a greater depth of expertise in wellness and mindfulness that can be extended to our hotel business, as well as an opportunity to increase guest loyalty.

Management Agreements 
We manage hotels and branded spas and fitness studios worldwide pursuant to management agreements. 
Hotel Management Agreements Fees 
Our hotel management agreements typically provide for a two-tiered fee structure that compensates us both for the volume of business we generate for the property as well as for the profitability of hotel operations. In these two-tier fee structures, our base compensation is a base fee that is usually an agreed-upon percentage of gross revenues from hotel operations. In addition, we are incentivized to improve hotel profitability through an incentive fee that is typically calculated as a percentage of a hotel profitability measure, such as gross operating profit, adjusted profit, or the amount by which gross operating profit or adjusted profit exceeds a specified threshold. Outside of the United States, our fees are often more dependent on hotel profitability measures either through a single management fee structure where the entire fee is based on a profitability measure, or because our two-tier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee. 
Hotel Management Agreements Terms and Renewals 
The approximate average remaining term of our hotel management agreements with third-party owners and unconsolidated hospitality ventures for full service hotels and select service hotels (other than those currently under development) is as follows:

 | Assuming no renewal options are exercised by either party: | Including exercise of extension options that are in Hyatt's sole discretion:
Full service management agreements: | | 
Americas | 13 years | 17 years 
EAME/SW Asia | 15 years | 20 years 
ASPAC | 13 years | 14 years 
Select service management agreements: | | 
Americas | 12 years | 28 years 
EAME/SW Asia | 21 years | 32 years 
ASPAC | 19 years | 21 years 

Some of our hotel management agreements grant early termination rights to hotel owners upon the occurrence of a stated event, such as the sale of the hotel or our failure to meet a specified performance test (any such event a "termination event"). In the case of a termination event, some of our management agreements grant hotel owners the right to terminate the hotel management agreement and convert the hotel to a Hyatt franchise. Generally, termination rights under performance tests are based upon the property's individual performance or its performance when compared to a specified set of competitive hotels branded by other hotel operators or both. These termination rights are usually triggered if we do not meet the performance tests over multiple years. We generally have the option to cure performance failures by paying an amount equal to the shortfall, but in some cases our cure rights may be limited, and our failure to meet a performance test may result in the termination of our hotel management agreement. Some of our management agreements allow for a termination right after a multi-year lock-out period and are subject to a termination fee generally based upon a formula related to the lost fees.
Many of our hotel management agreements, particularly in the United States, are subordinated to mortgages or other secured indebtedness of the owners. In most cases, our subordination agreements with lenders recognize our right to continue to manage the hotels under the terms set forth in the hotel management agreements if the lenders take possession of the hotel property through foreclosure or similar means.
Spa and Fitness Studio Management Agreements Fees
We manage spas and fitness centers under the Exhale brand pursuant to management agreements and leases. The management agreements generally provide for a base fee, which is typically either a fixed amount or an amount tied to a percentage of revenue at the facility.  Some of Exhale's management agreements also provide for a two-tiered fee structure, featuring both a base fee as well as an incentive fee. The incentive fees are typically tied to a percentage of a specified revenue or profitability measure, such as adjusted profit or revenue generated from spa packages at certain facilities. The leases generally provide for monthly rental payments to the landlord, along with additional charges in certain cases for items such as 
14

common area maintenance fees. In certain leases, we also pay to the landlord a percentage of gross sales of services or products in the leased premises.
Spa and Fitness Studio Management Agreements Terms and Renewals
The approximate average remaining term of our management agreements with third-party owners for our spa and fitness center facilities (other than those currently under development) is two years (assuming no renewal options are exercised by either party) or six years (including the exercise of extension options that are in Hyatt's sole discretion).
Franchise Agreements 
Our franchise agreements grant our franchisees the limited right to use our name, marks, and system in the operation of franchised Hyatt Regency, Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Centric, Hyatt Place, Hyatt House, Hyatt Ziva, and Hyatt Zilara properties, and franchised properties operated under distinct tradenames and affiliated with "The Unbound Collection by Hyatt". We do not participate in the management of our franchised hotels; however, franchisees are required to operate franchised hotels consistent with our brand standards. We approve the plans for, and the location of, franchised hotels and review the operation of these hotels to ensure our standards are maintained. 
Fees 
In general, our franchisees pay us an initial application fee and/or technical services fees and ongoing royalty fees, the amount of which depends on whether the franchised property is a select service hotel or full service hotel. We franchise full service hotels under the Hyatt Regency, Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Centric, and Hyatt brands, all-inclusive resorts under the Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara brands, and full service hotels under distinct tradenames and affiliated with "The Unbound Collection by Hyatt". We franchise select service hotels under the Hyatt Place and Hyatt House brands. Application fees are typically $75,000 plus $500 per guest room in excess of 150, for our Hyatt Place and our Hyatt House hotels and the greater of $100,000 or $400 per guest room for our full service hotels and all-inclusive resorts. Select service franchisees pay continuing franchise fees calculated as a percentage of gross room revenues, which typically are 3% in the first year of operations, 4% in the second year, and 5% through the remainder of the term. Our Hyatt Regency and Hyatt franchisees typically pay us franchise fees calculated as 6% of gross room revenues and 3% of gross food and beverage revenues. Our Hyatt Centric franchisees typically pay us franchise fees calculated as 5% of gross room revenues. The Unbound Collection by Hyatt franchisees typically pay us franchise fees calculated as 7% of gross room revenues generated through Hyatt reservation and booking channels. Our all-inclusive franchisees typically pay us franchise fees calculated as either 2.75% or 3.25% of gross revenues. In some circumstances, we have negotiated other fee arrangements, and in some regions outside of the United States, we typically negotiate alternative application fee arrangements.
In addition to our franchise fees, we charge full service hotel and all-inclusive resort franchisees for certain services arranged and, in most cases, provided by us. These activities include centralized reservation functions, certain sales functions, technology, national advertising, certain marketing and promotional services, as well as various revenue management services. We charge select service franchisees for marketing, central reservations, and technology services arranged and, in most cases, provided by us. 
Terms and Renewals 
The standard term of our franchise agreements is typically 20 years, with one 10 year renewal option exercisable by the franchisee, assuming the franchisee has complied with franchise agreement requirements and standards. Certain of our franchise agreements have renewal options at Hyatt's option, generally triggered if the franchisee has failed to exercise its renewal option. We have the right to terminate franchise agreements upon specified events of default, including non-payment of fees and non-compliance with brand standards. In the event of early termination for any reason, our franchise agreements set forth liquidated damages our franchisees must pay to us upon termination. The bankruptcy of a franchisee or lender foreclosure could result in the termination of the franchise agreement. The average remaining base term of our franchise agreements for our select service and full service hotels in all regions (other than those currently under development) is approximately 16 years, assuming no renewal options are exercised by either party. Including exercise of extension options in Hyatt's discretion, the average remaining term of our franchise agreements for our select service hotels and full service hotels in all regions (other than those currently under development) is approximately 18 years. 
15

Other Service Agreements 
We provide services under the Destination Residential Management business pursuant to agreements with individual property owners or homeowner's associations whereby the property owners and/or homeowner's association participate in our rental program. The agreements typically provide for our receipt of a percentage split of the total gross revenue generated from a property under the rental program and expenses of the property are paid from such split. The agreement terms are typically one or two years. 
Sales, Marketing, and Reservations
Sales 
We deploy a global sales team as well as regional sales teams in our Americas, ASPAC, and EAME/SW Asia regions. The global team is responsible for our largest and most significant accounts doing business in all three regions. The regional teams are responsible for large accounts that typically do business within one region, but at multiple hotels within the region. The global and regional sales teams coordinate efforts with the hotel sales teams. The in-house sales colleagues are focused on local and regional business opportunities, as well as securing business generated from our key global and regional accounts. 
Our corporate sales organizations are focused on growing market share with key accounts, identifying new business opportunities, and maximizing our local customer base. Our key accounts consist of major corporations; national, state, and regional associations; specialty market accounts (social, government, military, educational, religious, and fraternal); travel agency and luxury organizations; and a broad and diverse group of individual consumers. Our global and regional sales teams target multiple brands to key customer accounts within these groups. No single customer is material to our business. Our global and regional teams consist of over 200 colleagues at global and regional sales offices around the world, who are focused on group business, corporate and leisure traveler accounts, and travel agencies. 
Sales colleagues at our regional offices and at many of our full service hotels use our proprietary sales tool to manage the group rooms forecast, maintain an inventory of definite and tentative group rooms booked each day, streamline the process of checking guest room availability and rate quotes, and determine meeting room availability. 
We seek to maximize revenues in each hotel we operate through a team of revenue management professionals and also provide revenue management services to franchisees upon request. Our revenue management leaders use a proprietary technology tool to help set appropriate pricing in each hotel. The goal of revenue management is to secure the right customers, on the right date, at the right price. Business opportunities are reviewed and agreed upon by the hotel's management team.
Marketing
We are focused on the high-end traveler, positioning our brands at the top of each segment in which we operate. Our marketing strategy is designed to drive loyalty and community, while meeting the specific business needs of hotel operations. Building and differentiating each of our brands are critical to increasing Hyatt's brand preference. We are focused on targeting the distinct guest segments that each of our brands serves and supporting the needs of the hotels by thorough analysis and application of data and analytics. The World of Hyatt loyalty program and Hyatt.com are also key components of building loyalty and driving revenue. The loyalty program focuses on deepening relationships with members, driving repeat stays, guest satisfaction, recognition, and differential services and experiences for our most loyal guests. Hyatt.com is our primary online distribution channel providing customers with an efficient source of information about our hotels and an effective booking experience. With a combined focus on increasing brand awareness, building a community of loyalists, and enhancing digital engagement, our marketing is aimed at Hyatt becoming the most preferred hospitality brand.
Reservations 
We have a central reservation system that provides a comprehensive view of inventory, while allowing for local management of rates based on demand. Through this system, we are able to allow bookings by hotels directly, via telephone and correspondence through our contact centers, by travel agents, by corporate clients, and online through Hyatt.com. 
We have nine global contact centers that service our global guest base 24 hours per day, seven days per week and provide reservation services in over 18 languages. While we continue to provide full reservation services via telephone through our global contact centers, we have made significant investments in internet booking capabilities on Hyatt.com web and mobile platforms. 
In addition, some of the rooms at hotels and resorts we manage or franchise are booked through internet travel intermediaries, partners, or online travel service providers. We also engage third-party intermediaries who collect fees by 
16

charging our hotels and resorts a commission on room revenues, including travel agencies and meeting and event management companies. 
World of Hyatt Loyalty Program
We operate the World of Hyatt loyalty program which generates substantial repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points that can be used towards redeeming for hotel nights and other rewards. Inspired by our purpose, World of Hyatt is also about building community and engagement with high-end travelers. Loyalty program members enjoy additional rewards as they advance through the three elite tiers based on qualifying nights or base points in a calendar year.
Members earn points based on their spend at our properties or in connection with spend on the Hyatt co-branded credit cards. Loyalty program points can be redeemed at properties across the majority of our brands, converted into airline miles with numerous participating airlines, and redeemed with other third parties. 
The loyalty program is primarily funded through contributions from eligible revenues generated from loyalty program members. These funds are applied to reimburse hotels for room nights when members redeem loyalty program points and pay for administrative expenses and marketing initiatives to support the loyalty program. 
At December 31, 2018, the loyalty program had over 16 million members, and during 2018, represented approximately 38% of total room nights system wide. Beginning in 2018, the loyalty program includes all stays during which a member earns World of Hyatt points (or benefits from a third party loyalty program, such as airline miles, in lieu of points) in the percent of total room nights contributed by the loyalty program. If the aforementioned methodology changes would have been used in 2017, the loyalty program would have represented approximately 35% of total room nights systemwide in 2017.
Competition 
There is intense competition in all areas of the hospitality industry. Competition exists for hotel guests, management and franchise agreements, and sales of vacation ownership properties and branded residential properties. Our principal competitors are other operators of full service, select service, all-inclusive, wellness, and extended stay properties, including other major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. We also compete against small chains and independent and local owners and operators. Increasingly, we also face competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model, such as Alibaba, search engines such as Google, and peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms, such as Airbnb and HomeAway.
We compete for guests based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, location, customer satisfaction, room rates, quality of service, amenities, quality of accommodations, security, and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. 
We compete for management agreements based primarily on the value and quality of our management services, our brand name recognition and reputation, the level of our management fees, the costs of our system-wide services, and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brand name. We compete for franchise agreements based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, the room rate that can be realized, and total revenues we can deliver to the properties. Other competitive factors for management and franchise agreements include relationships with property owners and investors, including institutional owners of multiple properties, marketing support, reservation and e-commerce system capacity and efficiency, and the ability to make investments that may be necessary to obtain management and franchise agreements. 
The number of branded lodging operators with a global reach and depth of product and offerings similar to us is limited. We believe our strong customer base, prominent brand recognition, strategic property locations, and global development team enable us to compete effectively. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our revenues, profits, or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively, and new distribution channels, alternatives to traditional hotels, and industry consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business." 
Seasonality 
The hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. The periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location, the customer base served, and potential impacts due to the timing of certain holidays. 
17

Cyclicality 
The hospitality industry is cyclical and generally follows, on a lagged basis, the overall economy. There is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms, in occupancy levels, and in rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles. Variability of results through some of the cycles in the past has been more severe due to changes in the supply of hotel rooms in given markets or in given categories of hotels. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners, managers, and franchisors of hotel properties. The costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable. Because of this, in an environment of declining revenues, the rate of decline in earnings will be higher than the rate of decline in revenues. Conversely, in an environment of increasing demand and room rates, the rate of increase in earnings is typically higher than the rate of increase in revenues. 
Intellectual Property
In the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos are very important in the sales and marketing of our hotels, residential, and vacation ownership properties and services. We have a significant number of trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, and pending registrations and significant resources are expended each year on surveillance, registration, and protection of our trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos, which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and care. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Any failure to protect our trademarks and intellectual property could reduce the value of our brand names and harm our business."
Government Regulation
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages, building and zoning requirements, data privacy, and general business license and permit requirements, in the various jurisdictions in which we manage, franchise, license, and own properties. Our ability to develop new hotel properties and to remodel, refurbish, or add to existing properties is also dependent on obtaining permits from local authorities. We are also subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, hiring and firing, non-discrimination for disabilities and other individual characteristics, work permits, and benefit offerings. Federal, state, and provincial laws and regulations require certain registration, disclosure statements, compliance with specific standards of conduct, and other practices with respect to the franchising of hotels. Compliance with these various laws and regulations can affect the revenues and profits of properties managed, franchised, licensed, or owned, and of the vacation ownership business and could adversely affect our operations. We believe our businesses are conducted in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
We manage and own hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels. However, with the exception of Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort Spa and Casino, third parties manage and operate the casinos. We hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casino located at Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort Spa and Casino and employ third-party compliance consultants and service providers. As a result, our business operations at Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort Spa and Casino are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Departamento pa Asuntonan di Casino (D.A.C.), the regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in Aruba. 
Employees
At December 31, 2018, approximately 20% of our approximately 54,000 employees (approximately 22% of our U.S.-based employees) were either represented by a labor union or had terms of employment that were determined under a labor agreement. We believe relations with our employees and colleagues are good. 
Environmental Matters
In connection with our ownership, management, and development of properties, we are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under some of these laws, a current or former owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of investigating or remediating hazardous or toxic substances or wastes on, under or in such real property, as well as third-party sites where the owner or operator sent wastes for disposal. Such laws may impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew, or was at fault in connection with, the presence or release of such hazardous substances or wastes. Although we are not aware of any current material obligations for investigating or remediating hazardous substances or wastes at our owned properties, the future discovery of substances or wastes at any of our owned properties, or the failure to remediate such contaminated property properly, could adversely affect our ability to develop or sell such real estate, or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In addition, the costs of investigating or remediating contamination at our properties or at properties where we sent substances or wastes for disposal, may be substantial. 
18

We are also subject to various requirements, including those contained in environmental permits required for our operations, governing air emissions, effluent discharges, the use, management, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and health and safety. From time to time, we may be required to manage, abate, or remove mold, lead, or asbestos-containing materials at our properties. We believe our properties and operations are in compliance, in all material respects, with all foreign, federal, state, and local environmental laws and ordinances. However, additional operating costs and capital expenditures could be incurred if additional or more stringent requirements are enacted in the future. 
Insurance
Properties that the Company owns outright or through hospitality ventures, manages, franchises, and licenses are insured under different insurance programs depending on whether the property participates in our insurance programs or in the insurance programs of the property owner (including hospitality ventures), franchisee, or licensee. We maintain insurance coverage for hotels owned by the Company under our insurance programs for liability, property, workers compensation, and other risks with respect to our business. Our liability insurance provides coverage for most claims, including terrorism, resulting from our operations, goods and services, and automobiles. Our property insurance provides coverage for all risks to our properties including fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake, and terrorism. Property insurance also includes business interruption coverage. Our workers compensation insurance provides coverage for employee injuries in the course and scope of employment. Hotels owned by hospitality ventures or hotels managed by the Company are permitted to participate in our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hospitality venture partners or third-party hotel owners. The majority of hotels owned by hospitality ventures and managed hotels owned by third parties participate in our insurance programs. Our hospitality venture agreements and management agreements require hotels owned by hospitality ventures and managed hotels owned by third parties that do not participate in our insurance programs to be insured at coverage levels generally consistent with the coverage levels under our insurance programs, including liability, property, business interruption, workers compensation, and other insurance. Our franchise and license agreements require our franchisees and licensees to maintain liability, property, business interruption, workers compensation, and other insurance at our franchised or licensed properties. We are typically covered under insurance policies held by third-party property owners, franchisees, or licensees to the extent necessary and reasonable. We also maintain cyber-risk insurance for systems and data controlled by the Company. Cyber-risk insurance generally covers all Company-controlled systems and Company-controlled data in properties that the Company owns, outright or through hospitality ventures, manages, franchises, and licenses. We believe the Company's insurance policies, as well as those maintained by third-party owners, including hospitality ventures, are adequate for foreseeable losses and on terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary with solvent insurance carriers. We also self-insure some of our risks generally through the use of deductibles and retentions. We believe these deductibles and retentions are reasonable and customary for our industry and our size. We use U.S.-based and licensed captive insurance companies that are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company to generally insure our deductibles and retentions.

Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement 
The trustees of the U.S. situs trusts for the benefit of certain lineal descendants of Nicholas J. Pritzker, deceased, that own, directly or indirectly, shares of our common stock, and the adult beneficiaries of such trusts, including Mr. Thomas J. Pritzker, our executive chairman, and Mr. Jason Pritzker, one of our directors, and any of their successors that own, directly or indirectly, shares of our common stock, have entered into the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to, among other things, certain voting agreements and limitations on the sale of shares of our common stock. At January 31, 2019, Pritzker family business interests own, directly or indirectly, 64,900,938 shares, or 61.2%, of our total outstanding common stock and control approximately 91.3% of our total voting power. Specifically, such parties have agreed that until the date upon which more than 75% of the Company's fully diluted shares of common stock is owned by persons other than Pritzker family members and spouses (including any U.S. or non-U.S. situs trusts for the current or future, direct or indirect, vested or contingent, benefit of Pritzker family members and spouses), all Pritzkers (and their successors in interest, if applicable), but not the transferees by sale (other than Pritzkers who purchase directly from other Pritzkers), will vote all of their voting securities consistent with the recommendations of our board of directors with respect to all matters assuming agreement as to any such matter by a majority of a minimum of three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) or, in the case of transactions involving us and an affiliate, assuming agreement of all of such minimum of three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker). All Pritzkers have agreed to cast and submit by proxy to us their votes in a manner consistent with the foregoing voting agreement at least five business days prior to the scheduled date of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. 
In addition, such parties have agreed that until the date upon which more than 75% of the Company's fully diluted shares of common stock is owned by persons other than Pritzker family members and spouses (including any U.S. or non-U.S. situs trusts for the current or future, direct or indirect, vested or contingent, benefit of any Pritzker family members and spouses), all Pritzker family members and spouses (including U.S. and non-U.S. situs trusts for the current or future, direct or indirect, vested or contingent, benefit of any Pritzker family members and spouses or affiliates of any thereof) in a "beneficiary group" (including trusts only to the extent of the then current benefit of members of such beneficiary group) may sell up to 25% of their aggregate holdings of our common stock, measured as of November 4, 2009, the date of effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-161068) relating to our initial public offering of our Class A common stock, in each 12-month period following the date of effectiveness of such registration statement (without carry-overs), and shall not sell more than such amount during any such period. Upon the unanimous affirmative vote of our independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker), such 25% limitation may, with respect to each such 12 month period, be increased to a higher percentage or waived entirely. Sales of our common stock, including Class A common stock and Class B common stock, between and among Pritzkers is permitted without regard to the sale restrictions described above and such sales are not counted against the 25% sale limitation. 
All shares of our common stock owned by each beneficiary group (including trusts only to the extent of the then current benefit of members of such beneficiary group) are freely pledgeable to an institutional lender and such institutional lender will not be subject to the sale restrictions described above upon default and foreclosure. 
The Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement may be amended, modified, supplemented, or restated by the written agreement of the successors to Mr. Thomas J. Pritzker, Mr. Marshall E. Eisenberg, and Mr. Karl J. Breyer, solely in their capacity as co-trustees of the Pritzker family U.S. situs trusts, 75% of the adult beneficiaries named below and a majority of the other adult beneficiaries party to the agreement. Each of Thomas J. Pritzker, Nicholas J. Pritzker, Jennifer N. Pritzker, John A. Pritzker, Linda Pritzker, Karen L. Pritzker, Penny Pritzker, Daniel F. Pritzker, Anthony N. Pritzker, Gigi Pritzker Pucker, and Jay Robert Pritzker, and their respective lineal descendants and current spouse, if relevant, make up a "beneficiary group." 
Disputes that relate to the subject matter of the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement are subject to arbitration pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The exclusive requirement to arbitrate under the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement shall not apply with respect to the manner in which Hyatt's operations are conducted to the extent the parties (in their capacities as stockholders) and non-Pritzker public stockholders are affected comparably; provided, however, that a party may participate in and benefit from any shareholder litigation initiated by a non-party to the agreement. A party to the agreement may not solicit others to initiate or be a named plaintiff in such litigation (i) unless two thirds of the independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) of a board of directors having at least three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) do not vote in favor of the matter that is the subject of the litigation or (ii) in the case of affiliated transactions reviewed by our board of directors, unless at least one independent director (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) did not approve the transaction.

Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement 
The trustees of the non-U.S. situs trusts for the benefit of certain lineal descendants of Nicholas J. Pritzker, deceased, that own, directly or indirectly, shares of our common stock, and the adult beneficiaries of such trusts, including Mr. Thomas J. Pritzker and Mr. Jason Pritzker, and any of their successors that own, directly or indirectly, shares of our common stock, have entered into the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to, among other things, certain voting agreements and limitations on the sale of shares of our common stock. At January 31, 2019, Pritzker family business interests own, directly or indirectly, 64,900,938 shares, or 61.2%, of our total outstanding common stock and control approximately 91.3% of our total voting power. Specifically, such parties have agreed that until the date upon which more than 75% of the Company's fully diluted shares of common stock is owned by persons other than Pritzker family members and spouses (including any U.S. or non-U.S. situs trusts for the current or future, direct or indirect, vested or contingent, benefit of any Pritzker family members and spouses), all Pritzkers (and their successors in interest, if applicable), but not the transferees by sale (other than Pritzkers who purchase directly from other Pritzkers), will vote (or cause to be voted) all of the voting securities held directly or indirectly by them consistent with the recommendations of our board of directors with respect to all matters assuming agreement as to any such matter by a majority of a minimum of three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) or, in the case of transactions involving us and an affiliate, assuming agreement of all of such minimum of three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker). All Pritzkers have agreed to cast and submit by proxy to us their votes in a manner consistent with the foregoing voting agreement at least five business days prior to the scheduled date of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. 
In addition, such parties have agreed that until the date upon which more than 75% of the Company's fully diluted shares of common stock is owned by persons other than Pritzker family members and spouses (including any U.S. or non-U.S. situs trusts for the current or future, direct or indirect, vested or contingent, benefit of any Pritzker family members and spouses), all Pritzker family members and spouses (including U.S. and non-U.S. situs trusts for the current or future, direct or indirect, vested or contingent, benefit of any Pritzker family members and spouses and/or affiliates of any thereof) in a "beneficiary group" (including trusts only to the extent of the then current benefit of members of such beneficiary group) may sell up to 25% of their aggregate holdings of our common stock, measured as of November 4, 2009, the date of effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-161068) relating to our initial public offering of our Class A common stock, in each 12-month period following the date of effectiveness of such registration statement (without carry-overs), and shall not sell more than such amount during any such period. Upon the unanimous affirmative vote of our independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker), such 25% limitation may, with respect to each such 12 month period, be increased to a higher percentage or waived entirely. Sales of our common stock, including Class A common stock and Class B common stock, between and among Pritzkers is permitted without regard to the sale restrictions described above and such sales are not counted against the 25% sale limitation. 
All shares of our common stock owned directly or indirectly by each beneficiary group (including trusts only to the extent of the then current benefit of members of such beneficiary group) are freely pledgeable to an institutional lender and such institutional lender will not be subject to the sale restrictions described above upon default and foreclosure. 
The Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement may be amended, modified, supplemented, or restated by the written agreement of 75% of the adult beneficiaries named below and a majority of the other adult beneficiaries party to the agreement. Each of Thomas J. Pritzker, Nicholas J. Pritzker, Jennifer N. Pritzker, John A. Pritzker, Linda Pritzker, Karen L. Pritzker, Penny Pritzker, Daniel F. Pritzker, Anthony N. Pritzker, Gigi Pritzker Pucker, and Jay Robert Pritzker, and their respective lineal descendants and current spouse, if relevant, make up a "beneficiary group." 
Disputes that relate to the subject matter of the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement are subject to arbitration pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The exclusive requirement to arbitrate under the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement shall not apply with respect to the manner in which Hyatt's operations are conducted to the extent the parties (in their capacities as stockholders) and non-Pritzker public stockholders are affected comparably; provided, however, that a party may participate in and benefit from any shareholder litigation initiated by a non-party to the agreement. A party to the agreement may not solicit others to initiate or be a named plaintiff in such litigation (i) unless two thirds of the independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) of a board of directors having at least three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) do not vote in favor of the matter that is the subject of the litigation or (ii) in the case of affiliated transactions reviewed by our board of directors, unless at least one independent director (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) did not approve the transaction.

2007 Stockholders' Agreement 
In connection with the issuance and sale of 100,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to GS Sunray Holdings, L.L.C. ("GSSH") and GS Sunray Holdings Parallel, L.L.C. ("GSSHP" and collectively with GSSH, the "Goldman Sachs Funds"), affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co., and the execution of a Subscription Agreement in August 2007, we entered into the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement with Madrone GHC, LLC and affiliates (collectively, "Madrone"), the Goldman Sachs Funds, and an additional investor that provides for certain rights and obligations of these stockholders, as described below.
In May 2009, the shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Goldman Sachs Funds were converted into shares of common stock. Such shares of common stock, along with shares of common stock purchased by the Goldman Sachs Funds and Madrone in May 2009 pursuant to the Subscription Agreement and in the May 2009 private placement transaction, and any other shares of common stock held by the parties to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement prior to our initial public offering, were reclassified into shares of our Class B common stock upon the filing of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation on November 4, 2009, the date of our initial public offering. At January 31, 2019, the Goldman Sachs Funds and Madrone no longer held any shares of common stock subject to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement as a result of sales into the public market subject to applicable securities laws. At January 31, 2019, the additional investor party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement held 2,270,395 shares of Class B common stock. 
Transfer Restrictions 
No stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement may transfer (1) the legal or beneficial ownership of any common stock held by such stockholder unless such acquiring person's ownership of common stock is not reasonably likely to jeopardize any licensing from a governmental authority, as determined by our board of directors in its reasonable discretion, (2) any common stock to an aggregator (meaning a person who is required to file a Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act disclosing an interest other than for investment), (3) any common stock to a competitor of ours engaged in one or more of the hospitality, lodging, and/or gaming industries or (4) any common stock that would cause a stockholder to violate any provision of the agreement. Such restrictions are qualified by the "actual knowledge" of the transferring stockholder in the case of transfers pursuant to an underwritten public offering or a broad distribution sale. 
All other transfer restrictions set forth in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement expired in May 2015. However, all shares held by such stockholders remain subject to the rights of first refusal (except as described below with respect to shares held by Madrone) and "drag along" rights described below.
Right of First Refusal 
In the event that the number of shares of common stock proposed to be transferred by a stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement and its affiliates together with any shares of common stock then proposed to be transferred by the other stockholders party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement and their affiliates exceeds 2% of the then outstanding shares of common stock, then prior to consummating the sale of common stock to a third-party purchaser, such stockholder or stockholders shall offer to transfer the common stock to us at the applicable market value (as defined in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement). If we do not accept the offer within a specified period of time, such stockholder or stockholders may transfer the shares of common stock to the third-party purchaser as long as such transfer occurs within the time periods specified in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement and on terms and conditions no more favorable in the aggregate than those offered to us. We waived all rights of first refusal with respect to shares held by the Goldman Sachs Funds and Madrone in connection with the sales into the public market by such entities.
"Drag-Along" Right 
In connection with a "change of control" (as defined in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement) transaction, we have the right to require each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement to participate in such change of control transaction on the same terms, conditions, and price per share of common stock as those applicable to the other holders of our common stock. In addition, upon our request, the stockholders party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement have agreed to vote in favor of such change of control transaction or similar transaction, and we have the right to require each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement to vote for, consent to, and raise no objection to any such transaction. 
"Tag-Along" Right 
Subject to the fiduciary duties of our board of directors, we have agreed that we will not agree to consummate a change of control transaction with respect to which the stockholders party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement are not given the right to participate on the same terms, conditions, and price per share of common stock as those applicable to the other holders of our common stock. 
22

Preemptive Rights 
Each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement has the right to purchase such stockholder's pro rata share of any new shares of common stock, or any other equity securities, that we may propose to sell and issue on comparable terms by making an election within the time periods specified in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement, subject to certain excluded securities issuances described in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement, including shares issued pursuant to equity compensation plans adopted by our board of directors and the issuance of shares of our common stock in a public offering. If not all stockholders elect to purchase their full preemptive allocation of new securities, then we will notify the fully-participating stockholders and offer them the right to purchase the unsubscribed new securities. 
Voting Agreement 
Until the date that Mr. Thomas J. Pritzker is no longer our chairman, each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement has agreed to vote all of their shares of common stock consistent with the recommendations of a majority of our board of directors with respect to all matters. At January 31, 2019, the stockholders party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement own in the aggregate 2,270,395 shares of Class B common stock or approximately 3.4% of our Class B common stock, approximately 2.1% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock and approximately 3.2% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock. 
Standstill 
Under the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement, each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement agreed that, subject to certain limited exceptions, so long as such stockholder owns shares of common stock, neither such stockholder nor any of its related persons will in any manner, directly or indirectly: 

• | effect or seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or announce any intention to effect or cause or participate in or in any way assist, facilitate, or encourage any other person to effect or seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in, (a) any acquisition of any of our or our subsidiaries' securities (or beneficial ownership thereof) (except through the proper exercise of preemptive rights granted under the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement), or rights or options to acquire any of our or our subsidiaries' securities (or beneficial ownership thereof), or any of our or our subsidiaries' or affiliates' assets, indebtedness, or businesses, (b) any tender or exchange offer, merger, or other business combination involving us or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates or any assets constituting a significant portion of our consolidated assets, (c) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution, or other extraordinary transaction with respect to us or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates, or (d) any "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the proxy rules under the Exchange Act) or written consents with respect to any of our or our affiliates' voting securities. For this purpose, the term "affiliates" means our affiliates primarily engaged in the hospitality, lodging, and/or gaming industries;


• | form, join, or in any way participate in a "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with respect to us where such group seeks to acquire any of our equity securities;


• | otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek representation on or to control or influence our or our subsidiaries' management, board of directors, or policies;


• | take any action which would or would reasonably be expected to force us to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in the first bullet point above;


• | own more than 12% of the issued and outstanding common stock, unless such ownership arises as a result of any action not taken by or on behalf of such stockholder or a related person of such stockholder; or


• | request that we or any of our representatives, directly or indirectly, amend or waive any of the foregoing provisions.

Each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement has also agreed that, if at any time during the period such stockholder is subject to the foregoing provisions, such stockholder is approached by any third party concerning its participation in any transaction or proposed transaction involving the acquisition of all or any portion of the assets, indebtedness, or securities of, or any business of, ours or any of our subsidiaries, such stockholder will promptly inform us of the nature of such transaction and the parties involved. 
Termination 
The 2007 Stockholders' Agreement terminates (1) with respect to any individual stockholder, on the first date when such stockholder no longer holds any shares of common stock and (2) in its entirety, upon the first to occur of all of our equity 
23

securities being owned by a single person or the agreement in writing by us and each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement.
