Item 1     Description of Business
 
Royale Energy, Inc. (“Royale” or the “Company”) is an independent oil and natural gas producer incorporated under the laws of Delaware.  Royale’s principal lines of business are the production and sale of oil and natural gas, acquisition of oil and gas lease interests and proved reserves, drilling of both exploratory and development wells, and sales of fractional working interests in wells to be drilled by Royale.  Royale was incorporated in Delaware in 2017.   On December 31, 2018, Royale and its consolidated subsidiaries had 11 full time employees.
 
Merger with Matrix Oil Management Corporation
 
On March 7, 2018, Royale Energy, Inc. (“Royale”), Royale Energy Funds, Inc. (“REF”), and Matrix Oil Management Corporation (“Matrix”) and its affiliates were notified by the California Secretary of State of the filing and acceptance of agreements of merger by the California Secretary of State, to complete the previously announced merger between the companies (the “Merger”).  In the Merger, REF was merged into a newly formed subsidiary of Royale, and Matrix was merged into a second newly formed subsidiary of Royale pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger among REF, Royale, Royale Merger Sub, Inc., (“Royale Merger Sub”), Matrix Merger Sub, Inc., (“Matrix Merger Sub”) and Matrix (the “Merger Agreement”).  Additionally, in connection with the merger, all limited partnership interest of two limited partnership affiliates of Matrix (Matrix Permian Investments, LP, and Matrix Las Cienegas Limited Partnership), were exchanged for Royale common stock using conversion ratios according to the relative values of each partnership.  All Class A limited partnership interests of another Matrix affiliate, Matrix Investments, LP (“Matrix Investments”) were exchanged for Royale Common stock using conversion ratios according to the relative value of the Class A limited partnership interests, and $20,124,000 of Matrix Investments preferred limited partnership interests were converted into 2,012,400 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of Royale.  Another Matrix affiliate, Matrix Oil Corporation (“Matrix Operator”), was acquired by Royale by exchanging Royale common stock for the outstanding common stock of Matrix Oil Corporation using a conversion ratio according to the relative value of the Matrix Oil Corporation common stock.  Matrix, Matrix Oil Corporation and the three limited partnership affiliates of Matrix called the “Matrix Entities.”
 
The Merger had been previously approved by the respective holders of all outstanding capital stock of REF, Matrix, Royale, Matrix Merger Sub and Royale Merger Sub on November 16, 2017, as previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 16, 2017.  The Merger and related transactions are described in detail in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 7, 2018, and in Royale’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 7, 2018 (SEC File No. 000-55912).
 
As a result of the Merger, REF became a wholly owned subsidiary of Royale, and each outstanding share common stock of REF at the time of the Merger was converted into one share of common stock of Royale.  The common stock of Royale is traded on the Over-The-Counter QB (OTCQB) Market System (symbol ROYL).
 
Joint Venture with RMX Resources, LLC
 
On April 4, 2018, RMX Resources, LLC (“RMX”), CIC RMX LP (“CIC”), and Royale, REF, and Matrix, entered into a Subscription and Contribution Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) and certain other agreements contemplated therein (the “Transaction”).  The Contribution Agreement provided that Royale, REF and Matrix would contribute certain assets to RMX Resources, LLC (“RMX”), a newly formed Texas limited liability company. In exchange for its contributed assets, Royale received a 20% equity interest in RMX, an equity performance incentive interest and $20.0 million to satisfy Matrix’s current senior lender, Arena Limited SPV, LLC, in full, and to pay REF, Matrix and Royale’s trade payables and other outstanding obligations.  CIC contributed an aggregate of $25.0 million in cash to RMX in exchange for (i) an 80% equity interest in RMX, with preferred distributions until certain thresholds are met, (ii) a warrant (“Warrant”) to acquire up to 4,000,000 shares of Royale’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share and registration rights pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement (“Registration Rights Agreement”).
 
The assets contributed by Royale and its subsidiaries included (i) all of their respective oil and gas properties located in the State of California other than certain excluded assets (the “Excluded Assets”), (ii), the right to acquire the 50% non-operated working interest in oil and gas leases in the Sansinena and East Los Angeles fields (“Sunny Frog Acquisition Agreement”) operated by Matrix Oil Corporation (“Matrix Operator”) and (iii) all of the stock of Matrix Operator.  The Excluded Assets include (i) 50% of Matrix’s working interest ownership in a) the City of Whittier, b) Bellevue and (ii) 100% of Matrix’s working interest in the East LA Field, the oil and gas leasehold interest, equipment and properties owned by Royale prior to February 1, 2018, and business equipment and other personal property held by Matrix Operator.

The Contribution Agreement contemplated a two-step closing and funding, with the First Closing consummated on April 4, 2018 and the Second Closing to occur by April 13, 2018.
 
Immediately upon execution of the Contribution Agreement and consummation of the First Closing, RMX purchased the 50% non-operated working interest in oil and gas leases in the Sansinena and East Los Angeles fields pursuant to the Sunny Frog Acquisition Agreement for approximately $15 million, pursuant to the Sunny Frog Acquisition Agreement, as amended.
 
As a requirement of the Contribution Agreement, Jonathan Gregory, the Chief Executive Officer of Royale, also became CEO of RMX.  Mr. Gregory entered into an employment agreement (the “Gregory Employment Agreement”) with Royale and separately with RMX.  RMX acquired Matrix Operator and its employees in order to continue the current development efforts on the property being acquired by RMX. Under the terms of a management services agreement (the “Management Services Agreement”), required by the Contribution Agreement, Royale provided RMX with its required accounting, financial reporting and analysis and regulatory support services for a payment of $180,000 per month for the first twelve months, and a fee of $150,000 per month thereafter.
 
On April 13, 2018, the parties consummated the second part of the Contribution Agreement and Transaction.  In connection with this second closing, the parties entered into a letter agreement related to the preliminary Settlement Statement process.  The parties agreed that, in lieu of the payment originally contemplated under Section 1.6(v) of the Contribution Agreement, the Royale Parties would receive the sum of $4,000,000, subject to adjustment. The $4,000,000 delivered at the Second Closing was an advance against amounts due the Royale Parties as Purchase Price, and the advance was subject to further adjustment in accordance with the Contribution Agreement.  In addition, the Royale Parties acknowledged that RMX and CIC retained all rights to pursue any claims for indemnification that may arise from breaches with respect to the matters described therein.
 
In this Annual Report, “Royale” and the “Company” refer to Royale Energy, Inc., the Delaware corporation. Financial information for 2018 is reported for Royale on a consolidated basis including the following subsidiaries:

Financial information, including the financial statements as of December 31, 2017, is reported for REF unless reference is specifically made to financial information for one or more of the Matrix Entities prior to the merger. Prior to 2018, REF was registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and filed reports under Royale Energy Funds, Inc., SEC File No. 0-22750.
Royale Energy, Inc.
 
Royale and its subsidiaries own wells and leases located mainly in the Sacramento Basin and San Joaquin Basin in California as well as in Utah, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.  Royale usually sells a portion of the working interest in each well it drills or participates in to third party investors and retains a portion of the prospect for its own account.  Selling part of the working interest to others allows Royale to reduce its drilling risk by owning a diversified inventory of properties with less of its own funds invested in each drilling prospect, than if Royale owned all the working interest and paid all drilling and development costs of each prospect itself.  Royale generally sells working interests in its prospects to accredited investors in exempt securities offerings.  The prospects are bundled into multi-well investments, which permit the third party investors to diversify their investments by investing in several wells at once instead of investing in single well prospects.
 


1Royale DWI Investors, LLC, is a California limited liability company formed in 2017 to hold legal title to certain oil and gas working interests which Royale owns for the benefit of its working interest investors.

During its fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, Royale continued to explore and develop natural gas properties with a concentration in California.  Additionally, we own proved developed producing and non-producing reserves of oil and natural gas in Utah, Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, as well as holding an overriding royalty interest in a discovery in Alaska.  In 2018, Royale drilled four natural gas wells in northern California, two of which were commercially productive.  Royale’s estimated total reserves were approximately 9.9 and 2.1 BCFE (billion cubic feet equivalent) at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  According to the reserve reports furnished by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., Royale’s independent petroleum engineers, the undiscounted net reserve value of its proved developed and undeveloped reserves was approximately $57.8 million at December 31, 2018, based on the average West Texas intermediate spot price of $65.56 per barrel and the natural gas average Henry Hub spot price of $3.10 per MCF.  Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. supplied reserve value estimates for the Company’s California, Texas, Oklahoma, Utah and Louisiana properties.  
 
Of course, net reserve value does not represent the fair market value of our reserves on that date, and we cannot be sure what return we will eventually receive on our reserves.  Net reserve value of proved developed and undeveloped reserves was calculated by subtracting estimated future development costs, future production costs and other operating expenses from estimated net future cash flows from our developed and undeveloped reserves.
 
Our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at December 31, 2018, was estimated to be $30,645,914.  This figure was calculated by subtracting our estimated future income tax expense from the net reserve value of proved developed and undeveloped reserves, and by further applying a 10% annual discount for estimated timing of cash flows.  A detailed calculation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow is contained in Supplemental Information about Oil and Gas Producing Activities – Changes in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flow from Proved Reserve Quantities, page F- 32.
 
Royale reported a gain on turnkey drilling in connection with the drilling of wells on a “turnkey contract” basis in the amount of $2,558,716 and $1,487,824 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
In addition to Royale’s own staff, Royale hires independent contractors to drill, test, complete and equip the wells that it drills.  Approximately 48.7% of Royale’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, came from sales of oil and natural gas from production of its wells in the amount of $1,599,362.  In 2017, this amount was $554,235, which represented 55.0% of Royale’s total revenues.
 
Plan of Business
 
Royale acquires interests in oil and natural gas reserves and sponsors private joint ventures.  Royale believes that its stockholders are better served by diversification of its investments among individual drilling prospects.  Through its sale of joint ventures, Royale can acquire interests and develop oil and natural gas properties with greater diversification of risk and still receive an interest in the revenues and reserves produced from these properties.  By selling some of its working interest in most projects, Royale decreases the amount of its investment in the projects and diversifies its oil and gas property holdings, to reduce the risk of concentrating a large amount of its capital in a few projects that may not be successful.
 
After acquiring the leases or lease participation, Royale drills or participates in the drilling of development and exploratory oil and natural gas wells on its property.  Royale pays its proportionate share of the actual cost of drilling, testing, and completing the project to the extent that it retains all or any portion of the working interest.
 
Royale also may sell fractional working interests in undeveloped wells to finance part of the drilling cost. A drilling contract that calls for a company to drill a well, for a fixed price, to a specified depth or geological formation is called a “turnkey contract.” When Royale sells fractional working interests in unproved property to raise capital to drill oil and natural gas wells, generally it agrees to drill these wells on a turnkey contract basis, so that the holders of the fractional interests prepay a fixed amount for the drilling and completion of a specified number of wells.  Under a turnkey contract, Royale may record a gain if total funds received to drill a well were more than the actual cost to drill those wells including costs incurred on behalf of the participants and costs incurred for its own account.
 
Although Royale’s operating agreements do not usually address whether investors have a right to participate in subsequent wells in the same area of interest as a proposed well, it is the Company’s policy to offer to investors in a successful well the right to participate in subsequent wells at the same percentage level as their working interest investment in the prior successful well.

Our policy for turnkey drilling agreements is to recognize a gain on turnkey drilling programs after our obligations have been fulfilled, and a gain is only recorded when funds received from participants are in excess of all costs Royale incurs during the drilling programs (e.g., lease acquisition, exploration and development costs), including costs incurred on behalf of participants and costs incurred for its own account.  See Note 1 to our Financial Statements, at page F-9.
 
Once drilling has commenced, it is generally completed within 10-30 days.  See Note 1 to Royale’s Financial Statements, at page F-9.  Royale maintains internal records of the expenditure of each investor’s funds for drilling projects.
 
Royale generally operates the wells it completes.  As operator, it receives fees set by industry standards from the owners of fractional interests in the wells and from expense reimbursements.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, Royale charged overhead from operation of the wells in the amount of $299,646 for the year, which were an offset to general and administrative expenses.  In 2017, the amount was $197,020.  At December 31, 2018, Royale operated 24 natural gas wells in California. Royale also has non-operating interests in seven oil and gas wells in California, three natural gas wells in Utah, four oil and gas wells in Texas, two in Oklahoma and one in Louisiana.
 
Royale currently sells most of its California natural gas production through PG&E pipelines to independent customers on a monthly contract basis, while some gas is delivered through privately owned pipelines to independent customers. Since many users are willing to make such purchase arrangements, the loss of any one customer would not affect our overall sales operations.
 
All oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets in which production naturally decreases over time as the finite amount of existing reserves are produced and sold.  It is Royale’s business as an oil and natural gas exploration and production company to continually search for new development properties.  The Company’s success will ultimately depend on its ability to continue locating and developing new oil and natural gas resources.  Natural gas demand and the prices paid for gas are seasonal. In recent years, natural gas demand and prices in Northern California have fluctuated unpredictably throughout the year.
 
Competition, Markets and Regulation
 
Competition
 
The exploration and production of oil and natural gas is an intensely competitive industry.  The sale of interests in oil and gas projects, like those Royale sells, is also very competitive.  Royale encounters competition from other oil and natural gas producers, as well as from other entities that invest in oil and gas for their own account or for others, and many of these companies are substantially larger than Royale.
Markets
 
Market factors affect the quantities of oil and natural gas production and the price Royale can obtain for the production from its oil and natural gas properties.  Such factors include: the extent of domestic production; the level of imports of foreign oil and natural gas; the general level of market demand on a regional, national and worldwide basis; domestic and foreign economic conditions that determine levels of industrial production; political events in foreign oil-producing regions; and variations in governmental regulations including environmental, energy conservation, and tax laws or the imposition of new regulatory requirements upon the oil and natural gas industry.
Regulation
 
Federal and state laws and regulations affect, to some degree, the production, transportation, and sale of oil and natural gas from Royale’s operations.  States in which Royale operates have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of oil and natural gas, including provisions regarding deliverability.  These statutes, along with the regulations interpreting the statutes, generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas, and to protect correlative rights to produce oil and natural gas by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or proration unit.
 
The exploration, development, production and processing of oil and natural gas are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations to protect the environment.  Various federal and state agencies are considering, and some have adopted, other laws and regulations regarding environmental controls that could increase the cost of doing business.  These laws and regulations may require: the acquisition of permits by operators before drilling commences; the prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness areas or where pollution arises; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling operations, particularly operations in offshore waters or on submerged lands.  The cost of oil and natural gas development and production also may increase because of the cost of compliance with such legislation and regulations, together with any penalties resulting from failing to comply with the legislation and regulations.  Ultimately, Royale may bear some of these costs.
 
 7


Presently, Royale does not anticipate that compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or its competitive position in the oil and natural gas industry; however, changes in the laws, rules or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, could have a materially adverse effect on Royale’s financial condition or results of operation.
 
REF has filed quarterly, yearly and other reports with the Securities Exchange Commission, and Royale will continue filing these reports as REF’s successor in interest.  You may obtain a copy of any materials filed by Royale with the SEC at 100 F Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, by calling 1-800-SEC-0300.  The SEC also maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.  Royale also provides access to its SEC reports and other public announcements on its website, http://www.royl.com.
 
Item 1 – Description of Business – Merger with Matrix Oil Management Corporation.

Joint Venture with RMX Resources, LLC
 
On April 4 and April 13, 2018, Royale contributed certain assets to RMX Resources, LLC pursuant to a Contribution Agreement described in Item 1 – Description of Business – Joint Venture with RMX Resources, LLC.
Critical Accounting Policies
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Royale’s primary business is oil and gas production.  Natural gas flows from the wells into gathering line systems, which are equipped occasionally with compressor systems, which in turn flow into metered transportation and customer pipelines.  Monthly, price data and daily production are used to invoice customers for amounts due to Royale and other working interest owners.  Royale operates most of its own wells and receives industry standard operator fees. These Supervisory fees are recognized as a reduction to the company’s General and Administrative expenses.
 
Royale generally sells crude oil and natural gas under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. Revenues are recognized when the products are delivered, which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership, prices are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
 
Revenues from the production of oil and natural gas properties in which the Royale has an interest with other producers are recognized on the basis of Royale’s net working interest. Differences between actual production and net working interest volumes are not significant.
 
Royale’s financial statements include its pro rata ownership of wells.  Royale usually sells a portion of the working interest in each well it drills or participates in to third party investors and retains a portion of the prospect for its own account.   All results, successful or not, are included at its pro rata ownership amounts: revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities as defined in FASB ASC 932-323-25 and 932-360.
 
The Company records amounts received from the Master Service Agreement (“MSA”) with RMX for providing land, engineering, accounting and back-office support as part of revenues. Revenues earned under the MSA are recorded at the end of each month that services were performed in conformity with the Agreement with an offsetting receivable from the RMX joint venture. The service fee income is treated as earned at the end of each month that services are performed as provided by contract.
 
Equity Method Investments
 
Investments in entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Income from equity method investments represents Royale’s proportionate share of net income generated by the equity method. Equity method investments are included as noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
Business Combinations
 
From time-to-time, the Company acquires businesses in the oil and gas industry. Businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. We recognize, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition-date fair values. We measure and recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of: (1) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred, the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree (if any) and the acquisition date fair value of our previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over (2) the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If information about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which a business combination occurs, we report provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. The measurement or allocation period ends once we receive the information we are seeking; however, this period will generally not exceed one year from the acquisition date. Any material adjustments recognized during the measurement period will be reflected retrospectively in the consolidated financial statements of the subsequent period. We recognize third-party transaction related costs as expense currently in the period in which they are incurred.
 
Fair value considerations include the evaluation of the underlying documentation supporting receivables, property, other assets and liabilities. If the documentation and support for a receivable or other asset represented by the seller is not deemed acceptable by the Company’s auditors, the receivable or other asset is not considered in the purchase price until such time as the receivable or other asset can be proven to a level acceptable to the Company’s auditors.
 
 12


Any receipts by the company of cash or other assets, subsequent to the transaction date for which the merger documentation was considered insufficient at the time of the merger, the company recognizes as a current liability. At such time as the documentation is deemed acceptable, the liability is relieved with a credit to earnings in the period of determination.
 
When the Company pays more than fair market value for an asset, it records the overage as an intangible asset (“goodwill”). In the event that the Company pays less than fair market value for an asset(s) this results in “negative goodwill” or a so called “bargain purchase”. In the event of a bargain purchase, the Company will reevaluate the fair market value of the asset(s) being acquired until such time as there is no negative goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31st, or when an indicator of impairment exists. We compare the fair value of our reporting units with the carrying value, including goodwill. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of recorded goodwill, as applicable.
 
Oil and Gas Property and Equipment
 
Depreciation, depletion and amortization, based on cost less estimated salvage value of the asset, are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration.  Maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance, are expensed as incurred.  Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and the assets replaced are retired.
 
The project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use.  Interest costs, to the extent they are incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase, are included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets.
 
Royale uses the “successful efforts” method to account for its exploration and production activities.  Under this method, Royale accumulates its proportionate share of costs on a well-by-well basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred, and capitalizes expenditures for productive wells.  Royale amortizes the costs of productive wells under the unit-of-production method.
 
Royale carries, as an asset, exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and where Royale is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project.  Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred.
 
Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and gas reserves.
 
Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs associated with productive depletable extractive properties are amortized using unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating methods.  Under the unit-of-production method, oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.
 
Production costs are expensed as incurred. Production involves lifting the oil and gas to the surface and gathering, treating, field processing and field storage of the oil and gas. The production function normally terminates at the outlet valve on the lease or field production storage tank. Production costs are those incurred to operate and maintain Royale’s wells and related equipment and facilities. They become part of the cost of oil and gas produced. These costs, sometimes referred to as lifting costs, include such items as labor costs to operate the wells and related equipment; repair and maintenance costs on the wells and equipment; materials, supplies and energy costs required to operate the wells and related equipment; and administrative expenses related to the production activity. Proved oil and gas properties held and used by Royale are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
 
Royale estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. Cash flows used in impairment evaluations are developed using annually updated evaluation assumptions for crude oil commodity prices.  Annual volumes are based on field production profiles, which are also updated annually. Prices for natural gas and other products are based on assumptions developed annually for evaluation purposes.
 
 13


Impairment analyses are generally based on proved reserves.  An asset group would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value.  Impairments are measured by the amount the carrying value exceeds fair value. During 2018 and 2017, impairment losses of $1,183,515 and $289,775, respectively, were recorded on various capitalized lease and land costs where the carrying value exceeded the fair value or where the leases were no longer viable.
 
Significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that Royale expects to hold the properties.  The valuation allowances are reviewed at least annually.
 
Upon the sale or retirement of a complete field of a proved property, Royale eliminates the cost from its books, and the resultant gain or loss is recorded to Royale’s Statement of Operations.  Upon the sale of an entire interest in an unproved property where the property has been assessed for impairment individually, a gain or loss is recognized in Royale’s Statement of Operations.  If a partial interest in an unproved property is sold, any funds received are accounted for as a recovery of the cost in the interest retained with any excess funds recognized as a gain. Should Royale’s turnkey drilling agreements include unproved property, total drilling costs incurred to satisfy its obligations are recovered by the total funds received under the agreements.  Any excess funds are recorded as a Gain on Turnkey Drilling Programs, and any costs not recovered are capitalized and accounted for under the “successful efforts” method.
 
Royale sponsors turnkey drilling agreement arrangements in unproved properties as a pooling of assets in a joint undertaking, whereby proceeds from participants are reported as Deferred Drilling Obligations, and then reduced as costs to complete its obligations are incurred with any excess booked against its property account to reduce any basis in its own interest.  Gains on Turnkey Drilling Programs represent funds received from turnkey drilling participants in excess of all costs Royale incurs during the drilling programs (e.g., lease acquisition, exploration and development costs), including costs incurred on behalf of participants and costs incurred for its own account; and are recognized only upon making this determination after Royale’s obligations have been fulfilled.
 
The contracts require the participants pay Royale the full contract price upon execution of the agreement.   Royale completes the drilling activities typically between 10 and 30 days after drilling begins.  The participant retains an undivided or proportional beneficial interest in the property, and is also responsible for its proportionate share of operating costs.  Royale retains legal title to the lease.  The participants purchase a working interest directly in the well bore.
 
In these working interest arrangements, the participants are responsible for sharing in the risk of development, but also sharing in a proportional interest in rights to revenues and proportional liability for the cost of operations after drilling is completed.
 
Since the participant’s interest in the prospect is limited to the well, and not the lease, the investor does not have a legal right to participate in additional wells drilled within the same lease.  However, it is the Company’s policy to offer to participants in a successful well the right to participate in subsequent wells at the same percentage level as their working interest investment in the prior successful well with similar turnkey drilling agreement terms.
 
A certain portion of the turnkey drilling participant’s funds received are non-refundable.    The company records a liability for all funds invested as deferred drilling obligations until each individual well is complete.  Occasionally, drilling is delayed for various reasons such as weather, permitting, drilling rig availability and/or contractual obligations.  At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Royale had deferred drilling obligations of $6,213,283 and $5,891,898 respectively.
 
If Royale is unable to drill the wells, and a suitable replacement well is not found, Royale would retain the non-refundable portion of the contract and return the remaining funds to the participant.  Included in cash and cash equivalents are amounts for use in completion of turnkey drilling programs in progress. 
 
Losses on properties sold are recognized when incurred or when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the properties is less than the carrying value.
 
Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The most significant estimates pertain to proved oil, plant products and gas reserve volumes and the future development costs.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
 14


Deferred Income Taxes
 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects, calculated at currently enacted rates, of (a) future deductible/taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the financial statements or income tax returns, and (b) operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.  All available evidence, both positive and negative, must be considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed.  The Company uses information about the Company’s financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years.
 
The Company must use its judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset. A cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.
 
Future realization of a tax benefit sometimes will be expected for a portion, but not all, of a deferred tax asset, and the dividing line between the two portions may be unclear. In those circumstances, application of judgment based on a careful assessment of all available evidence is required to determine the portion of a deferred tax asset for which it is more likely than not a tax benefit will not be realized.
 
Going Concern
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $71,050,426, a working capital deficiency of $5,471,153 and a stockholders’ equity of $2,740,958. As a result, our financial statements include a “going concern qualification” reflecting substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1 to our audited financial statements.  We have merged with Matrix to increase efficiency and reduce costs to both companies, thereby allowing a return to positive cash flow.  We are exploring commitments to provide additional financing, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed to fully fund our 2019 drilling budget and to support future operations.
Results of Operations for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018, as Compared to the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017
 
The merger between Royale Energy and Matrix Oil Management was completed during the first quarter of 2018.  For the year in 2018, the consolidated amounts represented here are for the full year for Royale Energy, Inc. and the ten month period for Matrix Oil Management and its subsidiaries.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a net loss of $23,504,327 compared to the net loss of $2,427,169 during the year in 2017. For the year in 2018, we had a loss from operations of $3,204,056, the major components of the remaining $20,300,271 net loss during the year were:
 

Gain on Settlement of Accounts Payable | | 287,134 | 
---------------------------------------+---+-------------+--
Loss on Sale of Assets, net | | (19,199,045 | )
Loss on Issuance of Warrants | | (1,439,990 | )
Interest Expense | | (177,171 | )
Gain on Investment in Joint Venture | | 333,931 | 
Other Loss – Major Components | $ | (20,195,141 | )

 

The majority of the loss on sale of assets of $20,092,402 was recorded upon the transfer of oil and gas properties to RMX and surface rights in exchange for cash and a 20 percent working interest in RMX under the Contribution Agreement, along with subsequent purchase price adjustments. This loss was offset by a $550,000 gain on the sale of seismic data and a $334,661 gain on the sale of previously owned Matrix leases. Under the Contribution Agreement, we also issued warrants to acquire 4,000,000 shares of Royale common stock and recorded a loss of $1,439,990.  The gain on investment in joint venture of $333,931 represents Royale’s share of RMX’s net income from operations through the year ended December 31, 2018.   See Note 2 – Formation of RMX and Asset Contribution.

During the year in 2018, revenues from oil and gas production increased $1,045,127 or 188.6% to $1,599,362 from the 2017 revenues of $554,235.  This increase was due to higher production volumes associated with the merger.  The net sales volume of oil for the year ended December 31, 2018, was approximately 18,570 barrels with an average price of $64.10 per barrel, versus 102 barrels with an average price of $46.07 per barrel for the same period in 2017.  This represents an increase in net sales volume of 18,468 barrels. The net sales volume of natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2018, was approximately 135,396 Mcf with an average price of $2.85 per Mcf, versus 190,111 Mcf with an average price of $2.89 per Mcf for the same period in 2017.  This represents a decrease in net sales volume of 54,715 Mcf or 28.8%.  The decrease in natural gas production volume was due to several of our operated wells being offline during the year in 2018 due to new pipeline equipment requirements by Pacific Gas & Electric and to the natural declines of our remaining wells.
 
Oil and natural gas lease operating expenses increased by $1,177,731 or 270.4%, to $1,613,368 for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $435,637 for the year in 2017.  This was higher due to the increase in the number of wells operated by the Company during the period in 2018, related to the merger.  When measuring lease operating costs on a production or lifting cost basis, in 2018, the $1,613,368 equates to a $6.54 per MCFE lifting cost versus a $2.28 per MCFE lifting cost in 2017, a 160.2% increase, due to higher operating costs related to non-operated wells in 2018.
 
The aggregate of supervisory fees and other income was $1,683,679 for year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1,230,535 or 271.6% from $453,144 during the year in 2017. This increase was mainly due to the receipt of service agreement fees through an arrangement with RMX Resources, LLC.
 
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased to $722,935 from $116,017, an increase of $606,918 or 523.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year in 2017. The depletion rate is calculated using production as a percentage of reserves.  This increase in depreciation expense was due to the increase in the number of wells and related equipment operated by the Company as a result of the merger consolidation.
 
General and administrative expenses increased by $1,130,379 or 56.4% from $2,005,630 for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $3,136,009 for the year in 2018. This increase was primarily due to merger related increases in employee associated costs of $631,896 and outside consulting of $563,452 when compared to 2017.  Legal and accounting expense decreased to $1,391,037 for the year in 2018, compared to $1,540,190 for the year in 2017, a $149,153 or 9.7% decrease.  This decrease was primarily due to lower legal and accounting fees related to the Matrix merger, which concluded during the first quarter. Marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased $71,981, or 26.8%, to $340,641, compared to $268,660 for the year in 2017.  Marketing expense varies from period to period according to the number of marketing events attended by personnel and their associated costs.
 
At December 31, 2018, Royale Energy had a Deferred Drilling Obligation of $6,213,283.  During 2018, we disposed of $6,128,615 of drilling obligations upon completing the drilling of four natural gas wells in Northern California, while incurring expenses of $3,569,899, resulting in a gain of $2,558,716. At December 31, 2017, Royale had a deferred drilling obligation of $5,891,898.  During 2017, we disposed of $5,934,604 of obligations relating to 2016, upon completing the drilling of three developmental natural gas wells and participating in the drilling of an additional developmental oil well, while incurring expenses of $4,446,780.  This resulted in a gain of $1,487,824.   
 
During 2018, we recorded a gain on investment in joint venture of $333,931 as our 20% share of RMX Resources, LLC’s period net income of $1,669,654, see discussion in Note 2.  During 2018, we also recorded a $105,130 loss on derivative instruments, reflecting the period end market-to market changes in the fair value positions, related to Matrix operations prior to the conclusion of the merger.  During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded gains of $287,134 and $73,325, respectively, on the settlement of accounts payable.  Impairment losses of $1,183,515 and $289,775 were recorded in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  We periodically review our proved properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis and charge impairments of value to the expense.  In 2017, the impairments were on various capitalized leases that were no longer viable.  During the years in 2018 and 2017, we recorded write downs of $9,790 and $16,375, respectively on certain well equipment that was no longer useable.
 
Bad debt expense for 2018 and 2017 were $648,518 and $164,145, respectively.  The expenses in 2018 and 2017 arose from identified uncollectable receivables relating to our oil and natural gas properties either plugged and abandoned or scheduled for plugging and abandonment and our year-end oil and natural gas reserve values.  We periodically review our accounts receivable from working interest owners to determine whether collection of any of these charges appears doubtful.  By contract, the Company may not collect some charges from its Direct Working Interest owners for certain wells that ceased production or had been sold during the year, to the extent that these charges exceed production revenue.

Interest expense increased to $177,171 for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $159,268 in 2017, a $17,903 increase.  This increase resulted from interest accrued on the term loan agreement originated by Matrix.  Further details concerning this agreement can be found in Capital Resources and Liquidity, below.  
 
In 2018 and 2017, we did not have an income tax expense due to the use of a percentage depletion carryover valuation allowance created from the current and past operations resulting in an effective tax rate less than the new federal rate of 21% plus the relevant state rates (mostly California, 8.8%).  
 
Capital Resources and Liquidity
 
At December 31, 2018, Royale had current assets totaling $8,258,012 and current liabilities totaling $14,983,369, a $6,725,357 working capital deficit.  We had cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 of $1,853,742 and restricted cash of $4,501,300 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $278,227 and restricted cash of $3,060,466 at December 31, 2017.
 
Ordinarily, we fund our operations and cash needs from our available credit and cash flows generated from operations.  We believe that consummation of the Merger will enable the combined companies to meet their liquidity demands.  However, because the Merger results in different liquidity needs than Royale had before the Merger, there is doubt as to the ability to meet liquidity demands through cash flow or ongoing operations.  In that event, the Company will seek alternative capital sources through additional sales of equity or debt securities, or the sale of property.
 
At December 31, 2018, our other receivables, which consist of joint interest billing receivables from direct working interest investors and industry partners, totaled $1,411,144, compared to $764,015 at December 31, 2017, a $647,129 increase.  This increase was mainly due to receivables from an affiliate for contracted services and an industry partner for drilling operations.  At December 31, 2018, revenue receivable was $316,974, an increase of $210,967, compared to $106,007 at December 31, 2017, due to higher oil and gas production volumes on wells that were drilled or came back on production in 2018.  At December 31, 2018, our accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled $4,895,533, an increase of $256,654 from the accounts payable at December 31, 2017 of $4,638,879, mainly related to drilling of one well at year end 2018 and operations related trade accounts payable. 
 
In July 2016, we received a cash investment of $1,580,000 from two investors to purchase convertible promissory notes with principal amounts of $1,280,000 and $300,000, with a conversion price of $0.40 per share, with warrants to purchase one share of common stock for every three shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes.  The notes originally matured on August 2, 2017, one year from the date of issuance, and carried a 10% interest rate, with a default rate of 25%.  Shortly before completion of the Merger, the $300,000 note and accrued interest of $47,500 was converted into 750,000 shares of Royale common stock valued at $347,500, and Royale agreed to a cash settlement with the holder of the $1,280,000 note for $1,900,000, which was paid on April 13, 2018.
 
In conjunction with the Purchase and Sale Agreement on June 15, 2016, Matrix Oil Management Corp entered into a term loan agreement with Arena Limited SPV, LLC (Term Loan) for approximately $12.4 million. The proceeds of the term loan were used for the approximately 50% working interest purchase of the oil and gas properties noted above in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the payoff of the existing Credit Facility, payment of legal and other loan costs, and other working capital needs of the Company as defined in the loan agreement. The original maturity date of the Term Loan was June 15, 2018, it was secured by the assets of Matrix, and contained financial covenants commencing June 30, 2016 and thereafter, as defined in the term loan agreement. The Term Loan contained preferential payment requirements in advance of the amounts outstanding under the subordinated notes payable to partners, as defined in the term loan agreement.  The Term Loan Agreement called for interest at the rate of nine percent (9%) plus the adjusted LIBOR Rate computed on a daily basis.  The loan balance as of March 31, 2018 was $11,140,749.  The Company recognized $164,401 in interest expense for the period ended March 31, 2018.  In April 2018 pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, this loan agreement was paid in full.
 
We have not engaged in hedging activities or use derivative instruments to manage market risks.
 
The following schedule summarizes our known contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2018, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.

Operating Activities.  For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, cash used by operating activities totaled $2,865,829 and $1,199,439, respectively.  This $1,666,390 or 138.9% increase in cash used was due to higher receivables from an affiliate for contracted services, an industry drilling partner accounts and revenue receivables due to higher production volumes. It was also higher in 2018 due to higher merger related royalty and affiliate payables.   
Investing Activities.   Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $8,183,844 for the year ended December 31, 2018.  Net cash used by investing activities totaled $456,466 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The difference in cash during the year in 2018 was due to approximately $4 million in cash received in the merger and for the oil and gas asset sale and contribution in the formation of RMX Resources, LLC, discussed previously. In 2018, we also received $550,000 on the sale of a seismic license and approximately $412,000 for the sale of various lease interests previously owned by Matrix. During the year in 2018, we also received approximately $6.5 million in direct working interest investor turnkey drilling investments, while in 2017 we received approximately $3.9 million. Additionally, our turnkey drilling expenditures were higher in 2017, where we drilled three natural gas wells and participated in the drilling of an oil well, while in 2018 we drilled four natural gas wells and completed two, due to formation difficulties in one well and the other was dry. 
Financing Activities.  Net cash used by financing activities totaled $2,301,666 in 2018, mainly due to the $1.9 million settlement payment for the cash advances on pending transactions. In 2018, we also paid $274,920 for principal and fee payments on the Matrix originated term loan agreement.  In 2018, we paid $126,746 on a note payable to an industry partner for lease operating and plugging and abandonment costs. No net cash was provided or used in financing activities during 2017.
Changes in Reserve Estimates
 
During 2018, our overall proved developed and undeveloped natural gas reserves increased by 40.1% and our previously estimated proved developed and undeveloped natural gas reserve quantities were revised downward by approximately .40 million cubic feet of natural gas.  This downward revision was mainly the result of one location with previously estimated proved undeveloped natural gas reserves which the Company had decided not to drill.  See Supplemental Information about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited), page F-29. 
 
During 2017, our overall proved developed and undeveloped reserves increased by 4% and our previously estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserve quantities were revised upward by approximately .31 million cubic feet of natural gas.  This upward revision reflected higher than previously estimated proved producing and non-producing natural gas reserves at eight California wells and one Utah well.  See Supplemental Information about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited), page F-29.
