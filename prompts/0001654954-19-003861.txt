We believe this strategy will help us to develop a portfolio of high-quality product development opportunities, enhance our clinical development and commercialization capabilities, and increase our ability to generate value from our proprietary technologies.
 
  Our Current Programs
 
  Levosimendan Background
 
 Levosimendan was discovered and developed by Orion Corporation, a Finnish company, or Orion. Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer/K-ATP activator developed for intravenous use in hospitalized patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. It is currently approved in over 60 countries for this indication and not available in the United States or Canada. It is estimated that to date over 1,000,000 patients have been treated worldwide with levosimendan.
 
 Levosimendan is a novel, first in class calcium sensitizer/K-ATP activator. The therapeutic effects of levosimendan are mediated through:
  
   ●
 Increased cardiac contractility by calcium sensitization of troponin C, resulting in a positive inotropic effect which is not associated with substantial increases in oxygen demand.

   ●
 Opening of potassium channels in the vasculature smooth muscle, resulting in a vasodilatory effect on all vascular beds.

   ●
 Opening of mitochondrial potassium channels in cardiomyocytes, resulting in a cardioprotective effect.

  
 This triple mechanism of action helps to preserve heart function during cardiac surgery. Several studies have demonstrated that levosimendan protects the heart and improves tissue perfusion while minimizing tissue damage during cardiac surgery.
 
 In 2013, we acquired certain assets of Phyxius Pharma, Inc., or Phyxius, including its North American rights to develop and commercialize levosimendan for any indication in the United States and Canada. In the countries where levosimendan is marketed, levosimendan is indicated for the short-term treatment of acutely decompensated severe chronic heart failure in situations where conventional therapy is not sufficient, and in cases where inotropic support is considered appropriate. In acute decompensated heart failure patients, levosimendan has been shown to significantly improve patients’ symptoms as well as acute hemodynamic measurements such as increased cardiac output, reduced preload and reduced afterload.

  The European Society of Cardiology, or the ESC, recommends levosimendan as a preferable agent over dobutamine to reverse the effect of beta blockade if it is thought to be contributing to hypotension. The ESC guidelines also state that levosimendan is not appropriate for patients with systolic blood pressure less than 85mmHg or in patients in cardiogenic shock unless it is used in combination with other inotropes or vasopressors. Other unique properties of levosimendan include sustained efficacy through the formation of a long acting metabolite, lack of impairment of diastolic function, and evidence of better compatibility with beta blockers than dobutamine.
 
  Levosimendan Development for Pulmonary Hypertension Patients
 
 We are currently initiating a Phase 2 clinical trial of levosimendan in North America for the treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or PH-HFpEF. PH-HFpEF is defined hemodynamically by a pulmonary artery pressure, or mPAP, ≥25 mmHg, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, or PCWP, >15 mmHg, and a diastolic pressure gradient, or diastolic PAP – PCWP, >7mmHg. Pulmonary hypertension in these patients initially develops from a passive backward transmission of elevated filling pressures from left-sided heart failure. These mechanical components of pulmonary venous congestion may trigger pulmonary vasoconstriction, decreased nitric oxide availability, increased endothelin expression, desensitization to natriuretic peptide induced vasodilation, and vascular remodeling.  Finally, these changes often lead to advanced pulmonary vascular disease, increased right ventricle, or RV, afterload, and RV failure.
 
 PH-HFpEF is a common form of pulmonary hypertension with an estimated US prevalence exceeding 1.5 million patients. Currently, no pharmacologic therapies are approved for treatment of PH-HFpEF.  Despite the fact that many therapies have been studied in PH-HFpEF patients, including therapies approved to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension patients, no therapies have been shown to be effective in treating PH-HFpEF patients.
 
 Published pre-clinical and clinical studies indicate that levosimendan may provide important benefits to patients with pulmonary hypertension. Data from these published trials indicate that levosimendan may reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and improve important cardiovascular hemodynamics such as reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with pulmonary hypertension. In addition, several published studies provide evidence that levosimendan may improve right ventricular dysfunction which is a common comorbidity in patients with pulmonary hypertension. While none of these studies have focused specifically on PH-HFpEF patients, the general hemodynamic improvements in these published studies of various types of pulmonary hypertension provide an indication that levosimendan may be beneficial in PH-HFpEF patients.
 
 In March 2018, we met with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to discuss development of levosimendan in PH-HFpEF patients. The FDA agreed with our planned Phase 2 design, patient entry criteria, and endpoints. The study may be conducted under the existing investigational new drug application with no additional nonclinical studies required to support full development. The FDA recognized there were no approved drug therapies to treat PH-HFpEF patients and acknowledged this provided an opportunity for a limited Phase 3 clinical program. This topic will be discussed further at the End-of-Phase 2 Meeting following completion of the planned Phase 2 study in PH-HFpEF patients. We initiated the first of our expected 10-12 clinical sites in November 2018 and the first of 36 patients was enrolled in the study in March 2019.
 
  Levosimendan Development for Cardiac Surgery Patients
 
 Low cardiac output syndrome, or LCOS, is generally defined as a patient’s inability to maintain a cardiac index >2.2 L/min/m2 and hence requiring use of inotropic agents and/or mechanical assist devices such as an intra-aortic balloon pump or a left ventricular assistance device. LCOS in the cardiac surgery setting is reported to occur in 5-10% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and is associated with 10-15-fold higher mortality or severe sequelae as a result of poor organ perfusion.
  
 Currently, no pharmacologic therapies are approved for management or prevention of post-cardiotomy LCOS. While conventional inotropes are used to manage cardiac hemodynamics in the peri-operative setting, none have been shown to improve outcomes.
  
 Substantial published scientific research indicates that levosimendan may provide important benefits to cardiac surgery patients, including 35 published prospectively designed clinical trials and multiple published meta-analyses. Many of these publications indicate that levosimendan provides substantial mortality and or morbidity benefits to cardiac surgery patients, particularly those at risk of developing LCOS.

 In 2014, we initiated a Phase 3 trial (LEVO-CTS) to investigate the safety and efficacy of pre-operative administration of levosimendan treatment to reduce the mortality and morbidity in cardiac surgery patients at risk for developing LCOS. The Phase 3 trial was conducted under an FDA approved Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, and with FDA granted Fast Track status for the development of levosimendan to reduce mortality and morbidity in cardiac surgery patients at risk of LCOS. Pursuant to our license to levosimendan, we are required to use the “Simdax®” trademark to commercialize this product.
  
 The LEVO-CTS trial design was guided by the published literature, including important dosing refinements and inclusion of patients with low preoperative ejection fraction. In addition, we relied heavily on the input of European clinicians who have significant personal clinical experience with the use of levosimendan in treating cardiac surgery patients.
  
 Current data in cardiac surgery suggest that levosimendan is superior to traditional inotropes (dobutamine, phosphodiesterase [PDE]-inhibitors) as it achieves:
 
   ●
 sustained hemodynamic improvement;

   ●
 diminished myocardial injury;

   ●
 improved tissue perfusion;

   ●
 better outcomes and fewer hospital days;

   ●
 effects most favorable in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (< 40%); and

   ●
 opportunity to initiate therapy pre-operatively due to increased cardiac contractility without increasing intracellular calcium, without increasing oxygen consumption, or affecting cardiac rhythm and relaxation.

 
 The Phase 3 trial was conducted in approximately 60 major cardiac surgery centers in North America. The trial enrolled patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafts, or CABG, and/or mitral valve surgery, and CABG with aortic valve surgery who are at risk for developing LCOS. The trial was designed as a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study seeking to enroll 760 patients. During 2016 we made the decision to increase enrollment in the LEVO-CTS trial to 880 patients. These additional patients were necessary to ensure sufficient powering and were necessary due to:
  
   ●
 a small percentage of patients who were randomized but did not receive the study drug;

   ●
 a small percentage of patients who were missing one or more component measurements of the primary endpoint; and

   ●
 a slightly lower primary endpoint event rate than we originally projected.

  
  Enrollment began in the third quarter of calendar year 2014 and was completed in December of 2016. On January 31, 2017, we announced top-line results from the Phase 3 LEVO-CTS trial. Levosimendan, given prophylactically prior to cardiac surgery to patients with reduced left ventricular function, had no effect on the co-primary outcomes. The study did not achieve statistically significant reductions in the dual endpoint of death or use of a mechanical assist device at 30 days, nor in the quad endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, need for dialysis, or use of a mechanical assist device at 30 days.
  
  However, the study results demonstrated statistically significant reductions in two of three secondary endpoints including reduction in LCOS and a reduction in postoperative use of secondary inotropes. Additionally, levosimendan was found to be safe with no clinically significant increases in hypotension or cardiac arrhythmias and the clinical data showed a non-significant numerical reduction in 90-day mortality.
  
  A post hoc analysis on patients in whom isolated CABG surgery was performed (66% of the patients) revealed that levosimendan improved 90-day survival significantly (p=0.0017). This was accompanied with a significant improvement in postoperative cardiac index, in the frequency of LCOS and in the need for further inotropic support. Accordingly, the reductions in the incidence of LCOS were associated with a substantial improvement in mortality. However, there was essentially no effect on any of these endpoints in those LEVO-CTS patients receiving valve surgeries.

  In the second and third quarters of 2017 we explored the opportunity for submitting a new drug application, or NDA, for use of levosimendan in CABG surgery patients on the basis of the robust reduction in 90-day mortality observed in the LEVO-CTS trial. However, the FDA advised that another study in CABG surgery patients would be required that prospectively tests levosimendan’s effectiveness in improving mortality.
  
  Accordingly, we have suspended development of levosimendan for use in CABG patients due to the scope of the repeat study, as required by the FDA. The incidence of 90-day mortality in CABG surgery patients is low (~8%). The repeat study would need to randomize approximately 1200 CABG surgery patients with low LVEF (<35%) to demonstrate a >50% risk reduction in mortality. Based on this analysis, we determined the cost and timing of this study would outweigh the likely benefit.

  Intellectual Property
 
 We rely on a combination of patent applications, patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. We believe that to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. Currently, we require our officers, employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment, consulting, or advisory relationships with us, where appropriate. We also require our employees, consultants, and advisors who we expect to work on our products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the work day, developed using our property, or which relate to our business.
 
 To date, we own or in-license the rights to six U.S. and foreign patents. In addition, we have one U.S. patent application pending related to a product candidate and proprietary process, method and technology. Our issued and in-licensed patents, as well as our pending patents, expire between 2023 and 2038.
 
 We have:
 
   ●
 one U.S. patent (8,404,752), one Australian Patent (209,271,530) and one European patent (EPO9798325.8) held jointly with Virginia Commonwealth University Intellectual Property Foundation for the treatment of traumatic brain injury;

   ●
 one Israeli patent (215516) and numerous patent applications, including one U.S. patent application, for the formulation of perfluorocarbon emulsion with an average remaining life of approximately 13 years; and

   ●
 two U.S. patents (6,730,673 and 6,943,164) for the intravenous formulation of levosimendan as in-licensed patent rights for our development and commercialization of levosimendan in the United States and Canada.

 
 Our patent and patent applications include claims covering all various uses of levosimendan, our lead product candidate currently under development, as well as the manufacturing and use of our perfluorocarbon emulsion formulation.
 
 The U.S. trademark registration for Simdax® is owned by Orion and is licensed to us for sales and marketing purposes for any pharmaceutical products containing levosimendan that are commercialized in the United States and Canada.
 
  Competition
 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Many companies, including biotechnology, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, are actively engaged in activities similar to ours, including research and development of drugs for the treatment of rare medical conditions. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations than we do. In addition, some of them have considerable experience in preclinical testing, clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures. In addition, there are also academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations that are conducting research in areas in which we are working. We expect to encounter significant competition for any of the pharmaceutical products we plan to develop.

 We believe the concept of using levosimendan to treat patients with PH-HFpEF is novel. Because no therapies are approved to treat PH-HFpEF, our ability to succeed in the market is dependent on our ability to change the established practice paradigm, which is never an easy task. Key factors on which we will compete with regards to the development and marketing of levosimendan for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension include, among others, the ability to obtain adequate efficacy data, safety data, cost effectiveness data and hospital formulary approval, as well as sufficient distribution and handling. Furthermore, while we believe the mechanism of action of levosimendan is novel, other low priced generically available products possess some similar qualities, which could present competition in the form of therapeutic substitution.
    
 In order to compete successfully in this and other therapeutic areas, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for therapeutic markets that have not been satisfactorily addressed by conventional research strategies. Our product candidates, even if successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.
 
  Government Regulation
 
 The manufacture and distribution of levosimendan will require the approval of United States government authorities as well as those of foreign countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates medical products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our medical products. In addition to FDA regulations, we are also subject to other federal and state regulations, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Environmental Protection Act. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework requires a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial funds.
 
 Preclinical tests include evaluation of product chemistry and studies to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product and its formulation. The results of the preclinical tests are submitted to the FDA as part of the application. The goal of clinical testing is the demonstration in adequate and well-controlled studies of substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the product in the setting of its intended use. The results of preclinical and clinical testing are submitted to the FDA from time to time throughout the trial process. In addition, before approval for the commercial sale of a product can be obtained, results of the preclinical and clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. The testing and approval process requires substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The approval process is affected by a number of factors, including the severity of the condition being treated, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Additional preclinical studies or clinical trials may be requested during the FDA review process and may delay product approval. After FDA approval for its initial indications, further clinical trials may be necessary to gain approval for the use of a product for additional indications. The FDA may also require post-marketing testing, which can involve significant expense, to monitor for adverse effects.
 
  The ongoing HELP study in PH-HFpEF patients incorporates FDA advice. An End of Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA is planned in 2020 to review results of the HELP study and Phase 3 study design in development of levosimendan for treatment of PH-HFpEF patients.
 
  Employees
 
 We believe that our success will be based on, among other things, the quality of our clinical programs, our ability to invent and develop superior and innovative technologies and products, and our ability to attract and retain capable management and other personnel. We have assembled a high-quality team of clinical development managers and executives with significant experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.
 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had nine full-time employees and one part-time employee. In addition to our employees, we also use the service and support of outside consultants and advisors. None of our employees are represented by a union, and we believe relationships with our employees are good.
