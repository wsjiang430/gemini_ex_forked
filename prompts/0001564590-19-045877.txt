ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 Panhandle Oil and Gas Inc. was founded in Range, Texas County, Oklahoma, in 1926, as Panhandle Cooperative Royalty Company. The Company operated as a cooperative until 1979, when it merged into Panhandle Royalty Company, and its shares became publicly traded. On April 2, 2007, the Company’s name was changed to Panhandle Oil and Gas Inc.
 Panhandle Oil and Gas Inc. is an Oklahoma City-based company focused on perpetual oil and natural gas mineral ownership in resource plays in the United States. In addition, as part of our evolution as a company, we own interests in leasehold acreage and non-operated interests in oil and natural gas properties. Historically, we have participated with a working interest on some of our mineral and leasehold acreage. 
 Strategic Focus on Mineral Ownership
 During fiscal 2019, the Company made the strategic decision to focus on perpetual oil and natural gas mineral ownership and growth through mineral acquisitions and the development of its significant mineral acreage inventory in its core areas of focus. In accordance with this strategy, the Company plans to cease taking any working interest positions on its mineral and leasehold acreage going forward. The Company believes that its strategy to focus on mineral ownership is the best path to giving our stockholders the greatest risk-weighted returns on their investments going forward. 
 A “mineral fee” is an interest in real property in which the owner owns all of the rights to the minerals under the surface forever, as compared to a mineral lease in which the lessee’s rights end at the expiration of the lease term or after there is no longer production on the lease. Generally, the mineral interest owner of a mineral fee interest reserves a non-cost bearing royalty interest upon the lease of such oil, gas, and other minerals to an oil and gas exploration and development company. Such companies will lease such mineral interest from the fee mineral owner for a term with the expectation of producing oil and gas, thereby generating free cash flow from bonuses and royalties. As referenced above, Panhandle’s leasehold interests are non-operated working interests on the lease of the minerals from the mineral fee owner. These non-operated working interests require Panhandle to contribute its proportionate share of the costs incurred by the operator in the development of such minerals. As discussed above and further below, Panhandle no longer expects to participate with such working interests going forward. Panhandle’s mineral and leasehold properties are located primarily in Oklahoma, North Dakota, Texas, Arkansas and New Mexico. The majority of our oil, NGL and natural gas production is from wells located in Oklahoma, North Dakota, Texas and Arkansas.
 Although a significant amount of our revenues is currently derived from the production and sale of oil, NGL and natural gas on our working interests, a growing portion of our revenues is derived from royalties granted from the production and sale of oil, NGL and natural gas. These royalties are tied to ownership of mineral acreage, and this ownership is perpetual, unless sold by 
 1


the Company. Royalties are due and payable to the Company whenever oil, NGL or natural gas is produced and sold from wells located on the Company’s mineral acreage.
 We owned approximately 258,231 perpetual mineral acres as of September 30, 2019, as detailed in the table below:
  
Play | Net Acres | | % Producing | | % Leased But Not Producing | | % Unleased | 
-------------------+-----------+---------+-------------+-----+----------------------------+-----+------------+----
SCOOP/STACK | | 11,171 | | 62% | | 13% | | 25%
Bakken/Three Forks | | 3,095 | | 90% | | 0% | | 10%
Arkoma Stack | | 11,592 | | 64% | | 2% | | 34%
Permian | | 39,275 | | 10% | | 14% | | 76%
Fayetteville | | 9,903 | | 72% | | 0% | | 28%
Eagle Ford | | - | | 0% | | 0% | | 0% 
Other | | 183,195 | | 18% | | 3% | | 79%
Total: | | 258,231 | | 24% | | 5% | | 71%

 Approximately 71% of our net mineral position is currently unleased, providing us the opportunity to generate additional cash flow from bonus payments and royalties without spending additional capital. We also own leases on 17,199 net acres primarily in Oklahoma and working interests, royalty interests or both, in 6,496 producing oil and natural gas wells and 120 wells in the process of being drilled or completed. 
 Exploration and development of our oil and natural gas properties are conducted by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, primarily larger independent operating companies. We do not operate any of our oil and natural gas properties. While we previously have been an active working interest participant for many years in wells drilled on the Company’s mineral and leasehold acreage, our current focus is on growth through mineral acquisitions and through development of our significant mineral acreage inventory in our core areas of focus.
 We intend to maximize value to our stockholders through the acquisition of mineral acreage, in the cores of resource plays, with substantial undeveloped opportunities; divestiture of non-core minerals with limited optionality when the amount negotiated exceeds our projected total value; and aggressive leasing of our mineral holdings.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our principal business objective is to maximize value to our stockholders. At the end of 2019, the Company made the strategic decision to cease taking any working interest positions on its mineral and leasehold acreage going forward. The Company has decided to focus on growth through mineral acquisitions and through development of its significant mineral acreage inventory in its core areas of focus. The Company believes that this is the best path to giving our stockholders the greatest risk-weighted returns on their investments going forward. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following corporate strategies:

• | Manage Mineral and Leasehold Assets as a Portfolio to Maximize Value. We plan to manage our mineral and leasehold assets through the following:

Our Business Strengths
 We believe the following attributes position Panhandle to achieve its objectives:
  
• | Focused on Perpetual Mineral Fee Ownership. Our strategic decision to focus on mineral ownership provides us with the perpetual option to benefit from future development and technology. We are focused on generating meaningful revenues through lease bonuses and royalty interests and these revenues have been a growing proportion of our total revenues when compared to our working interests. We owned approximately 258,231 net mineral acres as of September 30, 2019, held principally in Oklahoma, North Dakota, Texas, Arkansas and New Mexico. We also held leases on 17,199 net acres primarily in Oklahoma; and working interests, royalty interests, or both, in 6,496 producing oil and natural gas wells and 120 wells in the process of being drilled or completed.

• | Mineral and Leasehold Ownership in Multiple Top-Tier Resource Plays. We own mineral and leasehold interests in multiple top-tier resource plays in the United States, including positions in the SCOOP/STACK, Bakken/Three Forks, Arkoma Woodford, Eagle Ford, Permian Basin and Fayetteville plays. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from the production and sale of oil, NGL and natural gas from these positions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, production on our acreage was 28,382 Mcfed with approximately 19%, 13% and 68% being derived from oil, NGL and natural gas, respectively.

Principal Products and Markets
 The Company derives revenue through its bonus and royalty payments and from working interests on its mineral and leasehold acreage. The Company’s principal products from the production associated with its non-operated interests, in order of revenue generated, are crude oil, natural gas and NGL. These products are generally sold by our well operators to various purchasers, including pipeline and marketing companies, which service the areas where the Company’s producing wells are located. Since the Company does not operate any of the wells in which it owns an interest, it relies on the operating expertise of numerous companies that operate wells in which the Company owns interests. This includes expertise in the drilling and completion of new wells, producing well operations and, in most cases, the marketing or purchasing of production from the wells. Oil, NGL and natural gas sales are principally handled by the well operator. Payment for oil, NGL and natural gas sold is received by the Company from the well operator or the contracted purchaser. 
 Prices of oil, NGL and natural gas are dependent on numerous factors beyond the Company’s control, including supply and demand, competition, weather, international events and circumstances, actions taken by OPEC and economic, political and regulatory developments. Since demand for natural gas is subject to weather conditions, prices received for the Company’s natural gas production may be subject to seasonal variations. 
 The Company enters into price risk management financial instruments (derivatives) to reduce the Company’s exposure to short-term fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas and protect its return on investments. The derivative contracts apply only to a portion of the Company’s oil and natural gas production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices. These derivative contracts expose the Company to risk of financial loss and may limit the benefit of future increases in oil and natural gas prices. Please read Item 7A – “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and Note 1 to the financial statements included in Item 8 – “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding the derivative contracts entered into by the Company.

Competitive Business Conditions
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive, particularly in the search for new fee mineral interests and oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. Many factors beyond its control affect Panhandle’s competitive position. Some of these factors include: the quantity and price of foreign oil imports; domestic supply and deliverability of oil, NGL and natural gas; changes in prices received for oil, NGL and natural gas production; business and consumer demand for refined oil products, NGL and natural gas; and the effects of federal, state and local regulation of the exploration for, production of and sales of oil, NGL and natural gas (see Item 1A – “Risk Factors”). Many companies have substantially greater resources than we have, and such companies may have more resources to evaluate, bid for and purchase more mineral fee, royalty and similar interests than our financial or human resources permit.
  The Company does not operate any of the wells in which it has an interest; rather, it relies on companies with greater resources, staff, equipment, research and experience for operation of wells in both the drilling and production phases. The Company’s business strategy is to use its strong financial base and its mineral and leasehold acreage ownership, coupled with its own geologic and economic evaluations, to lease or farmout its mineral or leasehold acreage while retaining a royalty interest and to acquire new mineral acreage. We believe this strategy allows the Company to compete effectively in a competitive mineral market; however, our ability to acquire additional mineral fee, royalty and similar interests in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
 Major Customers
 The Company’s oil, NGL and natural gas production is sold, in most cases, through our lessees or well operators to numerous different purchasers. 
 Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
 General
 As the owner of mineral fee interests and non-operating working interests, we do not have any employees or contractors in the field and we are not directly subject to many of the regulations of the oil and gas industry. The following disclosure describes regulations and environmental matters more directly associated with operators of oil and natural gas properties, including our current operators. Since the Company does not operate any wells in which it owns an interest, actual compliance with many laws and regulations is controlled by the well operators, with Panhandle being responsible only for its proportionate share of the costs, if any, involved on wells in which it owns a working interest.
 Oil and natural gas operations are subject to various types of legislation, regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities. Legislation and regulation affecting the entire oil and natural gas industry is continuously being reviewed for potential revision. Some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply.

Although we are generally not directly subject to many of the rules, regulations and limitations impacting the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry as whole, the operators who operate on our properties may be impacted by such rules and regulations and we may be responsible for our proportionate share of costs for wells on which we own a working interest. While this may provide the Company with some insulation from compliance costs applicable to our operator-lessees, we may still be indirectly impacted by operator regulations because our revenue stream depends on operators and the production of oil, NGL and natural gas.
 Regulation of Drilling and Production
 The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under federal, state and local statutes, rules, orders and regulations. These statutes and regulations require that operators obtain permits for drilling operations and drilling bonds, as well as require reports concerning operations. Additionally, states where we own mineral and leasehold interests have enacted regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced from wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which can be drilled. Additionally, some states where we hold mineral or leasehold interests may impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGL and natural gas within its jurisdiction.
 Regulation of Transportation of Oil
 The sale and transportation of our crude oil is generally undertaken by the operators (or by third parties at the direction of the operators) of our properties. Sales of crude oil, condensate and NGL are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices; however, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
 Sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by pro-rationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. 
 Regulation of Transportation and Sale of Natural Gas
 The sale and transportation of our natural gas is generally undertaken by the operators (or by third parties at the direction of the operators) of our properties. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to the 
 6


Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and regulations issued under those Acts by the FERC. In the past, the federal government regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
 The FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. The FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. Although the FERC’s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.
 Intrastate natural gas transportation is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state.
 Environmental Compliance and Risks
 Our operators and properties are impacted by extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and relating to safety and health.
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Historically, most of the environmental regulation of oil and gas production has been left to state regulatory boards or agencies in those jurisdictions where there is significant oil and natural gas production, with limited direct regulation by such federal agencies as the Environmental Protection Agency. However, there are various regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other governmental agencies that would govern significant spills, blow-outs or uncontrolled emissions.
 Many states, including states where we own properties have enacted oil and natural gas regulations that apply to the drilling, completion and operations of wells and the disposal of waste oil and salt water. The operators of our properties are subject to such regulations. There are also procedures incident to the plugging and abandonment of dry holes or other non-operational wells, all as governed by the applicable governing state agency.
 At the federal level, among the more significant laws and regulations that may affect our business and the oil and natural gas industry are: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, also known as “CERCLA” or “Superfund; the Oil Pollution Act of 1990; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, also known as “RCRA,”; 
 7


the Clean Air Act; Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or the Clean Water Act; and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.
 Since the Company does not operate any wells in which it owns an interest, actual compliance with environmental laws is controlled by the well operators, with Panhandle being responsible for its proportionate share of the costs involved on wells that we own a working interest. As such, the Company has no knowledge of any instances of non-compliance with existing laws and regulations. The Company maintains insurance coverage at levels which are customary in the industry, but is not fully insured against all environmental risks.
Taxes
 The Company’s oil and natural gas properties are subject to various taxes, such as gross production taxes and, in some cases, ad valorem taxes. The Company pays ad valorem taxes on minerals owned in ten states.
Employees
 At September 30, 2019, Panhandle employed 22 persons. In addition to serving as the Interim Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Chad Stephens, also serves as a director of the Company.
