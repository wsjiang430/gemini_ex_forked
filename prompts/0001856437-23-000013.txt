ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
Victoria's Secret & Co. (together with its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is a specialty retailer of women's intimate and other apparel and beauty products marketed under the Victoria's Secret, PINK and Adore Me brand names. We have more than 910 stores in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and China, as well as our own websites, www.VictoriasSecret.com, www.PINK.com and www.AdoreMe.com and other online channels worldwide. Additionally, we have approximately 450 stores in approximately 70 countries operating under franchise, license and wholesale arrangements. The Company also includes the merchandise sourcing and production function serving us and our international partners. We operate as a single segment designed to seamlessly serve customers worldwide through stores and online channels.
On November 1, 2022, we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) to acquire 100% of AdoreMe, Inc. (“Adore Me”), a digitally-native intimates brand. On December 30, 2022, the acquisition was completed pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. For additional information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
Our Brands
Our business operates two category-defining intimates and beauty brands, Victoria's Secret and PINK, that share a common purpose of inspiring and uplifting our customers in every stage of their lives, and Adore Me, a technology-led, digital-first innovative intimates brand serving women of all sizes and budgets at all phases of life. We offer a range of products across intimate apparel, sleepwear, loungewear, swimwear and beauty.
Victoria’s Secret
Victoria’s Secret is a leading lingerie brand, with an established history of over 45 years. The Victoria’s Secret brand celebrates female confidence and inspires women with beautiful products and experiences. Victoria’s Secret offers bras, panties, lingerie, sleepwear, loungewear, sport and swim products across its global retail locations and its online e-commerce channel. Bras and panties represent the two largest categories for Victoria’s Secret. We believe our assortment is differentiated by our focus on fit, comfort and quality.
PINK
PINK is a lifestyle brand that is focused on celebrating and supporting diversity, equity, inclusion, self-confidence and individuality. The brand focuses on a collegiate-oriented customer. Our products are designed to make customers feel good both inside and out, and include bras, panties, active wear, loungewear, accessories and swimwear, with bras and apparel representing the two largest categories. PINK is sold across North America and internationally at Victoria’s Secret and PINK retail stores and online.
Victoria’s Secret Beauty
Victoria’s Secret Beauty expands our offering and enhances our emotional connection to our customers. To complement the core Victoria’s Secret offering, the Company launched its first fragrance line in 1991. Today, the Victoria’s Secret Beauty business has grown to be one of the leading fragrance brands in America. Beauty products include fine fragrance, mists, PINK Beauty products and accessories. Products are sold at Victoria’s Secret specialty retail stores and online.
Adore Me
Adore Me is a direct-to-consumer lingerie and apparel brand that is focused on serving women of all sizes and budgets at all phases of life. Founded in 2011 as an online lingerie startup, Adore Me is transforming the way customers shop with a pioneering home try-on commerce service, a series of innovation-driven products and a mission of making sustainable shopping accessible to all. Adore Me is sold online and in Adore Me's six retail stores.
Victoria's Secret & Co. Spin-Off
On July 9, 2021, L Brands, Inc. (“L Brands” or the “Former Parent”) announced that its Board of Directors approved the previously announced separation of the Victoria's Secret business, including PINK, into an independent, publicly traded company (the “Separation”). Prior to the Separation, L Brands operated the Bath & Body Works, Victoria’s Secret and PINK retail brands.
Table of Contents

On August 2, 2021 (the “Distribution Date”), after the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) market closing, the Separation of the Victoria's Secret business was completed. On August 3, 2021, Victoria's Secret & Co. became an independent, publicly-traded company trading on the NYSE under the stock symbol “VSCO.”
The Separation was achieved through the Former Parent’s distribution (the “Distribution”) of 100% of the shares of our common stock to holders of the Former Parent's common stock as of the close of business on the record date of July 22, 2021. The Former Parent's stockholders of record received one share of our common stock for every three shares of the Former Parent's common stock. In connection with the Separation, we made a cash payment of approximately $976 million to the Former Parent on August 2, 2021 from the issuances of certain debt (discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). The Former Parent retained no ownership interest in us following the Separation.
We entered into several agreements with the Former Parent that, among other things, effect the Separation and govern the relationship of the parties following the Separation, including a Separation and Distribution Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement, an L Brands to VS Transition Services Agreement, a VS to L Brands Transition Services Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement and a Domestic Transportation Services Agreement. For additional information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Joint Venture Partnerships
Victoria's Secret China
In April 2022, we announced the completion of the joint venture agreement with Regina Miracle International (Holdings) Limited (“Regina Miracle”), a company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, related to our existing Company-owned business in China. We formed a joint venture with Regina Miracle to operate Victoria's Secret stores and the related online business in China. Under the terms of the agreement, we own 51% of the joint venture and Regina Miracle owns the remaining 49%. Since we have retained control over the joint venture, the joint venture's assets, liabilities and results of operations continue to be consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. For additional information, see Note 6 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Victoria's Secret U.K.
Due to challenging business results for our business in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), we entered into administration in June 2020 to restructure store lease agreements and reduce operating losses in the U.K. business. In October 2020, we entered into a joint venture with Next PLC (“Next”) for the business in the U.K. and Ireland. Under this agreement, we own 49% of the joint venture, and Next owns 51% and is responsible for operations. We account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. For additional information, see Note 6 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Impacts of Macroeconomic Environment
Our operations and financial performance have been adversely impacted by deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and globally, which were caused in part by the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”). The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by record-high inflation, supply chain challenges, labor shortages, high interest rates, volatility in global capital markets and growing recession risk. Such macroeconomic conditions have and could continue to adversely affect our business, for example, by reducing consumer demand for our products and leading to decreased sales.
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. As used herein, “2022,” “2021” and “2020” refer to the 52-week periods ended January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively.
Historically, Adore Me's fiscal year ended on December 31. As a result of our acquisition of Adore Me on December 30, 2022, Adore Me's financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements. Due to the timing and availability of financial information of Adore Me, we consolidate Adore Me's financial information on an approximate one-month reporting lag. 
Real Estate
Company-operated, China Joint Venture and Adore Me Retail Stores
Our company-operated Victoria's Secret and PINK, China joint venture and Adore Me retail stores are located in shopping malls, lifestyle centers and off-mall locations in the U.S., Canada and China. As a result of our strong brands and established retail presence, we have been able to lease high-traffic locations in most retail centers in which we operate.

Franchise, License and Wholesale Arrangements
In addition to our Company-operated stores, our products are sold at hundreds of partner locations and on partner websites in approximately 70 countries. We are focused on ensuring our partners have the commitment and capability to provide a quality customer experience and to grow our brands internationally.
Under the terms of our franchise, license and wholesale arrangements, we provide our partners the rights to sell our products in various geographic regions along with operational policies and standards governing such matters as the supply and sale of our products, in stores and online, marketing and store training. Our partners are generally responsible for providing the capital necessary to lease retail space, build-out stores and/or develop websites, fund the operations of the business, and over the longer-term, reinvest in the business. Our partners are also responsible for the day-to-day operations of the business, and must do so in accordance with our policies and standards which are focused on ensuring a consistent customer experience around the world. Such arrangements can typically be terminated, upon delivery of notice, in the event of any breach of representations or warranties.
Our franchise and license arrangements with our partners typically have an initial term of five to ten years, with an option to renew, subject to customary conditions. Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers, typically based on a percentage of sales. Royalty rates, which generally range from low double digits to mid-teens, vary based on store format, local business conditions and various other factors.
Our wholesale arrangements with our partners typically have an initial term of five years, with an option to renew, subject to customary conditions. Wholesale prices, which vary by product category, are generally based on a discount to the suggested retail price. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths contribute to our leading market position, differentiate us from our competitors and will drive future growth:
Two Category-Defining Brands with Global Brand Awareness and Resonance
Our Victoria's Secret and PINK brands have a strong global presence and awareness among consumers, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. We also have Adore Me, a technology-led, digital first innovative intimates brand which we believe is transforming the way customers shop with a pioneering home try-on commerce service and a series of innovation-driven products. While our history runs deep as a dominant player in intimates, our brands also provide compelling offerings in fragrance, beauty, apparel, loungewear, sleepwear, athletic attire and swimwear. We believe our actions to evolve our positioning and promote inclusivity and diversity will allow us to attract new customers while also deepening our connection with existing ones. Through social, cultural and business relationships, The VS Collective, a diverse group of women ambassadors, works to create new associate programs, revolutionary product collections, compelling and inspiring content, and rally support for causes vital to women. The Victoria’s Secret Global Fund for Women’s Cancers funds innovative research projects aimed at progressing treatments and cures for women’s cancers and investing in the next generation of women scientists who represent the diverse population they serve. We are focused on fueling our customer’s desire to be herself by empowering her with products that not only offer her comfort and style, but also allow her to celebrate and express her true self.
Global Scale at Retail
We believe we have significant scale and strength in reaching our consumer base. We interact with our customers through three powerful distribution channels:
•Digital. Our digital business allows for an interconnected customer experience across our brands and platforms. We seek to deliver a differentiated digital experience through seamless and personalized touchpoints. Importantly, we are focused on developing our social media platforms and websites, applications with personalized digital marketing campaigns, advanced omni-channel offerings and improved store and website inventory connectivity.
•North American Stores. Our retail footprint in North America spans the U.S. and Canada with 843 stores, representing a combined 5.9 million square feet of selling space as of the end of 2022. Our North American stores channel creates an immersive environment for customers to experience our brands and try new products. Our sales associates and store managers are central in creating an engaging and compelling store experience by providing a high level of customer service. 
•International. We have a significant international footprint with 515 international stores and 45 international digital sites as of the end of 2022. We believe we have meaningful opportunity to grow through new beauty and accessories and full assortment stores, new digital sites and new geographies. Our beauty and accessories stores represent smaller footprint stores including stores in airports and other travel retail locations, which enable significant global exposure. Our international stores span the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East, in addition to the strong digital component of our international business.
Agile and Highly Responsive Supply Chain and Sourcing Capabilities
Our sourcing and production function has a long and deep presence in key sourcing markets including those in the U.S. and Asia. Our intimates and apparel categories are supported by an internationally outsourced platform, primarily in Asia, which has consistently provided rapid speed to market, high quality and innovative products and an efficient cost base. Meanwhile, our beauty platform is largely centered in Ohio, where a number of our suppliers are located, boasting innovation and agile manufacturing. We have thoughtfully designed our supply chain around three key principles: speed-to-market, quality and cost efficiency.
Table of Contents

When possible we leverage the speed that we have in our supply chain, our close partnerships with suppliers and the capabilities of our sourcing, production and logistics teams to actively manage our inventory and adjust for channel shifts across our business. We focus on speed to market and believe our lead times are amongst the shortest in the industry, allowing us to read and react to customer preferences. The agility within our supply chain provides us with flexibility to quickly re-order strong sellers as we seek to maximize our sales and merchandise margin rate opportunities.
Our strong relationships with our suppliers have allowed us to manufacture our products with cost efficiency without sacrificing quality. Our global supply base and flexibility are key competitive advantages and allow us to provide a broad product range, innovation and assortment to our customers.
We remain focused on maximizing our strong relationships with our supplier partners and our sourcing and logistics capabilities to help mitigate any supply chain challenges and cost pressures on our business.
Highly-Talented Management Team with Deep Industry Experience
Our senior management team has a wealth of retail and business experience and a deep knowledge of our business. The management team is supported by well qualified leaders and is highly collaborative across our brands and our channels.
Distribution Channels
Our distribution channels include digital, North American stores and international stores. We utilize these channels to reach our consumers in the physical and digital locations they frequent within their geographies.
Digital
The digital channel accounted for $1.843 billion, or 29%, of our revenues in 2022. The channel includes sales that are derived from our websites and mobile applications.
Our digital presence, including social media, our websites and our mobile applications, allows us to get to know our customers better and communicate with them anytime and anywhere. Our digital customers engage in more transactions relative to non-digital customers. Within digital, we have taken a mobile-first approach to help drive sales.
We have taken steps to modernize the digital platform, including the use of artificial intelligence-driven chatbots and geo-targeted digital marketing. Our digital platform is designed to further support our physical presence and contribute to the growth of omni-channel sales.
North American Stores
The North American stores channel represents the stores in our North American physical retail locations and accounted for $3.909 billion, or 62%, of our revenues in 2022. We operate 843 physical locations as of the end of 2022, including a range of full assortment stores, Victoria’s Secret Lingerie stores, free-standing PINK stores and free-standing Adore Me stores.
We are investing in our physical stores by refreshing existing stores and utilizing a store of the future concept that includes smaller, more flexible space in off-mall locations with a unique dual-brand layout to meet the needs of our customer and accommodate shifting consumer preferences for omni-channel shopping. We continue to right-size our stores to optimize our physical retail footprint and enable omni-channel sales. Additionally, we are investing in our people through field talent and leadership development to optimize the customer experience.
International
The international channel represents our stores and websites in China as well as royalty and wholesale sales related to the stores and websites operated by our franchise, license, wholesale and joint venture partners. International net sales accounted for $592 million, or 9%, of our revenues in 2022. As of the end of 2022, we have 72 joint venture-operated stores in China as well as 443 partner-operated stores around the world, including locations across the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner. We continue to increase the number of locations under these types of arrangements as part of our international expansion.

Additional Information
Merchandise Vendors
During 2022, we purchased merchandise from approximately 210 vendors located throughout the world, the largest of which accounted for approximately 14% of our purchases. We believe there are numerous alternative suppliers for our merchandise and that the loss of any one vendor would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
Design, Product Development and Sourcing
Our product design and innovation is an important component of our strategy. We achieve success through frequent and fashionable product launches across product categories with a focus on fit, fabric, finish, and superior quality. Our merchant, design and sourcing teams have a long history of designing innovative products to meet our customers’ needs. We believe our focus on product development differentiates our offering through superior fit, broad ranges of sizes, and comfortable and appealing silhouettes. Additionally, we believe that our sourcing and production functions, which have a long and deep presence in key sourcing markets including those in the U.S. and Asia, allow us to partner with premier manufacturers to manufacture high-quality products quickly.
Our product development team works with four key design periods for the year: Spring, Summer, Fall and Holiday, that represent our selling seasons. Certain product lines offer more frequent introductions of new merchandise, and the primary selling seasons, Fall and Holiday, often will see greater quantities of introductions for new merchandise. We strive to tailor our buying strategies to align with customer demand and trends across our core categories with agile and fast lead times.
Our global supply chain organization is responsible for the operational planning, manufacturing, sourcing, and distribution of products to our customers. We believe we have developed a high degree of expertise in managing the complexities associated with a global supply chain.
Distribution and Merchandise
A substantial portion of our merchandise is shipped to our distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio area. Additionally, we use third-party operated distribution centers located throughout North America to distribute our merchandise. We use a variety of shipping terms that result in the transfer of title of the merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination.
Our policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventories on hand in our retail stores and distribution centers to enable us to offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. We emphasize rapid turnover and take markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current.
We remain focused on maximizing our strong relationships with our supplier partners and our sourcing and logistics capabilities to help mitigate any supply chain challenges and cost pressures on our business.
Advertising and Customer Support
Our brand marketing and advertising efforts are focused on highlighting our products’ fashion, innovative design and quality while also accentuating our brands’ positioning in the broader market and changing landscape. We have shifted the focus of our global message across platforms towards promoting inclusivity and highlighting our products through an empowering, relatable, fresh brand voice to align with our customers’ values. Our marketing strategies are designed to drive brand awareness and create continued loyalty between our customers and our brands. We also find it important to cater messaging towards different geographic and cultural preferences and customs in order to better connect with our customers. We are committed to evolving our brand projection to serve our consumer and are developing a number of initiatives to continue that evolution through traditional media, entertainment platforms, and community-driven forums. We pursue our marketing strategy across a variety of platforms to reach our omni-channel customers, both in-store and online. We use traditional media outlets such as print, as well as digital media channels including social media, paid search and influencers. We have a dedicated team focused on marketing analytics to help ensure our advertising and promotional investments are providing effective returns.
Our e-commerce channel and store locations also provide customers with an enhanced understanding of our brands through uniform messaging and brand essence across platforms. Each brand has a marketing team focused on ensuring the customer is appropriately reached and engaged. Our in-store sales force is also highly knowledgeable and we have regular in-store training to promote positive customer interactions through helpful and informed store associates.
Information Systems
Our management information systems consist of a full range of retail, financial and merchandising systems. The systems include applications related to point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management, data security and support systems including human resources and finance. 
Table of Contents

Seasonal Business
Our operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth quarters). The fourth quarter, including the holiday season, typically accounts for approximately one-third of our net sales and is normally our most profitable quarter. Accordingly, cash requirements are routinely highest in the third quarter as our inventories build in advance of the holiday season. 
Working Capital 
We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs and investment opportunities. 
Regulations
We and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. We are subject to a variety of tax and customs regulations and international trade arrangements. While there are no current regulatory matters that we expect to be material to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows, there can be no assurances that existing or future laws, regulations and standards applicable to our operations or products will not lead to a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Intellectual Property
Our trademarks and patents, which constitute our primary intellectual property, have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries where our products are manufactured and/or sold. We believe our products are identified by our trademarks and, thus, our trademarks are of significant value. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our trademarks and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement, misappropriation or other violations. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, in general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed.
We also place high importance on product innovation and design, and a number of these innovations and designs are the subject of issued patents and pending patent applications.
Due to the worldwide consumer recognition of our products, we face an increased risk of counterfeiting by third parties. We vigorously monitor and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights against counterfeiting, infringement, misappropriation and other violations by third parties where and to the extent legal, feasible and appropriate. However, the actions we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent third parties from copying our products or infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our trademarks or other intellectual property rights, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S.
Other Information
For additional information about our business, including our net sales and profits for the last three years and selling square footage, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
Competition
The sale of women’s intimates, apparel, and personal and beauty care products is a highly competitive business. We believe we compete effectively in our core categories by leveraging our brand equity, unique scale and our high-quality innovative products. Our primary competitors include individual and chain specialty stores, department stores, mass merchandisers, online retailers and discount retailers. Additionally, we see a large and growing offering from private label intimates apparel created for retailers in addition to emerging brands. Brand image, presentation, marketing, design, price, service, fulfillment, assortment, fit and quality are the principal competitive factors.
Human Capital Management
We believe the way we view human capital management is a strength, and we are committed to continuing to build a responsible and inclusive business based on uncompromising transparency, fairness, diversity, and integrity, consistent with our Company values.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) are key components of our culture and fundamental in achieving our strategic priorities and goals. At Victoria's Secret & Co., our DEI vision is to celebrate, honor and reflect the diversity of our customers, our associates and the communities we engage.

For us, it is not just about selling products it is about using our scale and platform to champion every voice and drive forward inclusion and equity for every individual.

Associate Engagement and Well-Being
Associate engagement and well-being are key components of our culture and fundamental in achieving our strategic priorities and goals.
Culture
We are committed to associate engagement by striving to foster a happy, healthy and inclusive culture where everyone can bring their whole selves to work. At Victoria's Secret & Co., our purpose goes beyond selling product. We strive to provide a community of smart, passionate and dedicated associates whose creativity, innovation and hard work fuel the world’s most recognized lingerie, apparel and beauty brand. We also strive to provide a community in which all associates are treated fairly and respectfully, with equal access to opportunities and resources, allowing associates to contribute fully to our success. As our world evolves, we evolve with it by embracing social change, taking action, and holding ourselves accountable for creating a happy, healthy and safe place to work.
We are focused on retaining, recruiting and advancing talent that reflects the customers we serve and the communities where we live and work. By encouraging a workplace environment where diversity, equity and inclusion are valued, we believe we can serve our customers better, as well as retain highly talented associates, suppliers and vendors of different backgrounds and experiences.
In addition, we maintain an Ethics Hotline where associates may anonymously report potential instances of unethical conduct and potential violations of law or company policies 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We have a written Code of Conduct that is based on our values and provides a resource where associates can find information that defines behaviors that are acceptable and those that are not. We conduct an annual Code of Conduct compliance process which requires associates to certify that they have read and agree to abide by the Code of Conduct and to complete a separate training course.

We offer competitive compensation, company-matched savings and contributions to the retirement plan, and flexible and affordable health, wellness and lifestyle benefits to eligible associates. Eligible associates can choose benefits and access resources that fit their lifestyle, including, but not limited to, 14 weeks paid maternity leave, 6 weeks paid paternity leave, adoption assistance, tuition reimbursement, free access to life planning and health advocate services and generous merchandise discounts. We also recently extended a worldwide Employee Assistance Program for all associates and anyone in their household to support mental health well-being. In addition, we offer paid time off to eligible part-time associates.
We are committed to equal opportunity and treatment for all associates which includes equal career advancement opportunities and equitable and competitive wages. Our compensation programs are designed to link annual changes in compensation to Victoria's Secret & Co.'s overall performance. At the individual level, we strive to assess performance on both an associate's contributions as well as behaviors displayed to achieve them. The emphasis on Victoria's Secret & Co.'s overall performance is intended to align our associates’ financial interests with the interests of our stockholders. All salaried associates in the home office, distribution and call centers participate in our short-term cash incentive program. We encourage associate stock ownership with the ability to purchase Victoria's Secret & Co. shares at a discount through our associate stock purchase plan.
Ensuring Equal Pay for Equal Work
The heart of our business is our talented workforce. We offer competitive pay and benefits to our more than 30,000 associates around the world and pay all associates equitably regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or background. 
We conduct an annual, rigorous and transparent review of 100% of our worldwide workforce that is verified by an independent third party to ensure that all salaries and incentive compensation targets are fair and unbiased. If we find any differences in pay between men and women globally or by race and ethnicity in the United States, we make upward adjustments. Our process reviews gender, race, ethnicity and the intersection of these identities. (Many jurisdictions outside the U.S. limit our ability to collect information on race and ethnicity and also what we can do with that information.)
Because workforces are dynamic and ever-changing, so is the work to ensure pay equity. We believe that pay equity is a journey, not a destination. Victoria's Secret & Co. engages in an ongoing analysis and is committed to continued transparency relative to our metrics on pay equity, and we plan to report to our associates and to the public on an annual basis.
Health and Safety
Health and safety of our associates, customers and vendors are key components of our culture and fundamental in achieving our strategic priorities and goals. We strive to provide safe and clean facilities, comply with all applicable workplace safety laws and have global safety policies and procedures to protect from avoidable injury.
Model Engagement and Photo Shoot Compliance
At Victoria's Secret & Co., our values define who we are and what we stand for, including treating everyone with dignity and respect. To support these values, we have established compliance processes and protocols which apply to all Victoria's Secret & Co. associates and third parties participating in photo shoots, public relations events, fit sessions and other internal meetings where models are present.
Our Global Ethics and Compliance team is responsible for the day-to-day administration and management of the model engagement and photo shoot compliance protocols. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, executing certain compliance processes related to the Photo Shoot Procedures and Fit Session Protocol, training new and existing associates, and escalating allegations of misconduct for investigation by the appropriate teams. For photo shoots, all external crew is required to certify to the Victoria's Secret & Co.
