 Bone Growth Therapies
 The Bone Growth Therapies reporting segment manufactures, distributes, and provides support services for market-leading bone growth stimulation devices that enhance bone fusion. These class III medical devices are indicated as an adjunctive, noninvasive treatment to improve fusion success rates in the cervical and lumbar spine as well as a therapeutic treatment for non-spinal, appendicular fractures that have not healed (nonunions). These devices utilize Orthofix’s patented pulsed electromagnetic field (“PEMF”) technology, the safety and efficacy of which is supported by basic mechanism of action data in the scientific literature as well as published data from level one randomized controlled clinical trials. The devices are compatible with the STIM onTrack mobile application, which includes a first-to-market feature that enables physicians to remotely view and assess patient adherence to treatment protocols. We currently have research and a clinical study underway to identify potential clinical indications for treating rotator cuff tears. We sell this reporting segment’s products almost exclusively in the U.S. using distributors and direct sales representatives to sell and deliver our devices to hospitals, healthcare providers, and patients.
Bone Growth Therapies Strategy
 Our strategy for the Bone Growth Therapies reporting segment is to expand patient access to bone growth therapy devices that deliver noninvasive treatment for promoting healing in fractured bones and spinal fusions. Our key strategies in this segment are:

• | Promote competitive advantages of our recently launched products and STIM onTrack mobile app
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Support adoption and reimbursement with:
--+-----------------------------------------


o | North American Spine Society’s (NASS) Coverage Policy Recommendation

Bone Growth Therapies Products
 The following table and discussion identify our principal Bone Growth Therapies products by trade name and describe their primary applications: 
 
 
Product | Primary Application 
-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CervicalStim Spinal Fusion Therapy | PEMF non-invasive cervical spinal fusion therapy used to enhance bone growth 
SpinalStim Spinal Fusion Therapy | PEMF non-invasive lumbar spinal fusion therapy used to enhance bone growth 
PhysioStim Bone Healing Therapy | PEMF non-invasive appendicular skeleton healing therapy used to enhance bone growth in nonunion fractures

Spinal Therapy
 Our bone growth therapy devices used in spinal applications are designed to enhance bone growth and the success rate of certain spinal fusions by stimulating the body’s own natural healing mechanism post-surgically. These non-invasive portable devices are intended to be used as part of a home treatment program prescribed by a physician. 
 We offer two spinal fusion therapy devices: the SpinalStim and CervicalStim devices. Our stimulation products use a PEMF technology designed to enhance the growth of bone tissue following surgery and are placed externally over the site to be healed. Research data shows that our PEMF signal induces mineralization and results in a process that stimulates new regeneration at the spinal fusion site. Some spine fusion patients are at greater risk of not achieving a solid fusion of new bone around the fusion site. These patients typically have one or more risk factors such as smoking, obesity or diabetes, or their surgery involves the revision of a failed fusion or the fusion of multiple levels of vertebrae in one procedure. For these patients, post-surgical bone growth therapy has been shown to significantly increase the probability of fusion success.
 The SpinalStim device is a non-invasive spinal fusion stimulator system that has been commercially available in the U.S. since 1990. It is designed for the treatment of the lumbar region of the spine. The device uses proprietary technology and a wavelength to generate a PEMF signal. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has approved the SpinalStim system as a spinal fusion adjunct to increase the probability of fusion success and as a non-operative treatment for salvage of failed spinal fusion at least nine months post-operatively. 
 Our CervicalStim product remains the only FDA-approved bone growth stimulator on the market indicated for use as an adjunct to cervical spine fusion surgery in patients at high-risk for non-fusion. The FDA approved this device in 2004, and it has been commercially available in the U.S. since 2005. 
 In late 2016, the North American Spine Society (“NASS”) issued first-of-its-kind coverage recommendations for electrical bone growth stimulators. These evidence-based coverage policy recommendations support the use of PEMF devices as an adjunct to spinal fusion surgery in high-risk patients. The NASS coverage policy recommends coverage of the use of electrical stimulation for spinal fusion healing in all regions of the spine, including cervical and lumbar regions. The validation of PEMF electrical stimulation from this leading surgical society has and is expected to continue to further support our efforts to expand the availability and use of the therapy to the many patients who can benefit from it. 
 In January 2017, we announced FDA and European Commission CE mark approval for our next-generation SpinalStim and CervicalStim bone growth stimulators. The CervicalStim and SpinalStim systems available in the U.S. are accompanied by a new application for mobile devices called STIM onTrack. The mobile app includes a first-to-market feature that enables physicians to remotely view how their patients are adhering to prescribed treatment protocols. Designed for use with smartphones and other mobile devices, the STIM onTrack tool helps patients follow their prescription with daily treatment reminders and a device usage calendar. The app is free and available through the iTunes App Store. In addition to the app, the next-generation bone growth stimulators include patient enhancements aimed at improving fit, comfort and ease of use.
 Orthopedic Therapy 
 Our PhysioStim bone healing therapy products use PEMF technology similar to that used in our spine stimulators. The primary difference is that the PhysioStim devices are designed for use on the appendicular skeleton.

A bone’s regenerative power results in most fractures healing naturally within a few months. In the presence of certain risk factors, however, some fractures do not heal or heal slowly, resulting in “nonunions.” Traditionally, orthopedists have treated such fracture conditions surgically, often by means of a bone graft with fracture fixation devices, such as bone plates, screws or intramedullary rods. These are examples of “invasive” treatments. Our patented PhysioStim bone healing therapy products are designed to use a low level of PEMF signals to noninvasively activate the body’s natural healing process. The devices are anatomically designed, allowing ease of placement, patient mobility, and the ability to cover a large treatment area. 
 In March 2018, we announced the FDA and European Commission CE mark approval for our next-generation PhysioStim bone growth stimulator. Similar to the next-generation CervicalStim and SpinalStim systems, the PhysioStim device is also accompanied by the STIM onTrack mobile app, enabling physicians treating patients with nonunion fractures to remotely view and assess how their patients are adhering to prescribed treatment protocols. In addition to the app, the next-generation PhysioStim devices also include patient enhancements aimed at improving fit, comfort and ease of use.
 Future Applications
 We have sponsored research at the University of Pennsylvania, Cleveland Clinic, New York University, and University of California San Francisco, where scientists conducted animal and cellular studies to identify the mechanisms of action of our PEMF signals on bone and tendon an efficacy of healing. From these efforts, many studies have been recently published in peer-reviewed journals. Among other insights, the studies illustrate positive effects of PEMF on callus formation and bone strength as well as proliferation and differentiation of cells involved in regeneration and healing. Furthermore, we believe that the research work with Cleveland Clinic and the University of Pennsylvania, allowing for characterization and visualization of the Orthofix PEMF waveform, is paving the way for signal optimization for a variety of new applications and indications. This collection of pre-clinical data, along with additional clinical data, could represent new clinical indication opportunities for our regenerative stimulation solutions.

Motion Preservation Solutions
 On April 30, 2018, we acquired Spinal Kinetics Inc., a privately held developer and manufacturer of artificial cervical and lumbar discs, namely the M6-C Cervical and M6-L Lumbar Artificial Discs, which are used to treat patients suffering from degenerative disc disease of the spine. The M6 discs are the only artificial discs that mimic the anatomic structure of a natural disc by incorporating an artificial viscoelastic nucleus and fiber annulus into their design. Like a natural disc, this unique construct allows for shock absorption at the implanted level, as well as provides a controlled range of motion when the spine transitions in its combined complex movements. Both discs have European Commission CE mark approval and historically have been exclusively distributed outside the U.S. On February 6, 2019, we received FDA approval of the M6-C Artificial Cervical Disc to treat patients with cervical disc degeneration. We expect to release the M6-C Artificial Cervical Disc in 2019 in the U.S. through a controlled, limited market launch accompanied by an extensive training and education curriculum for surgeons.
Spinal Repair Solutions 
 We provide a wide array of implants designed for use primarily in cervical, thoracic and lumbar fusion surgeries. These implants are made of either metal or a thermoplastic compound called PEEK. The majority of the implants that we offer are made of titanium metal. This includes the Cetra, 3°, Reliant and Hallmark cervical plates. Additionally, the Spinal Fixation System, the Firebird Spinal Fixation System, the Phoenix Minimally Invasive Spinal Fixation System, the Ascent, Ascent LE, and the Centurion POCT Systems are sets of rods, cross connectors and screws that are implanted during posterior fusion procedures. The Firebird Modular and pre-assembled Spinal Fixation Systems are designed to be used in either open or minimally-invasive posterior lumbar fusion procedures with our product ProView MAP System. To complement our plates, rods and screw fixation options we offer an entire portfolio of cervical and thoracolumbar PEEK interbody devices within our Pillar and Forza product lines.  This interbody portfolio includes two stand-alone devices, Lonestar and Pillar SA, as well as the Construx Mini PTC system, a novel titanium composite spacer which offers a superior alternative to other plasma spray coated options currently available on the market.  We also offer specialty plates and screws that are used in less common procedures, and as such, are not manufactured by many device makers.Biologics
 The Biologics reporting segment provides a portfolio of regenerative products and tissue forms that allow physicians to successfully treat a variety of spinal and orthopedic conditions. This reporting segment specializes in the marketing of regeneration tissue forms and distributes MTF Biologics (“MTF”) tissues to hospitals and healthcare providers, primarily in the U.S., through a network of employed and independent sales representatives. Our partnership with MTF allows us to exclusively market the Trinity Evolution and Trinity ELITE tissue forms for musculoskeletal defects to enhance bony fusion. 
Biologics Strategy 
 In order to drive further adoption and use of our products, our strategy for the Biologics reporting segment is to educate physicians, both directly and through our sales force, of the surgical and patient benefits of using our portfolio of regenerative tissues and products to augment their surgical procedures and results. Our key strategies in this segment are: 

• | Expand sales force coverage in the spine market and continue to expand into other orthopedic procedures

 Regenerative Solutions 
 The premier biologics tissues we market include the Trinity ELITE and Trinity Evolution tissue forms, which are cortical cancellous allografts that contain viable cells and are used during surgery in the treatment of musculoskeletal defects for bone reconstruction and repair. These allografts are intended to offer a viable alternative to an autograft procedure as harvesting autograft has been shown to add risk of an additional surgical procedure and related patient discomfort in conjunction with a repair surgery. 
 To provide structural support and facilitate bone growth in spine fusion procedures, we offer a full line of AlloQuent allograft structural spacers derived from human cadaveric bone. These spacers are used to restore the height lost between vertebral bodies when discs are removed in fusion procedures and to facilitate spine fusion. 
 We offer the Collage product as an osteoconductive scaffold and a bone graft substitute product. The product is a combination synthetic bone graft substitute comprised of beta tri-calcium phosphate and type 1 bovine collagen. 
 We also market the VersaShield tissue form, a thin hydrophilic amniotic membrane designed to serve as a wound or tissue covering for a variety of surgical demands. Amniotic tissue forms derived from donated human placenta are used in a wide variety of applications and are valued for their healing properties, scar reduction and anti-adhesion characteristics. The VersaShield tissue is derived from the human placental layers amnion and chorion, thin elastic membranes that allow the tissue to conform to the surface of the surgical site.  
 We receive marketing fees through our collaboration with MTF for the Trinity Evolution, Trinity ELITE, and VersaShield tissues. MTF processes the tissues, maintains inventory, and invoices hospitals and surgery centers and other points of care for service fees, which are submitted by customers via purchase orders. We have exclusive worldwide rights to market the Trinity Evolution and Trinity ELITE tissue forms. We market the VersaShield tissue under a private label brand via a non-exclusive marketing agreement for the tissue form. 
 To date, our Biologics products are offered primarily in the U.S. market due in part to restrictions on providing U.S. human donor tissue in other countries.

 We provide internal and external fixation solutions for extremity repair and deformity correction, both for adults and children. Our fracture repair products consist of fixation devices designed to stabilize a broken bone until it can heal. With these devices, we can treat simple and complex fracture patterns along with achieving deformity corrections. 
 External Fixation 
 External fixation devices are used to stabilize fractures and offer an ideal treatment for complex fractures, fractures near the joints and in patients with known risk factors or co-morbidities. The treatment method entails the use of bone screws and/or wires which are inserted percutaneously into the bone and stabilized with an external device. The treatment is minimally invasive and allows external manipulation of the bone to obtain and maintain final bone alignment (reduction). The bone is fixed in this way until healing. External fixation devices may also be used temporarily in complex trauma cases to stabilize the fracture prior to treating it definitively. In these situations, the device offers rapid fracture stabilization, which is important in life saving as well as limb salvage procedures. 
 The Galaxy Fixation System is a modular external fixation system indicated for fracture treatment in the upper and lower limbs. The system incorporates a streamlined combination of clamps, with both pin-to-bar and bar-to-bar coupling capabilities, offering a complete range of applications, including specific anatomic units for the elbow, shoulder and wrist. It is designed both for temporary as well as definitive fracture fixation. It is also available in sterile kits for convenience and ease of use. 
 The XCaliber external fixator, made of lightweight radiolucent material, offers improved X-ray visualization of the fracture and alignment. It is available in three configurations for the treatment of long bone fractures, fractures near joints, and ankle fractures. XCaliber fixators are supplied pre-assembled, ready to use, in sterile kits to decrease time in the operating room.
 The LRS Advanced Limb Reconstruction System uses callus distraction to lengthen bone in a variety of procedures, including monofocal lengthening and corrections of deformity. Its multifocal procedures include bone transport, simultaneous compression and distraction at different sites, bifocal lengthening, and correction of deformities with shortening.
 The TrueLok Ring Fixation System is a surgeon-designed, lightweight external fixation system for limb lengthening and deformity correction. In essence, a ring fixation construct consists of circular rings and semi-circular external supports centered on the patient’s limb and secured to the bone by crossed, tensioned wires and half pins. The rings are connected externally to provide stable bone fixation. The main external connecting elements are threaded rods, linear distractors, or hinges and angular distractors, which allow the surgeon to adjust the relative position of rings to each other. The ring positions are manipulated either acutely or gradually in precise increments to perform the correction of the deformity, limb lengthening, or bone segment transportation as required by the surgeon. Created with pre-assembled function blocks, the TrueLok products are a simple, stable, versatile ring fixation system. 
 12


Building on the TrueLok brand, the TL-HEX TrueLok Hexapod System was released in 2012 in international markets and in 2015 in the U.S. TL-HEX is a hexapod-based system designed at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children as a three-dimensional bone segment reposition module to augment the previously developed TrueLok frame. The system consists of circular and semi-circular external supports secured to the bones by wires and half pins and interconnected by six struts. This allows multi-planar adjustment of the external supports. The rings’ position is adjusted either rapidly or gradually in precise increments to perform bone segment repositioning in three-dimensional space. All the basic components from the TrueLok Ring Fixation System (wire and half pin fixation bolts, posts, threaded rods, plates as well as other assembly components and instrumentation) can be utilized with the TL-HEX system; therefore, external supports from both systems can be connected to each other when building fixation blocks.
 The new addition of HEX-Ray software to the TL-HEX platform allows a unique and realistic representation of the case using real x-rays and providing more accurate and user-friendly management of the surgery. The software is intended to help the surgeon save time by avoiding undesired corrections and mistakes related to software management.
 Linked to the TL and TL-HEX line, we have also developed a patient app to support the patient in the TL-HEX fixator daily management. The patient is an active part in the healing process and the app is designed to improve the communication and connection with the hospital staff by saving time, optimizing the number of visits to the clinic, and supporting the patient with motivational messages and an online tutorial to sort out the most common issues. Also related to the TL and TL-HEX line, but specifically developed for younger patients, we created the Edugame, an online app to help patient learn by playing a virtual game. It has been developed with psychologist involvement in order to deliver useful information in an effective way.
 Our proprietary XCaliber bone screws are designed to be compatible with our external fixators and reduce inventory for our customers. Some of these screws are covered with hydroxyapatite, a mineral component of bone that reduces superficial inflammation of soft tissue and improves bone grip. Other screws in this proprietary line do not include the hydroxyapatite coating, but offer different advantages such as patented thread designs for better adherence in hard or poor quality bone. Adding to the XCaliber bone screw product line are our cylindrical screws, which are geared towards the trauma applications of the Galaxy Fixation System. We believe we have a full line of bone screws to meet the demands of the market. 
 In 2017, we introduced JuniOrtho, a new brand identity for extremity fixation pediatric products. JuniOrtho is a range of products and resources dedicated to pediatrics and young adults with bone fractures and deformities that brings together our expertise and products in the pediatric space.
 Internal Fixation
 Internal fixation devices come in various sizes, depending on the bone that requires treatment, and consist of either long rods, commonly referred to as nails, or plates that are attached with the use of screws. A nail is inserted into the medullary canal of a fractured long bone of the human arm or leg (e.g., humerus, femur or tibia). Alternatively, a plate is attached by screws to an area such as a broken wrist, hip or foot. Examples of our internal fixation devices include: 

• | The Chimaera Hip Nailing System, which is indicated for the treatment of hip fractures. The Chimaera hip nail is designed to offer improvements over currently available nails by taking advantage of decades of knowledge in hip nailing. The result is a strong, versatile nail that allows fixation to be adapted to the type of fracture being treated. An all-in-one dedicated instrument tray contains a color-coded instrument set designed for increased precision during the surgical steps as well as intuitive instrument selection. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The VeroNail Trochanteric Nailing System, which is indicated for the treatment of hip fractures. The nail design is minimally-invasive to reduce surgical trauma and allow patients to begin walking again shortly after the operation. It uses a dual screw configuration that we believe provides more stability than previous single screw designs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Centronail Titanium Nailing System, which comprises a range of titanium nails to stabilize fractures in the femur, tibia and humerus. The system offers improved mechanical distal targeting and minimal instrumentation to optimize inventory.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Ankle Hindfoot Nail, which is an arthrodesis nailing system designed to improve upon the stability, simplicity, and flexibility of current hindfoot nails.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Agile Nail, which is designed to treat femoral fractures in patients where a small rigid nail is needed. Its unique design requires less inventory and is the smallest titanium nail currently available in the market. This provides further benefits such as reduced invasiveness and lightness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13


 
• | The MJ Flex, which is an elastic nail system that innovates a technique considered to be the gold standard in the treatment of pediatric fractures. The unique shape of the nail offers improved strength, better visibility, more rigidity, and potentially a reduced usage of x-rays. The system is available in different sizes, both in titanium and stainless steel.

 In addition to treating bone fractures, we also design, manufacture and distribute devices intended to treat congenital bone conditions, such as angular deformities (e.g., bowed legs in children), or degenerative diseases, as well as conditions resulting from a previous trauma. An example of a product offered in this area is the Eight-Plate Guided Growth System. 
 Product Development
 Our primary research and development facilities are located in Verona, Italy and Lewisville, Texas. We work with leading hospital research institutions, as well as with MTF, physicians and other consultants, on the long-term scientific planning and evolution of our products and therapies. Several of the products that we market have been developed through these collaborations. In addition, we periodically receive suggestions for new products and product enhancements from the scientific and medical community, some of which result in us entering into assignment or license agreements with physicians and third parties.
 In 2018, 2017 and 2016 we incurred $33.2 million, $29.7 million and $28.8 million, respectively, of research and development expense.
 Patents, Trade Secrets, Assignments and Licenses 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, assignment and license agreements, and non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, have numerous pending patent applications and have license rights under patents held by third parties. Our primary products are patented in the major markets in which they are sold. No assurance can be given that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or assigned to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that such patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage or protection. Third parties might also obtain patents that would require assignments to or licensing by us to conduct our business. We rely on confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with key employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. 
 We obtain assignments or licenses of varying durations for certain of our products from third parties. We typically acquire rights under such assignments or licenses in exchange for lump-sum payments or arrangements under which we pay a percentage of sales to the licensor. However, while assignments or licenses to us generally are irrevocable, no assurance can be given that these arrangements will continue to be made available to us on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. The terms of our license and assignment agreements vary in length from a specified number of years to the life of product patents or the economic life of the product. These agreements generally provide for royalty payments and termination rights in the event of a material breach. 
 Compliance and Ethics Program
 It is a fundamental policy of our Company to conduct business in accordance with the highest ethical and legal standards. We have a comprehensive compliance and ethics program, which is overseen by our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. The program is intended to promote legal compliance and ethical business practices throughout our domestic and international businesses. It is designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable federal, state and local laws in accordance with the standards set forth in guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (“Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs” (February 2017)), the Office of Inspector General (HCCA-OIG “Measuring Compliance Program Effectiveness: A Resource Guide” (March 2017)) and the U.S. Sentencing Commission (“Effective Compliance and Ethics Programs (November 2014)). Key elements of the program include:  

• | Organizational oversight by senior-level personnel responsible for the compliance function within our Company;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Written standards and procedures, including a Corporate Code of Conduct;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Methods for communicating compliance concerns, including anonymous reporting mechanisms;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Investigation and remediation measures to ensure prompt response to reported matters and timely corrective action;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation 
 Classification and Approval of Products by the FDA and other Regulatory Authorities
 Our research, development and clinical programs, and our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and other countries. Most notably, all of our products sold in the U.S. are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Services Act as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The regulations that cover our products and facilities vary widely from country to country. The amount of time required to obtain approvals or clearances from regulatory authorities also differs from country to country. 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we commercially distribute in the U.S. is covered by premarket notification (“510(k)”) clearance, letter to file, approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”), or some other approval from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, which generally determine the type of FDA approval required. Devices deemed to pose low risk are placed in class I, while devices that are considered to pose moderate risk are placed in class II, and devices deemed to pose the greatest risks requiring more regulatory controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a device that previously received 510(k) clearance (as described below), are placed in class III. Our Spinal Implants and Orthofix Extremities products are, for the most part, class II devices and the instruments used in conjunction with these products are generally class I. Our Bone Growth Therapies products and the M6-C artificial cervical disc are classified as class III by the FDA, and have been approved for commercial distribution in the U.S. through the PMA process. 
 The medical devices we develop, manufacture, distribute and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining FDA clearance and other regulatory approvals to develop and market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. While we believe we have obtained all necessary clearances and approvals for the manufacture and sale of our products and that they are in material compliance with applicable FDA and other material regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue such compliance. 
 
To market our devices within the member states of the European Union, we are required to comply with the European Medical Device Directives. Under the European Medical Device Directives, all medical devices must bear the CE mark. To obtain authorization to affix the CE mark to our products, a recognized European Notified Body must assess our quality systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the European Medical Device Directives. We are subject to an annual inspection by a Notified Body for compliance with these requirements.
 Our Biologics reporting segment markets tissue for bone repair and reconstruction under the brand names Trinity Evolution and Trinity ELITE, our allogeneic bone matrices comprised of cancellous bone containing viable stem cells and a demineralized cortical bone component. These allografts are regulated under the FDA’s Human Cell, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, or HCT/P, regulatory paradigm and not as a medical device, biologic or a drug. The Biologics reporting segment also distributes certain surgical implant products known as “allograft” products that are derived from human tissues and which are used for bone reconstruction or repair and are surgically implanted into the human body. These tissues are regulated by the FDA as minimally-manipulated tissue and covered by FDA’s “Good Tissues Practices” regulations, which cover all stages of allograft processing. There can be no assurance our suppliers of the Trinity Evolution, Trinity ELITE and allograft products will continue to meet applicable regulatory requirements or that those requirements will not be changed in ways that could adversely affect our business. Further, there can be no assurance these products will continue to be made available to us or that applicable regulatory standards will be met or remain unchanged. Moreover, products derived from human tissue or bones are from time to time subject to recall for certain administrative or safety reasons and we may be affected by one or more such recalls. For a further description of some of these risks, see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.” 
 15


Certain Other Product and Manufacturing Regulations
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. Those regulatory requirements include: product listing and establishment registration; Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; labeling regulations and governmental prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses or indications; clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our PMA approved devices; Medical Device Adverse Event Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA and other foreign governmental agencies if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and notices of corrections or removals. 
 We and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and European Notified Bodies to determine our compliance with the FDA’s QSR and other international regulations. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our employees or our suppliers; unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products; withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure; interruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. In addition to FDA inspections, all manufacturing facilities of the Company are subject to annual Notified Body inspections. 
 Moreover, governmental authorities outside the U.S. have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices. Our products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. U.S. or non-U.S. government regulations may be imposed in the future that may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. For a description of some of these risks, see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.”
 Accreditation Requirements
 In addition, our subsidiary Orthofix Inc. has been accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care, Inc. (“ACHC”) for medical supply provider services with respect to durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (“DMEPOS”). ACHC, a private, not-for-profit corporation, which is certified to ISO 9001:2000 standards, was developed by home care and community-based providers to help companies improve business operations and quality of patient care. Although accreditation is generally a voluntary activity where healthcare organizations submit to peer review their internal policies, processes and patient care delivery against national standards, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) required DMEPOS suppliers to become accredited. We believe that by attaining accreditation, Orthofix Inc. has demonstrated its commitment to maintain a higher level of competency and strive for excellence in its products, services, and customer satisfaction.
Third-Party Payor Requirements
 Our products may be reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare or private insurance plans and healthcare networks. Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device provided to a patient or used in a procedure does not meet applicable payment criteria or if the policyholder’s healthcare insurance benefits are limited. Also, non-government third-party payors are increasingly challenging the medical necessity and prices paid for our products and services. The Medicare program is expected to continue to implement a new payment mechanism for certain DMEPOS items via the implementation of its competitive bidding program. Bone growth therapy devices are currently exempt from this competitive bidding process. 
 16


Laws Regulating Healthcare Fraud and Abuse; State Healthcare Laws
 Our sales and marketing practices are also subject to a number of U.S. laws regulating healthcare fraud and abuse such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal Physician Self-Referral Law (known as the “Stark Law”), the Civil False Claims Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) as well as numerous state laws regulating healthcare and insurance. These laws are enforced by the Office of Inspector General within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and other federal, state and local agencies. Among other things, these laws and others generally: (1) prohibit the provision of anything of value in exchange for the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, (including Medicare and Medicaid); (2) require that claims for payment submitted to federal healthcare programs be truthful; (3) prohibit the transmission of protected healthcare information to persons not authorized to receive that information; and (4) require the maintenance of certain government licenses and permits. 
Laws Protecting the Confidentiality of Health Information
 U.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain health information, in particular individually identifiable information such as medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of that protected information. At the federal level, the Department of Health and Human Services promulgates health information privacy and security rules under HIPAA. These rules protect health information by regulating its use and disclosure, including for research and other purposes. Failure of a HIPAA “covered entity” to comply with HIPAA regarding such “protected health information” could constitute a violation of federal law, subject to civil and criminal penalties. Covered entities include healthcare providers (including certain of those that sell devices or equipment) that engage in particular electronic transactions, including, as we do, the transmission of claims to health plans. Consequently, health information that we access, collect, analyze, and otherwise use and/or disclose includes protected health information that is subject to HIPAA. As noted above, many state laws also pertain to the confidentiality of health information. Such laws are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, in particular those state laws that afford greater privacy protection to the individual than HIPAA. These state laws typically have their own penalty provisions, which could be applied in the event of an unlawful action affecting health information. 
 In Europe, the new General Data Protection Regulation may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of violations. Internationally, some countries have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data.
 Physician Payments Sunshine Provision of the Affordable Care Act
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Provision of the Affordable Care Act (Section 6002) (the “Sunshine Act”), which was enacted in 2010 and became subject to final CMS rules in 2013, requires public disclosure to the United States government of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals, including in-kind transfers of value such as gifts or meals. The Act also provides penalties for non-compliance. The Act requires that we file an annual report on March 31st of a calendar year for the transfers of value incurred for the prior calendar year.
 In October 2018, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (the “SUPPORT Act”) was signed into law. The SUPPORT Act expands the reporting obligation under the Sunshine Act to include payments and other transfers of value made to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives. These expanded reporting obligations are effective for payments reported in 2022, with payment tracking beginning in 2021. Non-compliance with the Sunshine Act or SUPPORT Act is subject to civil monetary penalties.
 In addition to the Sunshine Act, as expanded by the SUPPORT Act, we seek to comply with other international and individual state transparency laws, like Massachusetts and Vermont.
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 General Trends 
 We believe that demographic trends, principally in the form of a better informed, more active and aging population in the major healthcare markets of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan, together with opportunities in emerging markets such as the Asia-Pacific Region and Latin America, as well as our focus on innovative products, will continue to have a positive effect on the demand for our products. 
 17


Reporting Segments 
 Our revenues are generated from the sales of products in our four reporting segments: Bone Growth Therapies, Spinal Implants, Biologics, and Orthofix Extremities. See the chart below for the distribution of sales between each of our reporting segments for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. 
Sales Network 
 We have a broad sales network comprised of direct sales representatives and distributors. This established sales network provides us with a platform to introduce new products and expand sales of existing products. We distribute our products worldwide in over 70 countries. 
 In our largest market, the U.S., our sales network is generally comprised of four sales forces, each addressing one of our reporting segments, however some independent distributors sell products for more than one of our segments. A hybrid distribution network of direct sales representatives and independent distributors sells products in our Bone Growth Therapies reporting segment, while primarily independent distributors sell products in our Spinal Implants, Biologics, and Orthofix Extremities reporting segments. 
 Outside the U.S., we employ direct sales representatives and contract with independent distributors. In order to provide support to our independent sales network, we have sales and marketing specialists who regularly visit independent distributors to provide training and product support. 
 Marketing and Product Education 
 We market and sell our products principally to physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, integrated health delivery systems and other purchasing organizations. 
 We support our sales force through specialized training workshops in which physicians and sales specialists participate. We also produce marketing and training materials, including materials outlining surgical procedures, for our customers, sales force and distributors in a variety of languages using printed, video and multimedia formats. We require all of our sales force, direct and independent, to undergo extensive product, policy, and compliance training to ensure adherence to our standards, policies, and applicable law.
 To provide additional advanced training for physicians, consistent with the AdvaMed Code of Ethics (“AdvaMed Code”) and the MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice (“MedTech Code”), we organize regular multilingual teaching seminars in multiple locations. Those places include our facility in Verona, Italy, various locations in Latin America and in Lewisville, Texas. In recent years, thousands of surgeons from around the world attended these product education seminars, which have included a variety of lectures from specialists, as well as demonstrations and hands-on workshops.

Competition
 Our Bone Growth Therapies reporting unit competes principally with similar products marketed by Zimmer Biomet, Inc.; DJO Global; and Bioventus. The Biologics HCT/P and Spinal Implants products we market compete with products marketed by Medtronic, Inc.; DePuy Synthes, a division of Johnson and Johnson; Stryker Corp.; Zimmer Biomet, Inc.; NuVasive, Inc.; Globus Medical Inc.; and various smaller public and private companies. For Orthofix Extremities devices, our principal competitors include DePuy Synthes; Zimmer Biomet, Inc.; Stryker Corp.; Smith & Nephew plc; and Wright Medical Group N.V. 
 We believe that we enhance our competitive position by focusing on product features such as ease of use, versatility, cost and patient acceptability, together with value-added services, such as the STIM on Track mobile app and our JuniOrtho educational products and services. We attempt to avoid competing based solely on price. Overall cost and medical effectiveness, innovation, reliability, value-added service, and training are the most prevalent methods of competition in the markets for our products, and we believe we compete effectively.  
 Manufacturing and Sources of Supply 
 We generally design, develop, assemble, test and package our stimulation, orthopedic, and spinal implant products, and subcontract the manufacture of a substantial portion of the component parts and instruments. We design and develop our AlloQuent Allograft HCT/Ps and subcontract its manufacturing. Through subcontracting a portion of our manufacturing, we attempt to maintain operating flexibility in meeting demand while focusing our resources on product development, education and marketing as well as quality assurance standards. Although certain of our key raw materials are obtained from a single source, we believe alternate sources for these materials are available. Further, we believe an adequate inventory supply is maintained to avoid product flow interruptions. Historically, we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining the materials necessary to meet our production schedules. 
 The Trinity Evolution and Trinity ELITE HCT/Ps, for which we have exclusive marketing rights, are allograft tissue forms that are supplied to customers by MTF in accordance with orders received directly from us. MTF sources, processes and packages the tissue forms and is the sole supplier of the Trinity Evolution and Trinity ELITE HCT/Ps to our customers. 
 Our products are currently manufactured and assembled in the U.S. and Italy. We believe our plants comply in all material respects with the requirements of the FDA and all relevant regulatory authorities outside the U.S. For a description of the laws to which we are subject, see Item 1, “Business”, under the subheadings “Corporate Compliance and Ethics Program” and “Government Regulation.” We actively monitor each of our subcontractors in order to maintain manufacturing and quality standards and product specification conformity. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2018, we had 954 employees worldwide. Of these, 686 were employed in the U.S. and 268 were employed at other non-U.S. locations. Our relations with our Italian employees, who numbered 187 at December 31, 2018, are governed by the provisions of a National Collective Labor Agreement setting forth mandatory minimum standards for labor relations in the metal mechanic workers industry. We are not a party to any other collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
