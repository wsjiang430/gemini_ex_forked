Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to acquiring, developing and commercializing life-changing medicines for underserved patient populations suffering from devastating rare diseases and cancer. We have a differentiated portfolio of small molecule targeted oncology product candidates and are advancing two late-stage clinical trials, one registrational and one potentially registrational, in rare tumor types, as well as several other programs addressing highly prevalent, genetically defined cancers. Our strategic approach and operational excellence across research, translational science, and clinical development have enabled us to rapidly advance our two lead product candidates into late-stage clinical trials, enabling a New Drug Application, or NDA, for one such candidate which was accepted in February 2023, while simultaneously entering into multiple shared-value partnerships with industry leaders to expand our portfolio. From this foundation, we are continuing to build a differentiated, fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company intensely focused on understanding patients and their diseases in order to develop and deliver transformative targeted medicines.
Our most advanced product candidate, nirogacestat, is an investigational oral, small molecule gamma secretase inhibitor, or GSI, in development as a monotherapy for the treatment of desmoid tumors, a rare and often debilitating and disfiguring soft tissue tumor for which there are currently no therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In December 2022, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for nirogacestat for the treatment of adults with desmoid tumors. On February 27, 2023, we announced that the FDA accepted the NDA filing and granted priority review. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date of August 27, 2023. In addition, the FDA has stated that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. The NDA submission is being reviewed under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review, or RTOR, program and is supported by positive data from the Phase 3 DeFi trial, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with desmoid tumors. In May 2022, we announced positive topline results from the DeFi trial, and we presented additional data from the DeFi trial at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress, or ESMO, in September 2022. The DeFi trial met its primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival, or PFS, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement for nirogacestat over placebo, with a 71% reduction in the risk of disease progression (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.29 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.55); p < 0.001). Nirogacestat also demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in objective response rate and in patient-reported outcomes, or PROs, all of which were prespecified secondary endpoints of the study. In addition, nirogacestat exhibited a manageable safety profile in the DeFi trial, with 95% of all treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, reported as Grade 1 or 2. The most frequently reported TEAEs in participants receiving nirogacestat were diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue. In addition, events of ovarian dysfunction, which was defined by investigator-reported events of amenorrhea, premature menopause, menopause, and ovarian failure, and which was observed in 75% of women of childbearing potential receiving nirogacestat, resolved in 74% of the affected participants. The FDA has granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations to nirogacestat for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis. Nirogacestat has also received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of desmoid tumors and from the European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.
We are actively engaged in commercial preparations to support the potential U.S. launch of nirogacestat, if approved, for the treatment of adults with desmoid tumors. We also expect to file a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency in the European Union in 2024. 
We are also evaluating nirogacestat for the treatment of ovarian granulosa cell tumors, or GCT, a subtype of ovarian cancer. In September 2022, we announced that the first patient had been dosed in an ongoing Phase 2 trial evaluating nirogacestat as a monotherapy in patients with recurrent ovarian GCT.
Our second product candidate is mirdametinib, an investigational oral, small molecule MEK inhibitor currently in development for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas, or NF1-PN, a rare tumor of the peripheral nerve sheath that causes significant pain and disfigurement. We believe that mirdametinib has the potential to offer a best-in-class profile in order to enable the long-term treatment required for this patient population, as compared to other MEK inhibitors. The FDA has granted mirdametinib both Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation for NF1-PN, and the European Commission has granted mirdametinib Orphan Drug Designation for NF1. In November 2021, we announced full enrollment of the ReNeu trial, a potentially registrational Phase 2b clinical trial of mirdametinib for pediatric and adult patients with NF1-PN, and we expect to report topline data for the ReNeu trial in the second half of 2023.
In hematologic malignancies, we are evaluating novel combination regimens of nirogacestat alongside B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, directed therapies for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We have entered into several clinical collaboration agreements with industry partners to evaluate nirogacestat in combination with several different BCMA-directed therapies. In addition to our industry collaborations, we are working with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and 
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to further explore nirogacestat’s ability to potentiate BCMA-directed therapies as part of sponsored research agreements. 
In genetically defined metastatic solid tumors, our current clinical-stage efforts center on the mitogen activated protein kinase, or MAPK, pathway. We are evaluating mirdametinib for the treatment of solid tumors harboring MAPK aberrations in both monotherapy and combination approaches. In collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd., or BeiGene, we are exploring the combination of mirdametinib with BeiGene’s lifirafenib in RAS mutated and other MAPK aberrant cancers. In addition, we are exploring the use of BGB-3245 in a distinct set of genetically defined BRAF mutated tumors via MapKure, LLC, or MapKure, an entity jointly owned by us and BeiGene. In June 2022, we presented initial clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial evaluating mirdametinib in combination with lifirafenib in patients with advanced solid tumors with MAPK-activating mutations and the ongoing Phase 1 trial evaluating BGB-3245 in patients with advanced solid tumors with BRAF or RAS mutations, providing evidence of a manageable safety profile and clinical activity in a variety of solid tumor types with MAPK-activating mutations for each program. We expect to present additional data for mirdametinib in combination with lifirafenib from the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial and additional BGB-3245 monotherapy data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial at a medical conference in the first half of 2023. In February 2023, the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1/2a open-label, dose escalation and expansion trial evaluating mirdametinib in combination with BGB-3245 in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring MAPK mutations. In academic-sponsored studies supported by SpringWorks, mirdametinib is being evaluated for the treatment of low-grade gliomas in children and young adults and other advanced solid tumors harboring various MAPK-activating mutations. 
Furthermore, we intend to continue to build our portfolio with assets that have strong biological rationales and validated mechanisms of action, such as the TEA Domain, or TEAD, inhibitor program that we in-licensed from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, or KU Leuven and the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology, and the portfolio of epidermal growth factor receptor small molecule inhibitors that we in-licensed from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we nominated a TEAD inhibitor development candidate, SW-682, and we plan to file an Investigational New Drug Application for SW-682 in 2023. We continue to invest in our R&D infrastructure to support both our drug discovery capabilities and our translational medicine activities for development programs. 
We plan to continue using shared-value partnerships to maximize the potential of our therapies to serve patients. We have invested in building leading preclinical, clinical, medical and commercial capabilities and have focused on structuring innovative partnerships that seek to align incentives and optimize business outcomes for each party involved. We believe that this approach will continue to allow us to expand our collaborative relationships with innovators, maximize the potential of our existing and future portfolio, and support the building of a scalable and sustainable business focused on the efficient advancement and commercialization of product candidates that hold the potential to transform the lives of oncology patients.
Our strategy
Our goal is to continue building a differentiated, global biopharmaceutical company by acquiring, developing and commercializing transformative medicines for underserved patient populations. We aim to be an industry leader in rare diseases and targeted oncology.
The key elements of our strategy include:
•Efficiently advance our lead product candidates, nirogacestat and mirdametinib, towards marketing approval in the rare oncology indications in which they are currently being developed. We believe that our leading drug development capabilities will enable us to continue efficiently advancing our product candidates towards marketing approval, and we will make use of accelerated regulatory pathways when possible. Since our inception in August 2017, we have made rapid progress advancing two product candidates towards marketing approval. Our first product candidate, nirogacestat, was granted Orphan Drug Designation, Fast Track Designation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the treatment of desmoid tumors and Orphan Drug Designation by the European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. In May 2022, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 DeFi trial, and we presented additional data from the DeFi trial at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in September 2022. In December 2022, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for nirogacestat for the treatment of adults with desmoid tumors. In February 2023, the NDA filing was accepted by the FDA and granted priority review with an assigned PDUFA target action date of August 27, 2023. Our second product candidate, mirdametinib, was granted Orphan Drug Designation by both the FDA and the European Commission for the treatment of NF1 and Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the treatment of NF1-PN. Mirdametinib is currently being evaluated in the potentially registrational ReNeu trial; in June 2021, interim clinical data from the first 20 adult patients enrolled in the Phase 2b ReNeu trial were presented at the Children's Tumor Foundation NF Conference. In November 2021, we announced full enrollment of the ReNeu trial, and we expect to report topline results in the second half of 2023.
•Establish nirogacestat as a cornerstone of BCMA-targeted therapy in multiple myeloma and deploy our precision oncology approach towards the treatment of biomarker defined subgroups of highly prevalent metastatic solid tumors. We have entered into several clinical collaboration agreements to evaluate nirogacestat in combination with BCMA-targeted therapies of various modalities, including antibody-drug conjugates, CAR T-cell therapies, bispecific antibodies and monoclonal antibodies, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. We believe that nirogacestat in combination with BCMA-targeted therapies has the potential to improve clinical outcomes of multiple myeloma patients compared to a BCMA-targeted therapy alone. We continue to use a precision medicine approach to identify and develop potential treatments for patients with genetically-defined cancers. Our clinical-stage efforts are focused on developing monotherapy and combination approaches targeting solid tumors harboring MAPK aberrations. 
•Maximize the potential of our portfolio through strategic partnerships and deploy our value-driven approach to identifying, acquiring and developing new medicines to further expand our portfolio. We have entered into strategic partnerships to develop innovative combination therapies that leverage emerging insights into the fundamental mechanisms that drive cancer. Our strategy is to align incentives among parties by sharing development costs and downstream economics for selected partnered programs. By pursuing this strategy, we believe that we can access promising therapies being developed across the biopharmaceutical industry for which there is scientific and clinical rationale for combinations with our existing product candidates. We have announced collaborations with several industry and academic partners, and we intend to execute additional strategic partnerships in the future.
•Commercialize our product candidates, if approved, either alone or in partnership with others, to bring new medicines to underserved patient populations using a focused and efficient approach. We intend to market and commercialize our product candidates, if approved, in the U.S. and select international markets, either alone or in partnership with others. We are in the process of completing our commercial readiness activities in anticipation of our first commercial launch in the U.S., including the continued buildout of our medical affairs organization and commercial infrastructure. We continue to employ a focused and efficient approach with these efforts, initially establishing market access, sales and marketing capabilities in a targeted manner that is appropriate for the relevant product opportunity. We believe that this approach will allow us to effectively reach the patients and physicians that our product candidates have been developed for and to maximize the commercial potential of our portfolio.
•Continue to cultivate a tightly integrated network of patient advocacy groups, key opinion leaders, research institutions and healthcare providers to inform our approach to developing therapies that can transform the lives of patients and their families. We believe that in order to develop our portfolio in an efficient and impactful manner, it is imperative to cultivate a network of key stakeholders. Integrating the experiences and insights from these stakeholders, which include the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation, the Children’s Tumor Foundation and leading academic physicians and researchers, continues to inform our approach to developing therapies that can transform the lives of patients and their families suffering from devastating rare diseases and cancer.
•Attract, retain and support the best talent through our deep commitment to maintaining a culture of diversity, inclusion and professional excellence. We are committed to building our organization with a culture supported by our patient-focused mission and organizational strength that is driven by diversity in experience and perspectives.

For purposes of this report, when we refer herein to a “potentially registrational trial,” we are referring to a clinical trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of a product candidate to potentially support submission of a marketing application for such product candidate with the applicable regulatory authorities. Such a trial is also sometimes referred to as a Phase 2/3 or Phase 3 clinical trial or a pivotal trial.
Nirogacestat
Overview
Nirogacestat, our most advanced product candidate, is an investigational oral, selective GSI that we are developing for the treatment of several oncology indications, including desmoid tumors, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and multiple myeloma, where significant unmet medical need exists despite currently available therapies. Gamma secretase is a protease complex that cleaves numerous transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein, or APP, Notch, HER4, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, BCMA and CD44. Cleavage of these transmembrane proteins by gamma secretase leads to a variety of signaling events that result from the untethering of the cytoplasmic domains of these proteins. Several of gamma secretase’s substrates have been implicated in a variety of diseases, including APP in Alzheimer’s disease and BCMA and Notch in cancer, forming the rationale for evaluating gamma secretase as a therapeutic target. 
In June 2018, the FDA granted nirogacestat Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of desmoid tumors, and in November 2018, the FDA granted nirogacestat Fast Track Designation for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis. In August 2019, the FDA granted nirogacestat Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis. In addition, in September 2019, the European Commission granted nirogacestat Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.
Based on encouraging results in desmoid tumor patients from Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, in May 2019, we announced the initiation of the DeFi trial, a registrational Phase 3, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, and in July 2020, we announced full enrollment of the trial. In May 2022, we announced positive topline results from the DeFi trial and presented additional data from the DeFi trial at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in September 2022, in which nirogacestat demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements compared to placebo in all primary and secondary efficacy and quality of life endpoints. 
In December 2022, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for nirogacestat for the treatment of adults with desmoid tumors. On February 27, 2023, we announced that the FDA accepted the NDA filing and granted priority review. The FDA has assigned a PDUFA target action date of August 27, 2023. In addition, the FDA has stated that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. 
We are also evaluating nirogacestat for the treatment of ovarian granulosa cell tumors, a subtype of ovarian cancer. In September 2022, we announced that the first patient had been dosed in a Phase 2 trial evaluating nirogacestat as a monotherapy in patients with recurrent ovarian granulosa cell tumors.
In addition to our monotherapy development efforts, we are evaluating nirogacestat as a combination agent with BCMA-targeted therapies for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. GSIs have been shown to reduce cleavage of membrane-bound BCMA on multiple myeloma cells, thereby improving the activity of BCMA-targeted therapies. We are evaluating this novel combination therapy approach across BCMA-targeted modalities through clinical collaborations with several industry partners.
Nirogacestat for treatment of desmoid tumors
Disease background
Desmoid tumors, also referred to as aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid-type fibromatosis, are rare, non-metastatic soft tissue tumors that can occur in both children and adults. These tumors are characterized by a growth pattern that can invade surrounding healthy tissues, including joints, muscle and viscera. Depending on tumor size, aggressiveness of growth pattern and location, desmoid tumors can cause severe morbidities such as pain, disfigurement, internal bleeding and debilitating impairment on range of motion. An epidemiology study of 179 desmoid tumors patients treated at two Danish sarcoma centers, Aarhus University Hospital and Copenhagen University Hospital, indicated that healthcare resource utilization by patients is significantly elevated for about 3 years following a desmoid tumor diagnosis in part due to increased inpatient and outpatient visits and days in the hospital, underscoring the significance of the morbidities that result from this disease.
Desmoid tumors typically occur in patients between the ages of 15 and 60 years old and are more commonly diagnosed in the third and fourth decades of life, with a two-to-three times higher prevalence in females. The annual incidence is estimated to be 1,000 to 1,650 new desmoid tumor patients diagnosed each year in the U.S. Most cases of desmoid tumor occur spontaneously and are associated with one of several mutations in the CTNNB1 gene, which encodes for the β-catenin protein. Patients with a family history of familial adenomatous polyposis, or FAP, have an approximately 850-fold higher risk of developing desmoid tumors compared to the general population. FAP patients with desmoid tumors typically have tumors that are attributable to germline mutations in the APC gene, which encodes for a protein involved in the degradation of β-catenin. When APC or CTNNB1 mutations are present, tissue trauma, including surgery, pregnancy or soft tissue injury, can lead to the formation of desmoid tumors.
The clinical course of desmoid tumors varies across the patient population. Within any given patient, desmoid tumors can alternate between periods of rapid growth and stabilization, and spontaneous regressions have been observed in approximately 5-10% of patients over a multi-year follow-up period. Desmoid tumors can vary significantly in terms of their morphology and radiographic appearance but are generally routine to diagnose. Desmoid tumors are usually first noted upon physical examination or by using various imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, computed tomography, or CT, or magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. Histologically, desmoid tumors appear with variable collagen deposition and are not clearly circumscribed. Definitive diagnosis relies upon immunohistochemical stains for nuclear localization of β-catenin. Diagnosis can also be confirmed by screening for mutations in the CTNNB1 and APC genes.
Desmoid tumors, despite being highly morbid, typically have a limited impact on mortality. Due to this limited impact on overall lifespan and current poor treatment options, we believe that there is a sizable prevalent pool of desmoid tumor patients. Existing treatments for desmoid tumors often have low success rates. Up to 77% of patients undergoing surgery will relapse depending on patient age, tumor location and tumor size. Furthermore, based on market research studies with feedback from over 400 physicians who manage patients with desmoid tumors, we believe that approximately 50% of patients receiving a given systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or a locoregional intervention such as surgery will not have a satisfactory treatment outcome and will require subsequent treatment for their desmoid tumors. Based on multiple market research studies, we believe that up to 90% or more of patients will eventually receive an active intervention, and we estimate that, in any given year over the next decade, approximately 5,500 to 7,000 desmoid tumor patients will be actively receiving treatment in the U.S.
Current treatment landscape for desmoid tumors
There are currently no therapies approved by the FDA for the treatment of desmoid tumors. Historically, desmoid tumors were treated with surgical resection, but this approach has become less favored due to an emerging body of evidence showing a post-
surgical tumor recurrence rate of up to 77%, which can potentially increase disease burden and require additional intervention. In addition to the high recurrence rates, surgery itself carries risk of complications and can also be highly morbid, occasionally requiring limb amputation. Given the potential morbidities of surgery and the uncertain magnitude and durability of its benefit, physicians now typically adopt an active surveillance approach for patients who historically may have been candidates for surgery. Despite its limitations, surgery is still used when a desmoid tumor presents significant risk of morbidity or mortality, such as tumors arising in the head and neck. Radiation therapy may also be used alone or in conjunction with surgery but is generally not preferred given the reported risk of developing secondary neoplasms.
In addition to these local treatments, systemic therapies have been used off-label with varying degrees of activity and tolerability. These therapies include chemotherapeutic agents, such as liposomal doxorubicin and vinblastine/methotrexate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-hormonal therapies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib, imatinib and pazopanib. Of these agents, only sorafenib has been studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with desmoid tumors; this Phase 3 clinical trial was investigator-initiated and did not have a biopharmaceutical industry sponsor. Although sorafenib demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to placebo, tolerability was a substantial issue; 20% of treated patients discontinued due to adverse events and an additional 22% of treated patients withdrew consent. At a median follow-up time of 27 months, 61% of the patients receiving sorafenib had discontinued treatment. Overall, we believe that the available off-label systemic therapies are poorly suited for the treatment of desmoid tumors and have not demonstrated an acceptable balance of safety and activity in this population. Therefore, we believe a significant unmet medical need exists for the treatment of desmoid tumors.
Mechanism of action
Nirogacestat is an investigational oral, potent, selective, reversible, noncompetitive small molecule inhibitor of gamma secretase, an integral protease complex that cleaves numerous functionally important transmembrane proteins, including Notch. Gamma secretase’s cleavage of Notch causes the release of the Notch intracellular domain, or NICD, which shuttles into the nucleus and activates transcription of downstream target genes. Notch signaling is a regulator of cell proliferation and its dysregulation has been implicated in many forms of cancer. In desmoid tumor cell lines, nirogacestat has been observed to significantly decrease NICD release and reduce downstream activity of the Notch signaling pathway and decrease tumor cell migration, invasion and growth.
Clinical development of nirogacestat in desmoid tumors
Prior to the initiation of the Phase 3 DeFi trial, nirogacestat’s clinical activity was observed in two clinical trials that enrolled adult desmoid tumor patients. The first of these was a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial conducted by Pfizer in patients with solid tumors, a subset of whom had a diagnosis of desmoid tumor. Of the seven evaluable desmoid tumor patients, five patients achieved a partial response, or PR, by RECIST v1.0, resulting in an objective response rate, or ORR, of 71% with a disease control rate of 100%. Given the activity of nirogacestat in the desmoid tumor patients treated in this Phase 1 clinical trial, the NCI conducted a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with progressing desmoid tumors, which evaluated nirogacestat at 150 mg twice daily, or BID, the same dose used in our DeFi trial. In the NCI-sponsored Phase 2 trial, of the 17 desmoid tumor patients enrolled in the study, five patients achieved a confirmed PR by RECIST v1.1, resulting in an ORR of 29% with no progressive disease. Nirogacestat was well tolerated across both clinical trials, with a median time on treatment of over 4 years reported at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. The promising clinical activity and safety profile for nirogacestat demonstrated in these Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in desmoid tumor patients supported the initiation of the Phase 3 DeFi trial. 
In August 2020, investigators at the University of Minnesota and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute published data where clinical benefit was observed in four pediatric and young adult desmoid tumor patients treated with nirogacestat under our Expanded Access Program. The clinical activity of nirogacestat in these four patients yielded one complete response, two partial responses and one stable disease, with no Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse events reported. We are encouraged by the data in these four pediatric and young adult patients and believe that this Phase 2 clinical trial supports further evaluation of the potential benefit of nirogacestat in younger desmoid tumor patients. In September 2020, a Phase 2 clinical trial was initiated in collaboration with the Children's Oncology Group, or COG, to evaluate nirogacestat for the treatment of children and adolescents with progressive, surgically unresectable desmoid tumors. In the fourth quarter of 2022, this trial met its accrual goal.
Phase 3 DeFi trial in desmoid tumors
Based upon the degree of clinical benefit for desmoid tumor patients observed in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, as well as our discussions with the FDA, we initiated the DeFi trial in May 2019 and announced full enrollment in July 2020. 
The DeFi trial is a registrational Phase 3, global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, conducted at 37 clinical sites in North America and Europe.
The DeFi trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of nirogacestat compared to placebo in patients with progressing desmoid tumors. We enrolled 142 patients who had histologically confirmed desmoid tumors with progressive disease (defined as tumor growth within the past 12 months as measured by RECIST v1.1) and were either treatment-naïve with desmoid tumors not amenable to surgery or had refractory or recurrent disease (after ≥1 line of therapy).
The trial consists of two phases: a double-blind phase and an optional open-label extension, or OLE, phase. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 150 mg BID of nirogacestat or placebo every day for 28-day cycles. Patients were treated with nirogacestat or placebo until they developed clinical or radiographic disease progression, experienced unacceptable toxicity or withdrew consent. Eligible patients with confirmed disease progression on trial could enter the optional OLE phase to receive 150 mg BID of nirogacestat.
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, or PFS, defined as the time from randomization until the date of assessment of progression or death by any cause. Progression was determined radiographically using RECIST v1.1 or clinically by blinded, independent, central radiologic or clinical review. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included safety and tolerability measures, objective response rate, or ORR, duration of response, changes in tumor volume assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and patient-reported outcomes, including measures of pain, symptom burden, physical/role function and overall quality of life.
In May 2022, we announced positive topline results from the DeFi trial, and we presented additional data from the DeFi trial at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in September 2022. 
The DeFi trial met its primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival, or PFS, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement for nirogacestat over placebo, with a 71% reduction in the risk of disease progression (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.29 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.55); p < 0.001). The median Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS was not reached in the nirogacestat arm and was 15.1 months in the placebo arm. A PFS benefit was observed across all prespecified subgroups, including gender, tumor location, prior treatment or surgery, and mutational status. The following graph shows the estimated PFS probability at each time point for the nirogacestat and placebo arms:
Prespecified secondary efficacy endpoints were confirmed objective response (defined as the proportion of participants with complete response or partial response per RECIST v1.1) and change from baseline at Cycle 10 in the following patient-reported outcomes, or PROs: Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) Average Worst Pain Intensity; GOunder/Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation DEsmoid Symptom/Impact Scale (GODDESS) Desmoid Tumor Symptom Scale (DTSS) total symptom score; GODDESS Desmoid Tumor Impact Scale (DTIS) physical functioning domain score; and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 [EORTC QLQ-C30] global health status/quality of life, physical functioning, and role functioning scale scores.
Confirmed objective response rate (complete response + partial response) was 41% with nirogacestat versus 8% with placebo (p<0.001). The complete response rate was 7% in the nirogacestat arm and 0% in the placebo arm.
Nirogacestat demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PROs. Specifically, nirogacestat significantly reduced pain (p<0.001) and other desmoid tumor-specific symptoms (p<0.001) and also significantly improved physical/role functioning (p<0.001) and overall health-related quality of life (p=0.007). Most PRO benefits were observed as early as Cycle 2, which was the first timepoint for post-treatment evaluation, and were sustained over the duration of the study.
Nirogacestat exhibited a manageable safety profile in the DeFi trial, with 95% of all TEAEs reported as Grade 1 or 2. The below table lists all TEAEs (and corresponding grade ≥3 TEAEs) that were reported in greater than 25% of patients in either arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs in participants receiving nirogacestat as compared to the placebo arm were diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue. Forty-two percent of patients in the nirogacestat arm versus 0% in the placebo arm required dose reductions due to TEAEs, and 20% of patients in the nirogacestat arm versus 1% in the placebo arm discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. Ovarian dysfunction, which was defined by investigator-reported events of amenorrhea, premature menopause, menopause, and ovarian failure, was observed in 75% (27/36) of women of childbearing potential receiving nirogacestat. These events resolved in 74% (20/27) of the affected participants, including 64% (9/14) of such participants who remained on nirogacestat treatment and 100% (11/11) of those participants who discontinued treatment for any reason.

Ovarian granulosa cell tumors, or GCT, are the most common type of sex cord stromal tumor, accounting for approximately 5% of all ovarian cancers. These tumors can be divided into two subtypes: adult GCT and juvenile GCT, which occur in patients 
under the age of 30 years old. Approximately 95% of diagnosed GCT are adult GCT. Both subtypes are characterized by indolent growth, and the majority of adult GCT are diagnosed at an early stage. Symptoms of GCT include abdominal pain and abnormal vaginal bleeding, and some cases may also present with menorrhagia, irregular menstruation, or amenorrhea in women of reproductive age. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for GCT. Surgery is the primary treatment option and aims to achieve histological diagnosis, an appropriate staging and complete debulking of disease. In patients with early-stage disease and those in reproductive age, unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with peritoneal staging is indicated. In postmenopausal women and in those with more advanced disease, a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal biopsies and removal of all visible disease is the typical surgical treatment. Platinum-based chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are used in advanced or unresectable disease, although with modest benefit. However, the probability of recurrence in adult GCT patients is high, approximately 40%, typically occurring within the first 10 years of diagnosis. Therefore, additional treatment options are needed for recurrent disease. The annual incidence of GCT patients in the United States is approximately 1,500 to 2,000 patients.
A variety of cell signaling pathways, such as TGF-β, Notch and PI3K/AKT, are involved in the development of adult GCT. Approximately 97% of GCT are driven by a C124W mutation in the FOXL2 gene, which encodes for FOXL2 protein, a transcription factor required for the development and function of granulosa cells. Preclinical data have shown that the Notch system acts as a survival pathway in FOXL2-mutated granulosa tumor cell lines, inducing granulosa tumor cell proliferation and decreasing apoptosis-mediated cell death. Gamma secretase inhibitors have been shown to be inhibitors of the Notch signaling pathway. Preclinically, inhibition of the Notch pathway by a gamma secretase inhibitor was shown to decrease proliferation and viability of the FOXL2-mutated granulosa tumor cell line. Based on this rationale, we are clinically evaluating nirogacestat’s potential as a treatment for patients with GCT. In September 2022, we announced that the first patient had been dosed in a Phase 2 trial evaluating nirogacestat as a monotherapy in adult patients with recurrent GCT.
Nirogacestat in combination with BCMA-targeted agents
BCMA is a cell surface protein universally expressed on multiple myeloma, or MM, cells, and the clinical activity of monotherapy BCMA-targeted agents have been demonstrated in this indication. GSIs have been shown to increase BCMA expression on MM cells. Activity of this combination mechanism has been observed in multiple preclinical models of MM using BCMA-directed therapies in combination with GSIs as well as in initial clinical data. We believe this combination, as compared to BCMA-directed therapies alone, may provide a meaningful clinical benefit to MM patients by improving response rates, prolonging the duration of clinical benefit or reducing the side effect profile by enabling administration at a lower dose.
We are evaluating this novel combination therapy approach through clinical collaborations with several industry partners. In June 2019, we entered a clinical collaboration with GSK to explore the combination of nirogacestat with their BCMA-targeted ADC, belamaf, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, or RRMM. We believe that the clinical activity of BCMA-directed therapies, including belamaf, may be enhanced with the addition of a GSI, like nirogacestat. In June 2020, we announced the dosing of the first patient in an adaptive Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating the combination. Initial clinical data from the trial are expected in mid-2022. In October 2021, we announced the initiation of an expanded Phase 2 cohort from the first combination dose level that evaluated 0.95 mg/kg dose of belamaf every three weeks plus nirogacestat based on encouraging preliminary data observed in the Phase 1 cohort. We also announced the addition of two new sub-studies that will explore belamaf plus nirogacestat in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone and in combination with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in patients with RRMM. GSK is responsible for the conduct and expenses of the trial, which is governed by a joint development committee with equal representation from each party.
In September 2022, we entered into an expanded global, non-exclusive license and collaboration agreement with GSK for nirogacestat in combination with belantamab mafodotin (belamaf) in patients with multiple myeloma. The expanded agreement includes the potential for continued development and commercialization of the combination of belamaf and nirogacestat in earlier lines of treatment, including in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. We continue to retain full commercial rights to nirogacestat. Additionally, we will continue to supply nirogacestat for future belamaf clinical trials and will seek to make nirogacestat commercially available in markets where approval has been sought by GSK for a combination with belamaf. GSK funds all development costs related to the combination regimen study, except for those related to the supply of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights. We are responsible for costs to commercialize nirogacestat as part of the combination regimen. 
We have entered into other separate non-exclusive clinical collaborations with several industry partners, each of whom is developing one or more BCMA-targeted therapies. Each partner is responsible for the conduct and expenses of a clinical trial to evaluate the combination of nirogacestat with its respective BCMA agent in RRMM.
In addition to our clinical collaborations, in September 2020, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with Fred Hutch to further explore the ability of nirogacestat to modulate BCMA and potentiate BCMA-targeting therapies in a variety of preclinical and patient-derived multiple myeloma models developed by researchers at Fred Hutch, and in August 2021, we entered into a sponsored research collaboration with Dana-Farber to further investigate nirogacestat with BCMA-targeting therapies in a variety of preclinical multiple myeloma models.
Disease background – multiple myeloma
MM is a plasma cell neoplasm with substantial morbidity and mortality and is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the U.S. accounting for approximately 10% of all hematologic cancers. The NCI surveillance, epidemiology and end results program estimated that in 2016 there were approximately 130,000 patients in the U.S. living with MM. Of these, approximately 30,000 have relapsed or are refractory to currently available therapies, representing a patient population with few therapeutic options and therefore a significant unmet medical need. It was estimated that approximately 13,000 individuals in the U.S. died from MM in 2022.
MM is characterized by the expansion and abnormal accumulation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow, which disrupts normal bone marrow function and over time can lead to anemia, hypercalcemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, fatigue and weight loss. As the disease progresses, it destroys the surrounding bone marrow and can lead to renal failure, increased susceptibility to infection, skeletal deterioration and neurologic disease.
Current treatment landscape for MM
Treatment of MM has advanced significantly in the past decade driven by a deeper understanding of disease processes and a sequenced or polypharmacy approach. Newly diagnosed patients with MM are treated with either stem cell transplants or multiple classes of therapeutic agents, either alone or in combination, to attempt to control their disease progression. These agents include proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide, monoclonal antibodies such as daratumumab, histone deacetylase inhibitors such as panobinostat, alkylating agents such as melphalan, anti-inflammatories such as dexamethasone and chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin. Despite these current options, the durability of clinical response and benefit is often brief. As there are no therapies that currently are considered curative, nearly all patients who survive initial treatments are eventually deemed resistant or refractory to available therapies and their disease continues to progress. By the time these heavily pretreated patients reach this advanced state, they are often directed to clinical trials for treatment with experimental agents. Due to the advanced condition of these patients, the refractory nature of their disease and the toll prior treatments have taken on their health, responses to treatment are generally poor.
BCMA-directed agents have emerged as a potentially promising approach for the treatment of RRMM patients due to the restriction of BCMA’s expression solely on the surface of plasmablasts and differentiated plasma cells, with several such agents having received regulatory approval in the last few years. We are aware of at least 20 other distinct programs in preclinical and clinical development that target BCMA; these programs represent a variety of therapeutics modalities, including ADCs, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, autologous CAR T-cells and allogeneic CAR T-cells.
We are also aware of efforts by others to combine a GSI and a BCMA-directed agent to treat RRMM. Celgene, a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, is currently evaluating a BCMA-directed ADC, CC-99712, in combination with crenigacestat, a GSI licensed from Eli Lilly and Company in December 2017; this combination is currently in Phase 1 clinical testing. Celgene is also evaluating crenigacestat in combination with its approved autologous BCMA-directed CAR T-cell therapy, ABECMA (ide-cel), in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. 
Combination of nirogacestat and BCMA-targeted therapies
We believe that BCMA-targeted therapies will play an important role in the future treatment paradigm of MM, with each of our collaboration partners possessing particular advantages among the modalities being investigated to therapeutically target BCMA. ADCs and bispecific antibodies possess several attractive features, including conventional infusion schedules and standard pharmaceutical manufacturing, storage and administration processes. In addition, dosing of ADCs and bispecific antibodies can be readily modified throughout the course of treatment. Allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies have the benefit of potentially yielding profound clinical benefit using a one-time infusion of an ‘off-the-shelf’ cell therapy product. Physician and patient preference for a given BCMA-targeted therapy modality may depend upon the treatment setting in which a patient is receiving care, the clinical characteristics of a given patient and the efficacy and tolerability profile of the therapy.
Given our clinical experience with nirogacestat as well as its tolerability profile at doses we believe will be active in combination with BCMA-targeted therapies based upon preclinical MM models, we believe that nirogacestat could be a compelling and differentiated GSI for use in combination with a BCMA-directed therapy in MM. We believe that nirogacestat, by maintaining a high level of surface expression of BCMA on MM cells and by reducing peripheral antigen sink resulting from shed soluble BCMA extracellular domain, or ECD, has the potential to improve clinical outcomes compared to a BCMA-targeted therapy alone. In particular, we believe this combination has the potential to improve response rates, prolong the duration of clinical benefit or reduce the side effect profile by enabling administration of a BCMA-targeted therapy at a lower dose in combination with nirogacestat.
Combination mechanism of action
Gamma secretase has been shown to directly cleave membrane-bound BCMA, resulting in the release of the BCMA ECD from the cell surface. By inhibiting gamma secretase, membrane-bound BCMA can be preserved, increasing target density while reducing levels of soluble BCMA ECD, which may serve as decoy receptors. Nirogacestat’s ability to enhance the activity of BCMA-directed therapies has been observed in multiple preclinical models of MM, which was first presented in December 2019 at the 61st Annual American Society of Hematology meeting by our collaborator GSK in combination with belantamab mafodotin (belamaf), and in initial clinical data presented at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2021 by our collaborator, Precision Biosciences, and at the 2022 ASCO Annual Meeting by our collaborator, GSK.
The activity of BCMA-directed antibody-drug conjugates against BCMA-expressing MM cells is attributable to four potential mechanisms: (1) targeted delivery of its cytotoxic payload, (2) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, (3) BCMA receptor signaling inhibition due to blocking of ligand binding and (4) immunogenic cell death. The activity of allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies against BCMA-expressing MM cells is driven by direct T-cell mediated killing of BCMA expressing MM cells. The activity of BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibodies is driven by the recruitment and activation of T-cells to kill BCMA-expressing MM cells. The activity of monoclonal antibodies targeting BCMA is driven by the blocking of BCMA-mediated pro-survival and proliferative signaling, mediating antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, and enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.
The following graphic illustrates the effect of GSI (shown in combination with a BCMA directed ADC) on decreasing gamma secretase-mediated cleavage of membrane-bound BCMA, leading to increased density of target (BCMA) on cancer cells and reduced levels of decoy receptors (soluble BCMA ECD).
Mirdametinib
Overview
Mirdametinib is an investigational oral, small molecule inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2. MEK proteins occupy a pivotal position in the MAPK pathway, a key signaling network that regulates cell growth and survival, and that plays a central role in multiple oncology and rare disease indications.
We are initially investigating mirdametinib as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with NF1-PN, a rare disorder characterized by mutations in the MAPK pathway that lead to the growth of peripheral nerve sheath tumors, which cause significant pain, disfigurement and morbidity. In October 2018 and July 2019, the FDA and European Commission, respectively, granted mirdametinib Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of NF1, and in May 2019, the FDA granted mirdametinib Fast Track Designation for the treatment of NF1-PN.
A Phase 2 clinical trial was conducted by the Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trial Consortium, which evaluated mirdametinib in 19 NF1-PN patients. In this clinical trial, 42% of patients experienced an objective response (defined as at least a 20% volumetric reduction in their target PN tumor) by 12 months of treatment. Based on the strength of these data and our interactions with the FDA, we initiated our potentially registrational single-arm, open-label Phase 2b ReNeu clinical trial of mirdametinib in NF1-PN patients in October 2019. The primary endpoint for the ReNeu trial is ORR, with an objective response defined as at least a 20% reduction in tumor volume from baseline as determined by volumetric MRI assessment. If the results of this clinical trial are favorable, we plan to file for marketing approval for mirdametinib in the U.S. and select international markets, although specific countries have not yet been finally determined.
In addition to our monotherapy program in NF1-PN, we believe that mirdametinib holds promise for use in multiple targeted combination therapies in oncology and for the treatment of other genetically defined tumors. Our first such effort is evaluating mirdametinib in combination with BeiGene’s RAF dimer inhibitor, lifirafenib (BGB-283). In May 2019, we announced the initiation of an adaptive Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of this combination that is being conducted by BeiGene. This trial is currently enrolling patients in the U.S. and Australia with advanced or refractory solid tumors harboring relevant genetic mutations in the MAPK pathway, and we reported initial clinical data from this trial at our company-sponsored R&D Day in June 2022. In addition, we are evaluating mirdametinib in combination with fulvestrant in patients with estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer and as a monotherapy in patients with solid tumors harboring activating mutations in MEK1 or MEK2 in an ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial sponsored by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and supported by SpringWorks. In collaboration with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, we are evaluating mirdametinib for the treatment of pediatric and young adult patients with low-grade gliomas in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial.
Mirdametinib for treatment of NF1-PN
Disease background
NF1 is a rare, autosomal dominant tumor predisposition disorder that arises from mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes for neurofibromin, a key negative regulator of the MAPK pathway. NF1 is the most common form of neurofibromatosis, with an estimated global birth incidence of approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals. We estimate that there are approximately 100,000 patients living with NF1 in the U.S. NF1 is clinically heterogeneous and manifests in a variety of symptoms across numerous organ systems, including abnormal pigmentation, skeletal deformities, tumor growth and neurological complications, such as cognitive impairment. Patients with NF1 have a 15-year mean reduction in their life expectancy compared to the general population.
NF1 patients have an approximately 30% to 50% lifetime risk of developing plexiform neurofibromas, or PN, which are tumors that grow in an infiltrative pattern along the peripheral nerve sheath and that can cause severe disfigurement, pain and functional impairment; in rare cases, NF1-PN may be fatal. NF1-PN are most often diagnosed in the first two decades of life and can be confirmed using routine imaging techniques. These tumors are characterized by aggressive growth, which is typically more rapid during childhood. NF1-PN typically do not spontaneously regress.
While NF1-PN are benign, these tumors can undergo malignant transformation, leading to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, or MPNST. NF1 patients have an 8% to 15% lifetime risk of developing MPNST, a diagnosis that carries with it a 12-month survival rate of under 50%. In addition to MPNST, NF1 patients are at an increased risk of developing other malignancies, including breast cancer and gliomas.
Current treatment landscape for NF1-PN
A MEK inhibitor, Koselugo (selumetinib), was approved by the FDA in April 2020 for the treatment of pediatric patients two years of age and older with NF1 who have symptomatic, inoperable PN and is also being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of adult patients with NF1 who have symptomatic, inoperable PN. While surgical resection is another treatment option for NF1-PN patients, wide margins are required to resect the tumors, and this is an outcome that can rarely be achieved in NF1-PN patients. This is because NF1-PN arise from nerve cells and grow in an infiltrative pattern, making it challenging to successfully resect tumors without severe comorbidities, such as permanent nerve damage and disfigurement. Patients that are ineligible for surgery or those who have had a recurrence post-surgery are often treated with a 
variety of off-label therapies. Among these off-label therapies are various systemic treatments, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy, which have not been shown to consistently confer a clinical benefit.
The inadequacy of surgery highlights the need for improved systemic therapies. Given that NF1-PN is driven by overactivation of the MAPK pathway, MEK inhibitors have emerged as a class of therapies that hold significant promise for the treatment of NF1-PN, and we believe that MEK inhibitors have the potential to become the standard of care.
In addition to Koselugo, we are aware of at least two other MEK inhibitors in Phase 2 investigator-sponsored clinical trials for this indication, including a MEK inhibitor approved for other oncology indications that is sometimes used off-label in NF1-PN patients. Given the lifelong and devastating nature of NF1-PN, as well as the need to begin treating patients at a young age, we believe that the optimal MEK inhibitor is one that will have a tolerability profile suitable for long-term dosing while simultaneously arresting or reversing tumor growth.
Mirdametinib for the treatment of NF1-PN
Mirdametinib is an investigational oral, small molecule inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, which we are developing as a monotherapy in NF1-PN. Based on results from prior clinical trials, we believe that mirdametinib, using the dose and schedule from the NF1-PN Phase 2 clinical trial, has the potential to offer a potentially best-in-class profile in order to enable the long-term treatment required for this patient population, as compared to other MEK inhibitors. Given the clinical activity and tolerability profile observed with mirdametinib in the previous NF1-PN clinical trial, and following our discussions with the FDA, we designed our ongoing potentially registrational Phase 2b clinical trial, or the ReNeu trial, in a manner that we believe has the potential to generate sufficient data to support approval in both pediatric and adult NF1-PN patients. If the results of the ReNeu trial are favorable, we plan to file for marketing approval for mirdametinib in the U.S. and select international markets, although specific countries have not yet been finally determined.
Mechanism of action
Neurofibromin is a critical repressor of RAS signaling and is impaired in patients with a mutated NF1 gene, resulting in constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. MEK inhibitors can reduce MAPK pathway activity and therefore arrest or reverse NF1-PN growth, which has been observed clinically with several MEK inhibitors, including mirdametinib.
Clinical development of mirdametinib for NF1-PN
Mirdametinib has shown clinical activity in a previous Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by the Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trial Consortium that enrolled 19 adolescent and adult NF1-PN patients, and data from this clinical trial were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2021. Patients received an oral dose of 2 mg/m2 BID with a maximum dose of 4 mg BID (without regard to food) on a four-week cycle of three weeks-on, one week-off. Eight patients (42%) achieved an objective response by cycle 12, prospectively defined as a volumetric reduction in their target PN of at least 20%, and 10 patients (53%) had stable disease. Mirdametinib was generally well tolerated in this trial, with no Grade 4 or Grade 5 adverse events reported. Two treatment-related Grade 3 events, occurring in the same patient, were reported. The most common adverse events of any grade were acneiform rash (95%), fatigue (58%), and nausea (53%). Given the activity and tolerability of mirdametinib in this clinical trial, we are utilizing the same dose and schedule in our potentially registrational Phase 2b ReNeu trial. Furthermore, based on discussions with the FDA, we enrolled pediatric NF1-PN patients, in addition to adolescent and adult patients.
Mirdametinib has been tested in monotherapy clinical trials across a broad dose range (from 1 mg QD to 30 mg BID), with the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, determined to be 15 mg BID and the recommended Phase 2 dose determined to be 10 mg BID administered on a five days-on, two days-off schedule.
To date, the safety profile of monotherapy mirdametinib in patients with advanced cancers at doses lower than 10 mg BID using an intermittent schedule has been characterized by mostly manageable and reversible toxicities, and mirdametinib is observed to be generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported of these adverse events have been rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fatigue.
Phase 2b ReNeu trial in NF1-PN
Given the degree of clinical benefit observed in patients with NF1-PN in the previous Phase 2 clinical trial of mirdametinib, and informed by our discussions with the FDA, we initiated the potentially registrational ReNeu clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2019. The ReNeu trial is a Phase 2b, longitudinal, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of mirdametinib in patients at least two years of age with an inoperable NF1-PN that is causing significant morbidity 
16


or major deformity. The ReNeu trial is being conducted at clinical sites in North America. As in the previous Phase 2 clinical trial in NF1-PN patients, mirdametinib is being administered orally at a 2 mg/m2 BID dose with a maximum dose of 4 mg BID (without regard to food). Dosing is occurring on a four-week cycle with a three weeks-on, one week-off schedule. The intervention period will last for up to 24 cycles. In contrast to the previous Phase 2 clinical trial, we have designed our ReNeu trial with an intervention period that we believe is optimized to demonstrate the full antitumor activity of mirdametinib in NF1-PN patients.
In November 2021, we announced full enrollment of the Phase 2b ReNeu trial, with over 50 adults and over 50 pediatric patients with NF1-PN enrolled. The primary endpoint is ORR measured using three-dimensional MRI volumetric analysis and assessed by blinded independent central review, or BICR. As in the previous Phase 2 clinical trial, an objective response is defined as a decrease of at least 20% in tumor volume in the target NF1-PN by BICR. Key secondary endpoints include the duration of response and health-related quality-of-life measurements. We expect to report topline data for the ReNeu trial in the second half of 2023.
Interim clinical data
In February 2021, we reported interim clinical data from the first 20 adult patients enrolled in the Phase 2b ReNeu trial and in June 2021, we presented updated data from these 20 patients at the Children’s Tumor Foundation NF Conference. Demographics and baseline characteristics of these patients are shown in the table below.

As of the data cut-off date of March 23, 2021, 10 of these 20 patients (50%) had achieved an objective response, as assessed by a reduction of at least 20% in tumor volume by BICR. The following chart shows the best percent change in tumor volume from baseline in these first 20 adult patients. Seven of the 10 patients who achieved an initial objective response had confirmed partial responses.

The duration of treatment for the 20 patients evaluated is shown in the chart below. As of the March 23, 2021 data cut-off, 16 patients (80%) remained on therapy and four patients discontinued treatment with one due to disease progression, one due to an adverse event of Grade 1 diarrhea, one participant decision and one patient being unable to undergo the required MRI imaging due to a titanium rod implant from non-treatment related worsening of scoliosis. At the time of data cut-off, the median time on treatment for these 20 patients was 13 cycles (approximately 12 months) and all 10 patients who had achieved an objective response remained on therapy.

MAPK Pathway Programs
Overview
We have several monotherapy and combination therapy approaches in development for the treatment of solid tumors with mutations in the MAPK pathway. These approaches include the combination of mirdametinib with BeiGene’s RAF dimer inhibitor, lifirafenib, as well as a monotherapy approach with BGB-3245, an investigational oral, selective small molecule inhibitor of monomeric and dimeric forms of activating BRAF mutations through MapKure, which is jointly owned by us and BeiGene to treat patients with solid tumors harboring RAS or RAF mutations.
We are also evaluating mirdametinib for the treatment of solid tumors harboring other MAPK aberrations in collaboration with academic institutions. Ongoing academic-sponsored trials supported by SpringWorks include a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in children and young adults with low-grade glioma sponsored by St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and a Phase 1b/2a platform study sponsored by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center with two patient cohorts: the first evaluating mirdametinib in combination with fulvestrant, a selective estrogen receptor degrader in patients with estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer with MAPK alterations (particularly inactivating mutations in NF1), and the second evaluating mirdametinib as a monotherapy in advanced solid tumors harboring oncogenic MEK1 or MEK2 mutations.
Disease background
Overview of the MAPK pathway
The MAPK pathway, which relies upon the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade, represents a central biological pathway in all human cells that is responsible for helping to regulate cellular transcription, proliferation and survival. The general structure of the pathway consists of RAS, a small GTPase, and three downstream protein kinases, RAF, MEK and ERK. In addition, at the level of RAS, the pathway is negatively regulated by several proteins, including neurofibromin, the protein encoded by the NF1 gene. Given its direct regulation of ERK, which directly controls downstream signaling through the MAPK pathway, MEK occupies a pivotal position in this signaling cascade and represents a rational therapeutic target for addressing indications where overactivation of the MAPK pathway contributes significantly to disease onset and/or progression.
Constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway has been reported in approximately 25% of human cancers, including colon, lung, breast, pancreatic, ovarian and renal tumors. The cause of pathway activation is varied and tissue-specific, but is driven by one or more of the following mechanisms, each of which is depicted in the illustration below: (i) upstream activation of one or more receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR, (ii) mutations in a RAS isoform, such as KRAS and (iii) other mutations or aberrations within the pathway, such as in BRAF and NF1.
We believe that by vertically inhibiting two key, adjacent constituents of the MAPK pathway, the combination of mirdametinib and a RAF inhibitor, such as lifirafenib or BGB-3245, can potentially address the resistance mechanisms and feedback loops that have prevented development of therapies for many devastating cancers harboring MAPK pathway gene mutations, such as those in RAS, RAF and NF1.
Currently approved RAF inhibitors were designed to address tumors whose growth is reliant upon signaling via monomeric forms of BRAF, such as those with BRAF V600 mutations, a subset of MAPK aberrations commonly found in metastatic melanoma. In this setting, the addition of a MEK inhibitor to a BRAF V600 inhibitor showed significant clinical activity beyond monotherapy BRAF inhibition. By targeting both monomeric and dimeric forms of RAF, RAF dimer inhibitors, such as lifirafenib, are designed to work in tumors beyond just those harboring BRAF V600 mutations and therefore have the potential 
to address a much broader range of genetically defined patient populations. This includes RAS-mutant cancers, which predominantly signal through hetero- and homodimeric RAF; both of these conformations are potentially addressed by lifirafenib.
RAS mutations
RAS mutations are one of the most common genetic aberrations found in human cancers and these driver mutations are found in approximately 25% of all solid tumors, representing over 200,000 new patients diagnosed in the U.S. each year. RAS proteins, which are comprised of the KRAS, HRAS and NRAS isoforms, are central to the transduction of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and lead to downstream activation of the canonical RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade of the MAPK pathway.
We believe that effective therapies for patients harboring RAS mutations represent a significant clinical need. To date, MEK or RAF inhibitors used as monotherapies have generally demonstrated only limited clinical activity in patients whose tumors harbor RAS mutations. These tumors are generally poorly responsive to targeted therapies and RAS mutations typically confer poor prognosis, although outcomes can vary across different cancer types with RAS mutations.
RAF mutations
RAF mutations have been reported in up to 7% of all solid tumors, with the most widely described being the BRAF V600 mutations, commonly found in patients with metastatic melanoma. While there are approved MEK-RAF targeted combination therapies for patients with BRAF V600 mutations, patients eventually progress on these therapies representing a significant unmet clinical need.
In addition, there have been numerous non-V600 BRAF mutations described, which are not responsive to the currently approved therapies, and the use of the existing therapies has been shown to paradoxically increase the ability of tumor cells with these non-V600 BRAF mutations to proliferate.
Other MAPK aberrations
Patients with mutations and aberrations in the MAPK pathway aside from RAS and RAF mutations also represent a substantial unmet clinical need owing to a lack of approved therapies. Such tumors include malignant cancers driven by NF1 mutations, such as MPNST.
Current treatment landscape
There are currently two approved therapies for the treatment of solid tumors with a specific RAS-mutation. In May 2021, Amgen Inc.’s LUMAKRAS (sotorasib), a RAS GTPase family inhibitor, received accelerated approval from the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. In December 2022, Mirati Therapeutics, Inc.’s KRAZATI (adagrasib), a RAS GTPase family inhibitor, received accelerated approval from the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. In addition to LUMAKRAS and KRAZATI, there are currently multiple programs in clinical development for RAS-mutant solid tumors that are evaluating various mechanisms of action and targeting specific RAS mutations.
For RAF mutations, we are not aware of any therapies currently approved by the FDA for treatment of patients harboring non-V600 BRAF mutations. There are several approved therapies in indications where RAF mutations are frequent, though none are designed to address RAF mutations aside from those therapies targeting BRAF V600 mutations, and even for these an unmet medical need exists because patients eventually progress on these therapies.
For patients whose tumors harbor other MAPK aberrations, we are not aware of any therapies currently approved by the FDA. There are several approved therapies in indications where we believe such MAPK pathway aberrations are frequent, though these therapies are not specifically designed to address these aberrations.
Combination of mirdametinib and lifirafenib in MAPK-mutant solid tumors
Preclinical data with the combination of mirdametinib and lifirafenib demonstrating antitumor activity in RAS mutant cancer models were presented at the 2015 American Association for Cancer Research, or AACR, Conferences. A variety of MEK inhibitors were evaluated in combination with lifirafenib in this preclinical study, and mirdametinib was observed to be among the MEK inhibitors with the highest synergy and the most potent antitumor activity in combination. Additional preclinical data 
from studies of mirdametinib in combination with lifirafenib presented at the 2020 AACR Virtual Annual Meeting II demonstrated potent and synergistic activity in vitro and in vivo across a panel of cancer models harboring a variety of RAS mutations. BeiGene’s lifirafenib has demonstrated antitumor activity as a monotherapy in a completed Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with RAS and RAF mutated solid tumors and was observed to be generally well tolerated.
In May 2019, we announced the initiation of an adaptive Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of mirdametinib and lifirafenib. This clinical trial is enrolling patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors harboring relevant genetic mutations in the MAPK pathway. This clinical trial is being conducted by BeiGene in collaboration with us in both the U.S. and Australia. The clinical trial is comprised of two stages. In the first stage, we intend to determine the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose of the combination therapy. In the second stage, the trial is expected to enroll expansion cohorts comprised of patients with tumor types and mutational backgrounds of interest, which may include non-small cell lung cancer and endometrial cancer with KRAS mutations, to assess antitumor efficacy, safety and tolerability of the combination therapy at the recommended Phase 2 dose. Initial clinical data from the ongoing trial was presented at our company-sponsored R&D Day in June 2022, demonstrating proof-of-concept.
BGB-3245 in genetically defined BRAF-mutant solid tumors
In June 2019, we announced the formation of MapKure, which is jointly owned by us and BeiGene. BeiGene licensed to MapKure exclusive rights to BGB-3245, a novel, investigational oral, selective small molecule inhibitor of monomeric and dimeric forms of activating BRAF mutations, including V600 BRAF mutations, non-V600 BRAF mutations and RAF fusions. MapKure is advancing BGB-3245 through clinical development for solid tumor patients harboring BRAF driver mutations and BRAF fusions that were observed to be sensitive to the compound in preclinical studies. In February 2020 MapKure, BeiGene and SpringWorks announced the initiation of a Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion clinical trial evaluating BGB-3245 in adult patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors harboring specific genetic mutations that based on preclinical results are predicted to be sensitive to treatment with BGB-3245. Initial clinical data from the ongoing trial was presented at our company-sponsored R&D Day in June 2022, demonstrating proof-of-concept. We expect to present additional monotherapy data from the Phase 1 trial at a medical conference in the first half of 2023. In February 2023, the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1/2a open-label, dose escalation and expansion trial evaluating mirdametinib in combination with BGB-3245 in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring MAPK-activating mutations.
In addition to our significant, but non-controlling equity ownership in MapKure, we have one seat on each of MapKure’s joint steering committee and its board of directors. We are also contributing to the clinical development of BGB-3245 and other operational activities through a service agreement with MapKure.
Based on preclinical data, we believe that BGB-3245 may be unique in its BRAF binding and disassociation properties, potentially enabling differentiated antitumor activity as compared to other known RAF inhibitors. We believe this may better position BGB-3245 for clinical development as a monotherapy in certain biomarker defined patient populations. These biomarkers include de novo Class 2 BRAF mutations, de novo BRAF fusions and BRAF resistance mutations following treatment with BRAF V600 inhibitors.
To date, approximately 200 unique mutant BRAF alleles have been identified in human tumors. Activating BRAF mutations have been categorized into three classes: Class 1 mutants, comprised of constitutively active monomers, such as V600E mutations, Class 2 mutants, comprised of constitutively active dimers, and Class 3 mutants, which are kinase-impaired or kinase-dead. Today, only Class 1 BRAF mutations have any approved targeted therapeutic options, such as vemurafenib, dabrafenib and encorafenib for the treatment of BRAF V600E/K-mutant metastatic melanoma. The following table summarizes the distribution of BRAF mutations that have been described in the scientific literature as of 2017.
Despite the clinical activity of approved BRAF inhibitors in patients with Class 1 BRAF mutations, emerging evidence suggests that resistance commonly develops via mutations that enable ligand independent signaling by dimerization of the protein, such as p61 BRAF V600E and BRAF V600E/L514V, which represent an area of unmet medical need. BGB-3245 has demonstrated preclinical activity against these mutations.
Furthermore, BRAF fusion proteins have recently been described as drivers of cancer cell growth, and patients can now be screened for such fusions in the clinical setting. Recent literature suggests that these mutations may account for 0.3% of all human cancers, with 20 novel BRAF fusions now identified across 12 distinct tumor types, with enrichment in specific cancers. We believe that BGB-3245 may also address patients with these BRAF fusions.
Mirdametinib for the treatment of other MAPK-aberrant solid tumors
We are also evaluating mirdametinib for the treatment of solid tumors harboring other MAPK aberrations, in both monotherapy and combination approaches. In June 2021, we announced the initiation of Phase 1/2 clinical trial of mirdametinib in children and young adults with low-grade glioma. The study is sponsored by St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and supported by SpringWorks. Initial data from the Phase 1 dose escalation study were presented at the International Symposium on Pediatric Neuro-Oncology 2022 meeting. In August 2021, we announced the evaluation of mirdametinib in a Phase 1b/2a platform study sponsored by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and supported by SpringWorks to explore the compound both as a monotherapy and as a combination therapy in advanced solid tumors harboring MAPK-activating mutations. The trial, which initiated in the third quarter of 2021, is initially exploring mirdametinib in two patient cohorts: the first in combination with fulvestrant, a selective estrogen receptor degrader in patients with estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer with MAPK alterations (particularly inactivating mutations in NF1), and the second as a monotherapy in advanced solid tumors harboring oncogenic MEK1 or MEK2 mutations.
License and collaboration agreements
Pfizer license agreements
We were originally conceived by Pfizer as an innovative way to advance investigational therapies that may hold significant promise for underserved patients. Pfizer initially made an equity investment and also contributed royalty- and milestone-bearing product licenses, including for our two lead product candidates, nirogacestat and mirdametinib.
Nirogacestat license agreement
In August 2017, we entered into a license agreement, or the Nirogacestat License Agreement, with Pfizer, pursuant to which we acquired exclusive (including as to Pfizer) worldwide sublicensable rights to research, develop and manufacture nirogacestat for the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of all diseases and commercialize nirogacestat for the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of all diseases other than Alzheimer’s disease, breast cancer and prostate cancer. Additionally, Pfizer agreed that, for ten years, it would not conduct a clinical trial of a gamma secretase inhibitor for desmoid tumors. Pfizer retained rights to commercialize nirogacestat for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, breast cancer and prostate cancer. We subsequently amended the Nirogacestat License Agreement in July 2019 with regard to certain provisions relating to intellectual property.
Pursuant to the Nirogacestat License Agreement, as amended, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for at least one product in the U.S. and if regulatory approval is obtained, to commercialize such product in the U.S. If, following regulatory approval in the U.S., we reasonably anticipate that the product will receive a certain level of reimbursement in certain countries, then we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for the product in such country and if regulatory approval is obtained, to commercialize such product in such country.
We are required to pay Pfizer up to an aggregate of $232.5 million upon achievement of certain commercial milestone events.
We will pay Pfizer tiered royalties on sales of nirogacestat at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the low 20s, that may be subject to deductions for expiration of valid claims, amounts due under third-party licenses and generic competition.
Unless earlier terminated, the Nirogacestat License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of all royalty obligations. The royalty period will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) ten years from the first commercial sale, (ii) the expiration of all regulatory or data exclusivity and (iii) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid patent claim. Following expiration of the applicable royalty period for a country, we will continue to have a perpetual, fully paid-up, non-exclusive license to all IP licensed during the royalty period for such country. We have the right to terminate the Nirogacestat License Agreement for convenience upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice. Pfizer may not terminate the agreement for convenience. Either we or Pfizer may terminate the Nirogacestat License Agreement if the other party is in material breach and such breach is not cured within the specified cure period. In addition, either we or Pfizer may terminate the Nirogacestat License Agreement in the event of specified insolvency events involving the other party. If Pfizer terminates the agreement as a result of our uncured material breach or our insolvency, Pfizer retains its license with respect to targets for which it has exercised an option (unless Pfizer elects otherwise), subject to reduced payment obligations.
Mirdametinib license agreement
In August 2017, we entered into a license agreement, or the Mirdametinib License Agreement with Pfizer pursuant to which we acquired exclusive (including as to Pfizer) worldwide sublicensable rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize mirdametinib for the treatment of all diseases. Additionally, Pfizer agreed, that for ten years, it will not conduct a clinical trial with a MEK inhibitor for NF1, but excluding a MEK inhibitor owned or controlled by a third party that acquires, or is acquired by, Pfizer. We subsequently amended the Mirdametinib License Agreement in August 2019 with regard to certain provisions relating to intellectual property.
Pursuant to the Mirdametinib License Agreement, as amended, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for at least one product in the U.S. and if regulatory approval is obtained, to commercialize such product in the U.S. If, following regulatory approval in the U.S., we reasonably anticipate that the product will receive a certain level of reimbursement in certain countries, then we will use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for the product in such country and if regulatory approval is obtained, to commercialize such product in such country.
We are required to pay Pfizer up to an aggregate of $229.8 million upon achievement of certain commercial milestone events.
We will pay Pfizer tiered royalties on sales of mirdametinib at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the low 20s, that may be subject to deductions for expiration of valid claims, amounts due under third-party licenses and generic competition.
Unless earlier terminated, the Mirdametinib License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of all royalty obligations. The royalty period will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) ten years from the first commercial sale, (ii) the expiration of all regulatory or data exclusivity and (iii) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid patent claim. Following expiration of the applicable royalty period for a country, we will continue to have a perpetual, fully paid-up, non-exclusive license to all IP licensed during the royalty period for such country. We have the right to terminate the Mirdametinib License Agreement for convenience upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice. Pfizer may not terminate the agreement for convenience. Either we or Pfizer may terminate the Mirdametinib License Agreement if the other party is in material breach and such breach is not cured within the specified cure period. In addition, either we or Pfizer may terminate the Mirdametinib License Agreement in the event of specified insolvency events involving the other party. If Pfizer terminates the agreement as a result of our uncured material breach or our insolvency, Pfizer retains its license with respect to targets for which it has exercised an option (unless Pfizer elects otherwise), subject to reduced payment obligations.
BeiGene clinical collaboration agreement
In August 2018, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with BeiGene, the BeiGene Collaboration Agreement, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of combining BeiGene’s investigational RAF dimer inhibitor, lifirafenib (BGB-283), and mirdametinib, in a Phase 1b clinical trial for patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors.
We and BeiGene are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our respective activities for the clinical trial. BeiGene is responsible for administering the clinical trial and we are responsible for performing the fixed dose formulation activities at our cost. Each party will be solely responsible for its costs associated with manufacturing and supply of its compound for the clinical trial. Upon completion of the clinical trial, if the parties agree that certain pre-defined criteria have been satisfied, the parties will negotiate in good faith a definitive agreement to provide for the expansion of the clinical collaboration and a commercial relationship based on specified principles, provided that neither party is obligated to enter into such definitive agreement.
We will share with BeiGene equally the costs associated with the clinical trial. The collaboration is managed by a joint steering committee of equal representation from us and BeiGene.
During a specified exclusivity period, neither party will develop or commercialize the other party’s compound. Further, for a certain period following the effective date of the agreement, neither party will clinically develop (or prepare to clinically develop) or commercialize the combination of certain inhibitors in any form, or any products containing any such combination, except as permitted by the BeiGene Collaboration Agreement.
Unless earlier terminated, the BeiGene Collaboration Agreement will expire on the one-year anniversary of the date that BeiGene provides the final clinical trial report for the clinical trial to us. Either party may terminate the BeiGene Collaboration Agreement as follows: (i) either party entirely ceases all development of its compound, (ii) either party reasonably concludes that there is a patient safety issue or (iii) if a regulatory authority withdraws approval for either party’s compound or the clinical trial. Either party may also terminate the BeiGene Collaboration Agreement if the other party is in material breach and such breach is not cured within the specified cure period.
GlaxoSmithKline clinical collaboration agreement and amendment
In June 2019, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with GSK, the GSK Collaboration Agreement, to evaluate nirogacestat in combination with belantamab mafodotin (belamaf), GSK’s BCMA ADC, in an adaptive Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with RRMM.
In October 2021, we amended the GSK Collaboration Agreement to add additional dosing regimens to the ongoing clinical trial evaluating the combination of nirogacestat and belamaf and to collaborate on additional trials evaluating the combination with other pharmaceutical agents for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. With this amendment, we announced the initiation of an expanded Phase 2 cohort from the first combination dose level that evaluated 0.95 mg/kg Q3W belamaf plus nirogacestat based on encouraging preliminary data observed in the Phase 1 cohort. The expanded Phase 2 cohort is further exploring the safety and efficacy profile compared to a 2.5 mg/kg Q3W belamaf monotherapy control arm, which is the same as the FDA approved monotherapy dose and schedule of belamaf. We also announced the addition of two new sub-studies that will explore belamaf plus nirogacestat in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone and in combination with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in patients with RRMM. We believe that data from these sub-studies may enable future clinical trials in earlier lines of multiple myeloma. The amendment did not amend or modify the operational or financial responsibilities of the parties.
In September 2022, we expanded the GSK Collaboration Agreement to include the potential for continued development and commercialization of the combination of belamaf and nirogacestat in earlier lines of treatment, including in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. Under the expanded agreement, we continue to retain full commercial rights to nirogacestat. Additionally, we will continue to supply nirogacestat for future belamaf clinical trials and will seek to make nirogacestat commercially available in markets where approval has been sought by GSK for a combination with belamaf. GSK funds all development costs related to the combination regimen study, except for those related to the supply of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights. We are responsible for costs to commercialize nirogacestat as part of the combination regimen.
Other clinical collaboration agreements related to nirogacestat and BCMA-directed therapy combination development
In addition to the GSK Collaboration Agreement, we have entered into several other clinical trial collaboration and supply agreements with industry partners to evaluate nirogacestat in combination with BCMA-directed therapies of various modalities, including CAR T-cell therapies, bispecific antibodies and monoclonal antibodies, in patients with RRMM. 
Each partner is responsible for administering the clinical trials to evaluate its respective BCMA-directed therapy in combination with nirogacestat and is responsible for all costs associated with the direct conduct of the clinical trial, other than the manufacture and supply of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights. Each collaboration is managed by a joint committee of our representatives and those of the respective partners. 
Unless earlier terminated, each collaboration agreement will expire upon completion of the analyses contemplated by the clinical trial. Either we or the respective counterparty may terminate the collaboration agreement for other reasons specified within the collaboration agreement.
Jazz Pharmaceuticals asset purchase and exclusive license agreement
In October 2020, we announced an asset purchase and exclusive license agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited, or Jazz, the Jazz Agreement, pursuant to which Jazz acquired our fatty acid amide hydrolase, or FAAH, inhibitor program including PF-04457845. Jazz made an upfront payment of $35 million to us with potential future payments of up to $375 million based upon the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. In addition, Jazz is obligated to pay us sales-based royalties on future net sales of PF-04457845.
Pursuant to the Jazz Agreement, Jazz is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for at least one product in the U.S. and if regulatory approval is obtained, to commercialize such product in the U.S.
Unless earlier terminated, the Jazz Agreement shall remain in effect on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the royalty term for such product in such country, as defined in the Jazz Agreement. Either party may terminate the Jazz Agreement if either party commits a material breach of the Jazz Agreement that is not cured within a certain time period. Jazz may terminate the Jazz Agreement for any reason so long as it provides advance written notice to us as specified in such agreement.
TEAD inhibitor portfolio license agreement
In May 2021, we announced an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, or KU Leuven, and the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology, or VIB, pursuant to which we in-licensed a portfolio of novel small molecule inhibitors of the TEA Domain, or TEAD, family of transcription factors, designed for the potential treatment of biomarker-defined solid tumors driven by aberrant Hippo pathway signaling. Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $11 million to KU Leuven and VIB. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, KU Leuven and VIB are also eligible to receive up to $285 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones and tiered single-digit percentage royalties based on any future net sales of products developed based on the in-licensed technology.
EGFR inhibitor portfolio license agreement and sponsored research agreement
In October 2021, we announced an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, or Dana-Farber, pursuant to which we in-licensed a portfolio of novel small molecule inhibitors of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, or EGFR, designed for the treatment of EGFR-mutant lung cancers. Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment to Dana-Farber. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Dana-Farber is also eligible to receive development and commercial milestones and royalties based on any future net sales of products developed based on the in-licensed technology.
Concurrent with this license agreement, we entered a multi-year sponsored research agreement with Stanford Medicine to fund continued research and development in a laboratory at Stanford Medicine as well as collaborating laboratories at Dana-Farber. This sponsored research agreement is intended to support lead optimization and translational biology efforts as the EGFR inhibitor portfolio advances towards development candidate nomination.
Manufacturing
We rely on third parties to manufacture all of our assets. We have entered into agreements with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce drug substance and drug product for the nirogacestat, mirdametinib and TEAD programs. We require all of our CMOs to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. We currently rely solely on these CMOs for scale-up and process development work and to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials. We anticipate that these CMOs will have the capacity to support both clinical supply and commercial-scale production. We have entered into agreements for the commercial supply of nirogacestat drug substance and finished product. We intend to seek to enter into such arrangements, including potentially for back-up sources of supply, on a timely basis in light of anticipated commercial needs.
Sales and marketing
If any of our product candidates are approved, we intend to market and commercialize them in the U.S. and select international markets, either alone or in partnership with others.
Many desmoid tumor and NF1-PN patients are managed by specialist physicians, including oncologists, medical geneticists and neurologists, and therefore we believe can be reached with a targeted sales force.
For our product candidates being explored in combination with other agents or in highly prevalent diseases, we intend to establish commercialization strategies for each in collaboration with our partner as we approach potential marketing approval and will share responsibilities in a manner that takes into account our respective commercial infrastructures, competencies and country-specific expertise.
Educational and patient initiatives
We actively collaborate with desmoid tumor and NF1-PN constituents through a number of initiatives, including participation in patient meetings and educational initiatives. Examples of such constituents include the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation, COG and Children’s Tumor Foundation. We undertake these activities in order to better understand the burdens and unmet needs these patients face so that we can more effectively facilitate their access to our product candidates, if approved. In each of these disease areas we will support disease awareness and diagnosis and subsequent treatment of identified patients, by providing information, increasing physician awareness and creating more efficient referral pathways. In furtherance of these objectives, we have launched a broad multi-channel company-sponsored disease education campaign for desmoid tumors to support patients, physicians, and caregivers.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid evolution of technologies and intense competition. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others.
Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with approved treatment options, including off-label therapies, and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key considerations that would impact our ability to effectively compete with other therapies include the efficacy, safety, method of administration, cost, level of promotional activity and intellectual property protection of our products. Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products.
Nirogacestat in Desmoid Tumors
There are no therapies currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of desmoid tumors. We are aware that other companies are, or may be, developing products for this indication, including, but not limited to, Ayala Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bayer Corporation, Cellestia Biotech AG and Iterion Therapeutics, Inc. We are also aware of several therapies, some of which are 
generic, that are used off-label for the treatment of desmoid tumors. These therapies include chemotherapeutic agents, such as liposomal doxorubicin and vinblastine/methotrexate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-hormonal therapies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib, imatinib and pazopanib.
Mirdametinib in NF1-PN
AstraZeneca PLC’s Koselugo is currently the only therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of NF1-PN. We are aware that other companies are, or may be, developing products for this indication, including, but not limited to, Array BioPharma Inc. (a subsidiary of Pfizer), Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Exelixis, Inc., Infixion Bioscience, Inc., NFlection Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis International AG, Pasithea Therapeutics Corp. and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. We are also aware of several therapies, some of which are generic, that are used off-label for the treatment of NF1-PN. These therapies include radiotherapy and various systemic treatments, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
BCMA-Targeted Therapies and GSI Combinations in Multiple Myeloma
For the treatment of multiple myeloma, we are aware that other companies are or may be developing other gamma secretase inhibitors in combination with BCMA-targeted therapies. This includes, but is not limited to, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.
Mirdametinib and BGB-3245 in MAPK-aberrant Cancers
For our biomarker-defined solid tumor portfolio, we are aware that other companies are or may be developing products for the treatment of solid tumors with specific mutations or aberrations that are being targeted by our programs. Multiple products are in development targeting RAS mutations, RAF mutations and other MAPK aberrations, including, but not limited to, those from Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Black Diamond Therapeutics, Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, Day One Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Erasca, Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Fore Biotherapeutics Inc., Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Kinnate Biopharma Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., Moderna Inc., Novartis International AG, Pfizer, Revolution Medicines, Inc., TheRas, Inc. and Wellspring Biosciences, Inc. There may be additional companies with programs suitable for addressing these patient populations that could be competitive with our efforts but that have not yet disclosed specific clinical development plans.
TEAD Inhibitor Program
We are aware of other TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors in early-stage development, including, but not limited to, product candidates from Cedilla Therapeutics, Ikena Oncology, Inc., Inventiva S.A., Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., Genentech, Inc. and Vivace Therapeutics, Inc. 
Smaller or early-stage companies, including oncology-focused therapeutics companies, may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, enrolling patients in clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The availability of reimbursement from government and private payors will also significantly impact the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approvals for our product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to commercialize our product candidates.
Intellectual property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We plan to protect our proprietary position using a variety of methods, which include pursuit of U.S. and foreign patent applications related to proprietary technology, inventions and improvements, such as compositions of matter and methods-of-use, that we determine are important to the development and implementation of our business. For example, we, our licensors, or our collaborators currently have, or are pursuing, patents covering the composition of matter for our product candidates and we plan to generally pursue patent protection covering methods-of-use for one or more clinical programs. We also rely on trade secrets, trademarks, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Patents
At the time we were formed in August 2017, we entered into license agreements with Pfizer for our lead product candidates, pursuant to which we acquired exclusive worldwide rights under Pfizer patents and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize our lead product candidates.
We have exclusive licenses under the Nirogacestat License Agreement to patent rights in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to nirogacestat. The patent rights in-licensed under the Nirogacestat License Agreement include six granted patents in the U.S. (with the agreement originally covering three such patents, and three additional patents having been subsequently granted based on work conducted by us and with Pfizer’s consent) and more than 25 patents granted in foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan. U.S. patents covering nirogacestat as a composition of matter have a statutory expiration date in 2025, U.S. patents that cover polymorphic forms of nirogacestat, including the form that is in clinical development expire in 2039, and a U.S. patent that covers pharmaceutical compositions expires in 2042, in each case, not including patent term adjustment or any regulatory extensions, with foreign counterparts pending. If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of nirogacestat for the treatment of desmoid tumors, we expect to rely on orphan drug exclusivity, which generally grants seven years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. and 10 years of marketing exclusivity in Europe. See “License and collaboration agreements—Pfizer license agreements” above for additional information on our rights under the Nirogacestat License Agreement. Nirogacestat received Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. for the treatment of desmoid tumors and from the European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.
We have exclusive licenses under the Mirdametinib License Agreement to patent rights in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to mirdametinib. The patent rights in-licensed under the Mirdametinib License Agreement include granted patents based on work conducted by us and Pfizer and include four U.S. patents that cover polymorphic forms of mirdametinib, including the form that is currently in clinical development, methods of treatment with the polymorphic forms, and a U.S. patent that covers pharmaceutical compositions expire in 2041, in each case not including any regulatory extensions, with foreign counterparts pending. If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of mirdametinib for the treatment of NF1, we expect to rely on orphan drug exclusivity, which generally grants seven years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. and 10 years of marketing exclusivity in Europe. See “License and collaboration agreements—Pfizer license agreements” above for additional information on our rights under the Mirdametinib License Agreement. The FDA has granted mirdametinib Orphan Drug Designation for NF1-PN, and the European Commission has granted mirdametinib Orphan Drug Designation for NF1.
For combination therapeutics involving nirogacestat or mirdametinib, there may be opportunities to enhance our patent estate, which we will explore. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of these efforts.
Trade secrets
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and partners. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also generally provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
Coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Successful commercialization of new drug products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for those drug products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drug products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford a drug product. Sales of drug products depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of drug products are paid for by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors.
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular drug products. In 
many countries, the prices of drug products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of drug products under such systems are substantially lower than in the U.S. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. Accordingly, in markets outside the U.S., the reimbursement for drug products may be reduced compared with the U.S. In the U.S., the principal decisions about reimbursement for new drug products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new drug product will be covered and reimbursed under certain federal governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. In the U.S., the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. With respect to biologics, third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost sharing obligation imposed on patients. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of a product. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable a manufacturer to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process usually requires manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of their products to each payor separately and is a time-consuming process. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan;
•safe, effective and medically necessary;
•appropriate for the specific patient;
•cost-effective; and
•neither experimental nor investigational.
Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover that product after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a manufacturer to sell its product at a profit.
In addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In the European Union, or EU, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
Government regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products, such as nirogacestat, mirdametinib and our other product candidates. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority and submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
Clinical trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by, or under control of, the trial sponsor, in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
•Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
•Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a larger number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
A registrational trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the drug. Generally, registrational trials are Phase 3 trials but may be Phase 2 trials if the trial design provides a reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a Biologics License Application, or BLA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time, or the FDA may impose other sanctions on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the requirements of the IRB or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. There are also requirements related to registration and reporting of certain clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
U.S.—FDA regulation
Approval process
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications, or NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multi-center trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, which was enacted on December 13, 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating 
and responding to requests for expanded access. This requirement applies on the later of 60 days after the date of enactment or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently $3,242,026 for fiscal year 2023, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program fees for eligible products, which are currently $393,933 for fiscal year 2023.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Exclusivity
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot accept any Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change.
An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
Patent term extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension for one patent. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between IND and NDA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years from approval.
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
Orphan drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug or therapeutic biologic will be recovered from sales in the U.S. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug Designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug Designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan product to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Such a designation, may also be revoked by the FDA in certain circumstances, such as if the agency finds that the applicant’s request for designation request omitted material information required under the Orphan Drug Act and its implementing regulations.
Fast Track Designation and accelerated approval
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment, and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
In addition to other benefits such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing 
compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint and, under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis, and under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to do so. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period.
Breakthrough therapy designation
Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA provides more extensive development consultation opportunities with FDA senior staff, allows for the rolling review of the drug’s application for approval and indicates that the product could be eligible for priority review, if supported by clinical data at the time of application submission for drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Disclosure of clinical trial information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration of the trial on clinicaltrials.gov. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Post-approval requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, and compliance with applicable tracking and tracing requirements. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations which require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs, and those supplying products, ingredients and components of them, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other 
restrictions under a REMS program. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•Fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or withdrawal of product approvals;
•Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and
•Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted by a manufacturer and any third parties acting on behalf of a manufacturer only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the approved label for the product. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
EU regulation
In the EU, our product candidates also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 was adopted, and it came into effect on January 31, 2022, repealing the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all the EU Member States meaning no national implementing legislation in each EU Member State is required. The transitory provisions of the new Clinical Trials Regulation provide that ongoing clinical trials previously authorized under the Directive can remain under the Directive, or they can transition to the Regulation. By January 31, 2025, all ongoing clinical trials must have transitioned to the new Regulation.
The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the EU, we may submit MAAs, either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures.
Centralized procedure
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that is valid in all EU Member States, as well as the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active 
substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products with a new active substance indicted for other diseases, or products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA, is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding clock stops.
National authorization procedures
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
•Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
•Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
Under the above described procedures, before granting a marketing authorization, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU Member States make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
EU regulatory exclusivity
In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
EU orphan designation and exclusivity
The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the EU, are similar in principle to those in the U.S. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (i) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (ii) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (iii) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The ten-year market exclusivity in the EU may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify 
maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product for the same indication as an authorized orphan product at any time if:
•the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior than the authorized orphan product;
•the marketing authorization holder for the authorized orphan product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
•the marketing authorization holder for the authorized orphan product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
EU pediatric investigation plan 
In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or the PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which a marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP (even where such results are negative) are eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension, provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to two years before the SPC expires. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
Post-Approval Controls
The holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.
All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each Member State and can differ from one country to another.
Other regulations – rest of the world
For other countries outside of the EU and the U.S., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Other healthcare laws
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business that may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and transparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and responsible individuals may be subject to imprisonment.
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, including CMS, the HHS Office of Inspector General and HHS Office for Civil Rights, other divisions of the HHS and the Department of Justice.
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the U.S., these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Several biopharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved (e.g., or off-label), and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, if approved, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under these laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations were extended to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year and the reported information is publicly made available on a searchable website.
We may be subject to federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs, as well as federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity, although it is unclear that we would be considered a “business associate” in the normal course of our business. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts. See “European data collection” below for a discussion of data privacy and security enactments of the EU.
For example, California’s Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, went into effect in January 2020, and the California Attorney General has since promulgated final regulations. The law provides broad rights to California consumers with respect to the collection and use of their personal information and imposes data protection obligations on certain businesses. While the CCPA does not apply to protected health information that is subject to HIPAA or personal information collected, used or disclosed in research, as defined by federal law, the CCPA may still affect our business activities. Moreover, on November 3, 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, under a ballot initiative. The CPRA amends the existing CCPA to include new consumer rights and additional data protection obligations. The new data protection requirements under the CPRA apply to information collected on or after January 1, 2022. With the promulgation of final regulations, the California State Attorney General has commenced enforcement actions against CCPA violators. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of CCPA and the amendments under the CPRA exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. The California law further expands the need for privacy and process enhancements and commitment of resources in support of compliance. Moreover, more than ten states have proposed bills in the last year with provisions similar to the CCPA and CPRA. It is likely 
that other states will pass laws similar to the CCPA and the CPRA in the near future and a federal data protection law may also be on the horizon.
Similar state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services. Such laws are generally broad and are enforced by various state agencies and private actions. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, and require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or drug pricing.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, imprisonment, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
European data collection
The collection and use of personal health data in or arising from the EU are governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive and GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, to the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, including in respect of clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Current and future legislation
In the U.S. and other jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products.
Payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or private, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and those methods are not always specifically adapted for new technologies such as gene therapy and therapies addressing rare diseases such as those we are developing. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In particular, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, was enacted, which, among other things, subjected biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, administrative, executive and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an Executive Order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The Executive Order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.
Additionally, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted:
•The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022.
•The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
•On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
•On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
•On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
•On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.
•On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024.
•On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the Inflation Act, into law, which, among other provisions, includes several measures intended to lower the cost of prescription drugs and related healthcare reforms. These proposals, recommendations and enactments include changes to the existing framework in respect of income taxes, as well as new types of non-income taxes (such as taxes based on a percentage of revenue or taxes applicable to digital services).
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. At the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021, CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. Federal Government will pay for healthcare drugs and services, which could result in reduced demand for our drug candidates or additional pricing pressures.
Individual states in the U.S. have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from 
other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 227 full-time employees, of whom, 113 focus on driving forward research and development programs, 36 focus on commercial operations and 78 provide strategic business development, finance and other technical expertise, as well as general and administrative services. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as we continue to develop our products and commercialization capabilities.
We believe our employees are among the most important assets to our company and are key to achieving our goals and expectations. Accordingly, we focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented individuals. Our management teams and function leaders regularly review employee engagement and satisfaction surveys and monitor employee turnover rates.
Compensation and Benefits
We offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people. Our total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses, and equity. We offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through discretionary annual equity grants because we want them to have an ownership stake in the company and to be committed to our long-term success. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and paid time off, including healthcare and wellness benefits, a 401(k) plan, access to legal services, and parental leave.
Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity and inclusion are important parts of our culture. We are focused on understanding our diversity and inclusion strengths and opportunities and executing on a strategy to support further progress. We created a number of employee resource groups to foster dialogue and engagement around dimensions of diversity, such as gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or other shared attributes, which we believe help build community and enable opportunities for development. We continue to focus on building a pipeline for talent to create more opportunities for workplace diversity and to support greater representation within the company.
Corporate history and information
We were originally formed in Delaware in August 2017 and until March 29, 2019, we conducted our business through SpringWorks Therapeutics, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Pursuant to the terms of a corporate reorganization and merger that was completed on March 29, 2019, or the Reorganization, all of the equity interests in SpringWorks Therapeutics, LLC were exchanged for the same number and class of newly issued securities of SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc. and, as a result, SpringWorks Therapeutics, LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc.
On September 17, 2019, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold 10,350,000 shares of our common stock, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,350,000 additional shares of our common stock, at the public offering price of $18.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $169.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Upon the closing of the IPO, our outstanding convertible preferred stock automatically converted into shares of common stock.

COVID-19 pandemic
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2, as a global pandemic. This disease, including emerging variant strains of COVID-19, continues to spread in the areas in which we operate. Governments and businesses around the world have taken unprecedented actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, shelter- in-place orders, quarantines, significant restrictions on travel, as well as restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to work. Starting at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we initiated a number of business continuity measures to mitigate potential disruption to our operations and in order to preserve the integrity of our research and development programs. Our response has evolved over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have largely resumed normal operations. To date, we have not experienced any material disruptions to the execution of the research and development activities that we currently have underway; however, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any impacts of emerging variant strains of the COVID-19 virus, we may experience disruptions that could impact our research and development, and commercialization timelines and outcomes. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, along with the impact of emerging variants, on our business. While the extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacts our future results will depend on future developments, the pandemic and associated impacts, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic (including any resurgences), the impact of emerging variant strains of the COVID-19 virus and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, all of which remain uncertain and difficult to predict, could result in a material impact to our business, prospects, future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
