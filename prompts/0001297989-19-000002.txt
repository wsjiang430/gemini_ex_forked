ITEM 1. Business
ExlService Holdings, Inc. (“EXL”, “we”, “us", "our" or the "Company"), incorporated in Delaware in 2002, is an operations management and analytics company that helps businesses enhance revenue growth and improve profitability. Using proprietary platforms, methodologies, and our full range of digital capabilities, we look deeper to help companies transform their businesses, functions and operations, to help them deliver better customer experience and business outcomes, while managing risk and compliance. We serve our customers in the insurance, healthcare, travel, transportation and logistics, banking and financial services and utilities industries, among others. Headquartered in New York, we have approximately 29,100 professionals in locations throughout the United States, Europe, Asia (primarily India and the Philippines), Latin America, Australia and South Africa.
We operate in the business process management (“BPM”) industry, and we provide operations management and analytics services. Our eight operating segments are strategic business units that align our products and services with how we manage our business, approach our key markets and interact with our clients. Six of those operating segments provide BPM or “operations management” services, which we organize into industry-focused operating segments (Insurance, Healthcare, Travel, Transportation and Logistics, Banking and Financial Services, and Utilities) and one “capability” operating segment (Finance and Accounting) that provides services to clients in our industry-focused segments as well as clients across other industries. In each of these six operating segments we provide operations management services, which typically involve transfer to the Company of business operations of a client, after which we administer and manage those operations for our client on an ongoing basis. Our remaining two operating segments are Consulting, which provides industry-specific digital transformational services related to operations management services, and our Analytics operating segment, which provides services that focus on driving improved business outcomes for clients by generating data-driven insights across all parts of their business. Together, our operations management and analytics services support our customers’ digital transformation agendas, through our differentiated strategy and approach that we call Digital Intelligence. Digital Intelligence combines our capabilities across domain and data to create context that enables us find opportunities for our clients to improve performance, enhance customer experiences and increase profitably. Our digital professionals then orchestrate domain expertise, process excellence and advanced digital technologies in the right mix to deliver significant business outcomes.
 We present information for the following reportable segments: 

• | Insurance,


• | Healthcare,


• | Travel, Transportation and Logistics,


• | Finance and Accounting,


• | Analytics, and


• | All Other (consisting of our remaining operating segments, including our Banking and Financial Services, Utilities and Consulting operating segments).

The July 2018 acquisition of SCIOinspire Holdings, Inc. (“SCIO”) is included in the Analytics reportable segment. The December 2017 acquisition of substantially all of the assets, and assumption of certain liabilities related thereto, of Health Integrated, Inc. (“Health Integrated”) is included in the Healthcare reportable segment.
Operations Management Services
Our operations management services, which we provide from our Insurance, Healthcare, Travel, Transportation and Logistics, Finance and Accounting, Banking and Financial Services, Utilities and Consulting operating segments, typically involve the transfer to EXL business operations of a client such as claims processing, clinical operations, or financial transaction processing, after which we administer and manage those operations for our client on an ongoing basis, or in case of consulting, consulting services related to transformation services, including digital transformation services. We use a focused industry vertical approach to manage our business and to provide a suite of integrated BPM services to organizations in the insurance, healthcare, travel transportation and logistics, banking and financial services and utilities industries in addition to providing finance and accounting and consulting services across these industries as well as to clients in other industries like manufacturing and media among others. 
The key differentiators and salient features of our BPM services include our agile operating and delivery model utilizing domain and data expertise and process excellence, the Digital EXLerator FrameworkTM, our ability to deploy a Business Process-as-a-Service (“BPaaS”) delivery model, business process automation (including robotics), consulting-driven digital transformation and our industry vertical focused approach. The Digital EXLerator FrameworkTM, is our integrated approach

to operations management which enables us to drive better customer outcomes by using advanced automation (such as robotics, advanced analytics and artificial intelligence), process optimization (lean six-sigma), along with smart workflow, driving better orchestration of human talent and technology. 
While the majority of our operations management services are provided to clients using client-owned or licensed technology platforms, we also deliver our services across clients and industries using a BPaaS delivery model. The BPaaS delivery model includes the provision of a technology platform along with process management services. The service offering typically requires lower capital outlay, is faster to implement and is priced based on the number of transactions or usage by the client. These services may use standardized and shared technology and operational delivery infrastructure enabling us to leverage technology and infrastructure investments across multiple clients.

Business Strategy
We are a business process management company providing operations management and analytics services that help businesses enhance revenue growth and enhance profitability. Specific elements of our strategy include:
Deploying our Digital EXLerator FrameworkTM in Operations Management 
In servicing our operations management clients, we differentiate ourselves by using our proprietary Digital EXLerator FrameworkTM, described above. Digital EXLeratorTM has helped EXL win new clients as well as increase satisfaction with existing clients. Advanced automation is another key element where we leverage proprietary and partner technologies to drive operational efficiencies and provide a step-change in the degrees of automation (such as robotics) embedded within the process. 
Developing Business Process-as-a-Service (“BPaaS”) Solutions to distinguish our BPM Solutions
We continue to invest and focus in developing BPaaS and technology-enabled product solutions, including updated and enhanced LifePRO®, Auditstream and Express Survey products. We are shifting part of our servicing model in niche operations management services from our current model to a BPaaS servicing model that offers an integrated technology platform with operations management services. BPaaS services are typically delivered using a transaction-based or outcome-based pricing model and can minimize a client’s initial capital investment on technology. In addition to existing solutions, we intend to enter into additional partnerships to develop and take-to-market new BPaaS solutions. 
Building Industry Solutions
Our focus is to develop industry solutions that will help solve a particular industry problem leveraging our existing operations management capabilities, domain expertise, advanced digital technologies and analytics capabilities. We are building proprietary solutions internally and are also co-creating new solutions with our industry partners and clients. In 2018, we announced two such solutions: (1) a Digital Know Your Customer solution in collaboration with HSBC Holdings, PLC that delivers cost efficiencies for banks and large financial services firms and (2) a Current Expected Credit Loss solution with TransUnion to help banks, saving associations and credit unions to comply with the new regulations of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Further, in December 2017 we acquired preferred stock in Corridor Platforms Inc., a company in the process of launching a big data credit risk management solution to support real-time credit decisions throughout the customer lifecycle.
Building Additional Analytics Capabilities and Solution Offerings 
We continue to invest in our Analytics capabilities by expanding our digital solution offerings, enhancing the skill sets and training of our team, and developing reusable intellectual property that can be incorporated into our analytics services. We intend to further increase our investment in our proprietary methodologies and algorithms that help us improve our ability to predict outcomes for our clients to help them capture data signals in a more efficient manner. In order to optimize the way in which we deliver analytics services to clients and source the highest quality global talent, we intend to continue expanding our multi-shore delivery capabilities by adding to our team of professionals in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe, India, the Philippines, South Africa and Colombia. In addition to hiring directly from educational institutions, we actively look to hire additional experienced senior team members in order to deepen our industry expertise and thought leadership.

Extending Our Industry Expertise
We intend to further extend our knowledge and capabilities in the industry verticals we serve in order to enhance our reputation as a provider of business process services. By focusing on transitioning, managing and digitizing more complex and value-enhancing services, we augment our capability to serve our clients, including helping our clients evolve their digital transformation efforts. In order to market our base of experience externally, we intend to continue to produce additional primary research and technical papers in order to enhance our reputation as industry thought leaders.
Recruiting, Training, and Retaining the Most Talented Professionals
We have instituted an integrated talent management framework through active collaboration between our recruitment, capability development and business human resource functions. We deploy innovative methods to recruit, train and retain our skilled employees. We intend to focus on recruiting the right talent and develop them further on relevant competencies through our learning academies, rigorous promotion standards, client and industry specific training and competitive compensation packages that include incentive-based compensation. We are able to leverage shared resources across our services, particularly those in operations management, including as a result of our personnel having skillsets applicable to a wide variety of BPM services. We supplement our scope of operations experience with several industry-specific domain academies to enhance the specialization quotient of our employees.
Cultivating Long-term Relationships and Expanding our Client Base
We continue to maintain our focus on cultivating long-term client relationships as well as attracting new clients. We believe there are significant opportunities for additional growth within our existing clients, and we seek to expand these relationships by:

• | Increasing the depth and breadth of the services we provide across new client business, functions and geographies;


• | Offering the full suite of EXL services that includes operations management (including consulting; digital transformation) and analytics; and


• | Supporting our clients’ geographic expansion leveraging our global footprint.

We intend to continue building a portfolio of Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies in our focus industries that have the most complex and diverse processes and, accordingly, stand to benefit significantly from our services. We also intend to cultivate long-term relationships with medium-sized companies in our focus industries leveraging our BPaaS and technology offerings.
Expanding our Global Delivery Footprint and Operational Infrastructure
We intend to further expand and invest in our network of delivery centers to service our clients. In 2018, we expanded our operations centers in India and in the United States, including an operating facility in Connecticut in the United States and Chennai in India as a result of our acquisition of SCIO. In 2017, our acquisition of the Health Integrated business added an operating facility in Tampa, Florida.
Pursuing Strategic Relationships and Acquisitions
We intend to continue making selective acquisitions in our focus industry verticals as well as to add to our capabilities. We consider selective strategic relationships with industry leaders that add new long-term client relationships, enhance the depth and breadth of our services and complement our business strategy. We also pursue select partnerships, alliances or investments that will expand the scope and effectiveness of our services by adding proprietary technology assets and intellectual property, adding new clients or allowing us to enter new geographic markets. In 2018, we launched our Connected Intelligence Partnership programs to expand our technology and innovation ecosystem to accelerate client business outcomes from digital transformation. The Connected Intelligence program has enhanced go-to-market opportunities with new programs for emerging innovators and startups, digital technology partners, industry solution partners and alliances and associations to deliver leading digital solutions and services to its clients.

Our Industry
Operations Management
BPM service providers work with clients to transfer their key business processes to reduce costs, improve process quality, handle increased transaction volumes and reduce redundancy. BPM providers can enable organizations to enhance profitability and increase efficiency and reliability, permitting them to concentrate on their core areas of competence. BPM is a long-term strategic commitment for a company that, once implemented, is generally not subject to cyclical spending or information technology budget fluctuations. Increased global demand, cost improvements in international communications and the automation of many business services have created a significant opportunity for BPM providers with offshore delivery capabilities, and many companies are moving select office processes to providers with the capacity to perform these functions from overseas locations. We believe the demand for BPM services will be primarily led by industries that are transaction-driven and that require significant customer interactions. 
According to India’s National Association of Software and Service Companies, an industry trade organization, exports from India in the information technology and BPM industry are expected to grow 7%-9% year over year in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.
Analytics
Companies are increasingly looking to BPM service providers to provide a suite of analytics services, including statistical tools, models and techniques to clean, organize and examine structured and unstructured corporate data. This data is then used by companies to generate specific business-related analysis and insights into their business and prospects. The enhanced generation of business data across multiple formats, substantial reduction in data storage costs, growing enterprise demand for data-driven and real-time decision making and availability of sophisticated analytics tools have enabled companies to overcome a local shortage of specialized analytics talent and benefit from global labor markets. BPM service providers who can develop industry-specific analytics expertise are especially well poised to benefit from this global trend.
Sales, Marketing and Client Management
We market our services to our existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams, which are aligned by industry verticals and cross-industry domains such as finance and accounting and consulting. Our sales and client management teams operate from the U.S., Europe, Australia and South Africa are supported by our business development teams. 
Our sales, marketing and business development teams are responsible for new client acquisitions, public relations, relations with outsourcing advisory companies, analyst relations and rankings, lead generation, knowledge management, content development, campaign management, digital or web presence, brand awareness and participation in industry forums and conferences. As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 150 sales, marketing, business development and client management professionals with the majority of them based in either the U.S. or Europe. Our professionals generally have significant experience in business process services, technology, operations, analytics and consulting.
Clients
EXL generated revenues from approximately 480 clients and 420 clients in 2018 and 2017, respectively (with annual revenue exceeding $50,000 per client). We have won 50 and 42 new clients during 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Our top three, five and ten clients generated 16.4%, 23.7% and 37.2% of our revenues, respectively, in 2018. Our top three, five and ten clients generated 17.1%, 24.6% and 38.6% of our revenues, respectively, in 2017. No client accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in 2018 or 2017. Our revenue concentration with our top clients remains consistent year-over-year and we continue to develop relationships with new clients to diversify our client base. We believe that the loss of any of our ten largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients.” 
Our long-term relationships with our clients typically evolve from providing a single, discrete service or process into providing a series of complex, integrated processes across multiple business lines. For operations management services other than consulting, we enter into long-term agreements with our clients with typical initial terms of between three to five years. Consulting engagements have typical terms of six to twelve months. Agreements for Analytics services are either project based or having shorter initial terms, which are typically between one to three years. However, each agreement is individually negotiated with the client.
Competition
Competition in the BPM services industry is intense and growing. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We face significant competition from U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based BPM and information technology (“IT”) 
6

companies and from our clients, who may build shared services centers to perform these services themselves, either in-house, in the U.S. or through offshore groups or other arrangements.” Many companies, including certain of our clients, choose to perform some or all of their customer-facing and back-office processes internally, utilizing their own employees to provide these services as part of their regular business operations. Some companies have moved portions of their in-house customer management functions offshore, including to offshore affiliates. We believe our key advantage over in-house business processes management is that we provide companies the opportunity to focus on their core products and markets while we focus on service delivery and operational excellence. We compete primarily against:

• | BPM service companies with delivery capability in offshore locations, particularly India, such as Genpact Limited and WNS (Holdings) Limited;


• | BPM divisions of large global IT service companies, such as Accenture, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services;


• | Niche providers that provide services in a specific geographic market, industry or service area such as analytics or healthcare; and


• | Leading accounting and management consulting firms.

We compete against these entities by working to establish ourselves as a service provider with deep industry expertise, strong client relationships, leading industry talent, superior operational and process capabilities, differentiated technology and BPaaS solutions, and sophisticated analytic and consulting capabilities, which enable us to respond rapidly to market trends and the evolving needs of our clients.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property consists of proprietary and licensed platforms, software and databases, trade secrets, methodologies and know-how, trademarks, copyrighted software, operating procedures and other materials and patents and pending patent applications. We have several registered trademarks and logos, three issued patents and several pending patent and trademark applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and certain foreign jurisdictions. We consider many of our business processes and implementation methodologies to be trade secrets or proprietary know-how and confidential information. To provide our services, in addition to our own proprietary tools, we use software and data licensed by us or our clients from third parties. We also use SaaS services from third parties pursuant to contracts with us or our clients. In particular, we have developed several strategic partnerships with robotics and process automation software companies to facilitate our offering of automation to our clients.
Clients and business partners sign nondisclosure agreements requiring confidential treatment of our information. Our employees are required to sign work-for-hire and confidentiality covenants as a condition to their employment. 
Our technology group and various business lines develop proprietary tools that we deploy to support services for our clients. We typically retain ownership of any pre-existing tools. While working on client engagements, we also often develop new tools or methodologies, including robotics and process automation software or “bots,” and we endeavor to negotiate contracts that give us ownership or licenses to use or demonstrate such tools for other clients.
Information Security and Data Privacy
We have a strong focus on information security, cyber security, data privacy and the protection of our clients’ and their customers’ confidential personal and sensitive information. We have made significant investments to strengthen our information security and cyber security posture and protocols to ensure compliance with our contractual obligations and the laws and regulations governing our activities. These investments include people, processes and technology intended to protect information throughout its life cycle. 
EXL places significant focus on implementing and maintaining cyber security capabilities to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from cyber threats, incidents and attacks; reduce vulnerabilities and minimize the impact of cyber incidents. We have a culture of compliance and institutional governance built upon and supported by policies and processes, tools and technologies, and regular knowledge and awareness training. EXL takes into account guidance from the Cyber Security Framework of the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the U.S. Department of Commerce in designing controls and policies regarding security for client and business data. EXL has undertaken measures designed to comply with new European privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) and/or any corresponding or equivalent national laws or regulations. 
According to the needs of our clients as well as the regulatory requirements of the geographies in which we operate, many of our delivery centers are certified in regard to quality, information security and employee safety, such as the ISO 9001:2008 standard for quality management system, the ISO 27001:2013 standard for our information security management system and the OHSAS 18001:2007 standard for our occupational health and safety management system. Some of our centers in the Philippines and South Africa and certain client processes in other operation centers in India are compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) version 3.2 or higher requirements. We engage independent firms 
7

to conduct General Controls and business process specific SSAE 16 (SOC I - Type II) assessments EXL offers managed hosting environments for our BPaaS solutions in our Insurance and Healthcare verticals. The technology applications designed to meet disaster recover requirements are hosted in ISO 27001 certified, SSAE18 SOC1 Compliant Tier 4 data centers that are proactively monitored and managed 24 hours a day to meet the client’s business requirements. 
We have a robust, wide area network and international telecommunications capacity to support our global business operations. Our infrastructure is built to industry standards, leveraging leading technology providers and partners. Our business continuity management includes plans to mitigate and manage operational risks by building resilience and redundancy in our telecommunications and network infrastructure, applications and IT infrastructure, utilities and power, and trained talent across our service delivery locations.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had a headcount of approximately 29,100 employees, with approximately 20,200 employees based in India and approximately 5,100 employees in the Philippines. We have approximately 2,700 employees in the U.S, 200 employees in the U.K., 200 employees in Colombia, and 400 employees in the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, and 300 in South Africa and other geographies. None of our employees are unionized. We have never experienced any work stoppages and believe that we enjoy good employee relations.
Hiring and Recruiting
Our employees are critical to the success of our business. Accordingly, we focus on recruiting, training and retaining our professionals. We have developed effective strategies that enable an efficient recruitment process. We have over 110 employees dedicated to recruitment. Some of the strategies we have adopted to increase efficiency in our hiring practices include the utilization of online voice assessments and a centralized hiring center. Our hiring policies focus on identifying high quality employees who demonstrate a propensity for learning, contribution to client services and growth. Candidates must undergo numerous tests and interviews before we extend offers for employment. We also conduct background checks on candidates, including criminal background checks, where permitted and as required by clients or on a sample basis. In addition, where permitted and required for client services, we perform random drug testing on the workforce on a regular basis.
We offer our employees competitive compensation packages that include incentive-based compensation and offer a variety of benefits that vary by facility, including free transport to and from home in certain circumstances, subsidized meals and free access to recreational facilities that are located within some of our operations centers. Our attrition rate for employees who had been with EXL for more than 180 days was 31.8% and 32.0% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As competition in our industry increases, our turnover rate could increase. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We may fail to attract and retain enough sufficiently trained employees to support our operations, as competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and we experience significant employee turnover rates.”
Capability Development and Training
We maintain a strong focus on capability development, with an emphasis on digital transformation deeper knowledge, specialization and domain expertise. Our talent and learning strategies are aligned to the overall business strategy. This creates thought leaders with high industry acumen who are better able to address our clients’ requirements. We also provide a career -linked learning path to our employees from new hires to tenured employees to senior levels of leadership.
Our domain academies focus on building domain expertise through certifications and specialization. These include our Insurance Academy, Travel Academy, Finance and Accounting Academy, Healthcare Academy, Analytics Academy, Consulting Academy and Digital Academy.  These domain academies focus on achieving excellence and developing skill sets that can be used across the different domains. Our training includes behavioral and functional components to enhance and ensure job readiness as well as also boosting ongoing productivity and effectiveness. We also focus on promoting better diversity and inclusion through our training programs. We have a global presence catering to the specific learning requirements of each geography. We provide learning through our blended learning methodology comprising of classroom, on the job coaching and technology led learning.
Regulation
Our operations sometimes are subject to rules, regulations and statutes in the countries where we have operations and where we deliver services as a result of the diverse and complex nature of our service offerings. More often, however, our clients contractually require that we comply with certain rules and regulations applicable to their specific industries.
We are one of the few service providers that can provide third-party administrator insurance services from India and the Philippines and are currently able to provide such services in the U.S. for 49 states and 23 states (including the District 
8

of Columbia), respectively. Additionally, our Philippines subsidiary is able to provide utilization review services in the U.S. for 39 states (including the District of Columbia). Further, through domestic subsidiaries, we are licensed or otherwise eligible to provide third-party administrator services in all states within the U.S. as well as utilization review, insurance adjuster, and insurance producer services in select states. We are required to maintain licenses in various jurisdictions or require certain categories of our professionals to be individually licensed in service areas such as debt collection, utilization review, workers’ compensation utilization review, insurance adjuster, insurance producer and telemarketing services. Our facilities in the Philippines are accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), a leading healthcare and education accreditation organization, while one domestic subsidiary is accredited by both NCQA and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission. We continue to obtain licenses and accreditations required from time to time by our business operations.
Our operations are also subject to compliance with a variety of other laws, including U.S. federal and state regulations that apply to certain portions of our business such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information Technology for Economics and Clinical Health Act of 2009, GDPR and the UK Bribery Act. We must also comply with applicable regulations relating to health and other personal information that we handle as part of our services.
We benefit from tax relief provided by laws and regulations in India and the Philippines from time to time. Regulation of our business by the Indian government affects us in several ways. During the last several years, we either established or acquired new centers that are eligible for tax benefits under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005 (the “SEZ Act”). The SEZ Act introduced a 15-year tax holiday scheme for operations established in designated special economic zones (“SEZs”). Under the SEZ Act, qualifying operations are eligible for a deduction from taxable income equal to (i) 100% of their export profits derived for the first five years from the commencement of operations; (ii) 50% of such export profits for the next five years; and (iii) 50% of the export profits for a further five years, subject to satisfying certain capital investment requirements. The SEZ Act provides, among other restrictions, that this holiday is not available to operations formed by splitting up or reconstructing existing operations or transferring existing plant and equipment (beyond a prescribed limit) to new SEZ locations. We anticipate establishing additional operations centers in SEZs or other tax advantaged locations in the future. See “Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risks related to the International nature of our business - Our financial condition could be negatively affected if foreign governments introduce new legislation, reduce or withdraw tax benefits and other incentives currently provided to companies within our industry or if we are not eligible for these benefits.” 
We also benefitted from a corporate tax holiday in the Philippines for some of our operations centers established there over the last several years. The Company registered with the Philippines Economic Zone Authority (“PEZA”) and is inter-alia, eligible for income tax exemption for four years. This exemption incentive may be extended in certain instances upon fulfillment of certain conditions. Following the expiry of the tax exemption, income generated from centers in the Philippines will be taxed at the prevailing annual tax rate.
