ITEM 1. Business
Overview
 Our business is transforming healthcare by empowering the primary care physicians ("PCPs") to be the agents for change in the communities they serve. We believe that PCPs, with their intimate patient-physician relationships, are best positioned to drive meaningful change in quality, cost and patient experience when provided with the right infrastructure and payment model. Through our combination of the agilon platform, a long-term partnership model with existing physician groups and a growing network of like-minded physicians, we are poised to revolutionize healthcare for seniors across communities throughout the United States. Our purpose-built model provides the necessary capabilities, capital and business model for existing physician groups to create a Medicare-centric, globally capitated line of business. Our model operates by primarily forming RBEs within local geographies, that enter into arrangements with payors providing for monthly payments to manage the total healthcare needs of our physician partners’ attributed patients (or global capitation arrangements). The RBEs also contract with agilon to perform certain functions and enter into long-term professional service agreements with one or more anchor physician groups pursuant to which the anchor physician groups receive a base compensation rate and share in the savings from successfully improving quality of care and reducing costs.
 Our company was formed in 2016, and we established our inaugural partnership with an anchor physician group in 2017. Our ability to rapidly build scaled positions in local communities has allowed us to grow to 23 anchor physician groups and 25 geographies in five years. Our platform has enabled us to grow our total membership by 45% and revenue by 48% from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the PCPs on our platform serve approximately 269,500 MA members and 89,000 Medicare fee-for-service (“FFS”) beneficiaries through eight direct contracting entities (“DCEs”) through our participation in the CMS Innovation Center Direct Contracting Model, which our PCPs serve. The Direct Contracting Model was redesigned and renamed the Accountable Care Organization Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health (“ACO REACH”) Model beginning in 2023.
 For a description of our significant activities during 2022, see “Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—2022 Results” in this Report.
 Our business model is differentiated by its focus on existing community-based physician groups and is built around three key elements: (1) agilon’s platform; (2) agilon’s long-term physician partnership approach; and (3) agilon’s network. With our model, our goal is to remove the barriers that prevent community-based physicians from evolving to a Total Care Model, where the physician is empowered to manage health outcomes and the total healthcare needs of their attributed Medicare patients.
The agilon Platform: The agilon platform is holistic in supporting the rapid transition to a Total Care Model with technology, people, process and capital. Our purpose-built platform comprises an integrated set of capabilities designed to continuously improve. Our platform is delivered to our anchor physician groups through a long-term partnership model to support the adoption and success of a Medicare-centric, globally capitated line of business.
agilon’s Long-term Physician Partner Model: We built the agilon platform to be deployed through an aligned long-term partnership model with community-based physician groups to move healthcare closer to the physician, be outcome-centric and optimize the long-term sticky relationship between a patient and their existing physician. Through this partnership, our physician partners’ existing MA patient panels are attributed to our platform through our subscription-like per-member per-month ("PMPM") agreements with payors. The combination of these subscription-like agreements, the sticky patient-physician relationship and our long-term partnership model, which is typically 20 years in duration, results in a growing and recurring revenue stream and provides significant visibility into the near-term and long-term financial trajectory for both agilon and our anchor physician groups. In January of each year, we typically have visibility into greater than 90% of that year’s projected revenue. As earnings are generated at the local level due to improvements in quality of care and management of healthcare costs, we share those earnings with our anchor physician groups.
agilon’s Network: Enhancing the power and growth of the agilon platform is the rapidly expanding group of leading community-based physician partners, functioning as a collaborative group through the agilon network. We believe the power of this network is demonstrated by our ability to add new physician partners and to attract additional PCPs to our physician partners. The ability to share best practices, influence the development of the platform, compare notes on the transition to a Total Care Model and learn from one another represents a valuable opportunity for physicians. We believe the power of a like-minded group of community-based physicians, many of whom are leaders in their community, will enhance innovation, growth, quality of care and patient experience, and ultimately strengthen the power of the independent physician business model in local communities across the country.

 These risks are discussed in more detail in Item 1A below.
 Reimbursement Model and Organization
 Under a traditional FFS reimbursement model, physicians are paid a fixed amount for services provided during a patient visit, regardless of a patient’s medical need or health outcome. As a result, physician reimbursement is solely related to the volume of patient visits and procedures performed, thereby offering limited financial incentive to focus on preventative care and cost containment. Value-based care models offer alternative reimbursement models, which typically incentivize physicians for improving the cost and quality of healthcare provided for an attributed patient population. Various types of value-based care reimbursement models exist, including capitation, bundled payments, or payments for attainment of improved quality metrics or medical cost efficiency.
Under our Total Care Model, which is a type of value-based care reimbursement model, we are responsible for managing the medical costs associated with our attributed members. This structure empowers physicians to focus on the improvement of the quality of care provided, and to share in the financial surplus created to the extent premiums received exceed the cost of medical care. Under such a structure, physicians are incentivized to improve the quality and efficiency of care as well as health outcomes for their patients.
Physician and Payor Contractual Relationships
Physicians
Our business model combines the agilon platform, a network of like-minded physicians and a long-term partnership model in order to provide physician groups with the necessary capabilities, capital and business model to create a Medicare-centric, globally capitated line of business. We believe that failing to empower PCPs to drive meaningful change in quality, cost and patient experience has historically fostered waste, unnecessary variability in care and poor patient experience and health outcomes. We seek to partner with leading community-based physician groups under a Total Care Model. We have formed long-term partnerships with diverse leading community-based physician groups in geographies such as Ohio, Connecticut, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas. By providing technology, people, process and capital, we aim to improve the quality and cost of healthcare and drive long-term growth while creating a sustainable business model for our physician partners.
Under the Total Care Model, we typically operate by forming RBEs within local geographies. These wholly-owned RBEs enter into risk-bearing, global capitation agreements with payors, contract with agilon to perform certain functions and enter into long-term professional service agreements with one or more partner primary care or multi-specialty physician groups. We refer to these groups as our “anchor physician groups.” Individual MA members whose care is provided by PCPs employed or affiliated with our anchor physician groups are attributed to the RBE, which bears financial responsibility for the associated medical costs of such members. We have entered into long-term professional services agreements with our anchor physician groups, which typically have a contractual duration of 20 years. In accordance with relevant accounting guidance, each of these RBEs is determined to be a variable interest entity consolidated by agilon, as we have: (i) the ability, through the management services and governance arrangements, to direct the activities (excluding clinical decisions) that most significantly affect the RBE’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the RBE.
Through incentive compensation arrangements, we share a portion of the RBE’s savings from successfully improving the quality of care and reducing costs with our anchor physician groups. Typically, our anchor physician groups receive a FFS base compensation rate for services rendered which is paid directly by health plan payors to our anchor physician groups or, in certain arrangements, paid from the health plan payor to the applicable RBE, who pays the compensation received to our anchor physician groups. In certain cases, our anchor physician groups may be entitled to a guaranteed minimum FFS base compensation rate from the RBE in the event that the FFS base compensation rate paid by the health plan payor does not meet the negotiated base compensation rate as agreed between the RBE and the anchor physician group, or if the FFS base compensation rate paid by the health plan payor falls below what the anchor physician group had received prior to joining our platform. Historically, the base compensation rates paid directly by the health plan payors to our anchor physician groups have met or exceeded applicable guaranteed minimum FFS base compensation rates. This base compensation is initially negotiated with the RBE for the first ten years of each agreement, subject to annual increases based on current market rates and other agreed upon adjustment factors, after which it is subject to renegotiation. Although our RBEs are wholly-owned subsidiaries of agilon, our anchor physician groups participate in each RBE’s governance, with individuals designated or nominated by the applicable anchor physician groups having representation on each RBE’s board of directors. Most of our contracts with our anchor physician groups contain exclusivity or other provisions intended to promote interconnectedness with our physician partners for applicable lines of business in order to facilitate the longevity and stability of the partnership. Typically, these contracts provide for termination rights that are triggered upon certain events, subject to applicable cure periods, including bankruptcy or insolvency events, exclusion, suspension or debarment from state or federal government programs and the occurrence of government action that can be reasonably expected to negatively influence our business. We have historically issued certain stock-based instruments, which we refer to as “partner physician group equity agreements,” to our anchor physician groups pursuant to which they are entitled to receive equity of their local RBE or agilon health, respectively, in the future only upon the occurrence of certain events deemed a “change of control” of the RBE, or a “change of control” of agilon health, if such event occurs before a “change of control” of the RBE. Upon our initial public offering, a “change of control” event occurred for the agilon health related instruments and the respective physician groups received equity. For additional discussion related the agilon health related instruments, see “Critical Accounting Estimates – Stock-Based Compensation.”
 In addition, in Hawaii we operate under a risk-bearing independent practice association model through which we have broadly contracted with physicians across the state and have developed select deeper primary care relationships within the network. PCPs in our Hawaii network are typically compensated on a FFS basis based on applicable Medicare fee schedules.
In addition to our contractual arrangements with our physician partners, we also maintain relationships with other providers who care for our members, including hospitals, specialists and ancillary providers. Such providers typically contract directly with payors. We and our physician partners maintain effective working relationships with the majority of the higher-volume providers in our geographies in order to retain insight into the provision of care to our members and ensure care is rendered effectively and in a manner which supports the achievement of appropriate clinical outcomes.
Health Plan Payors
We enter into contractual agreements with health plan payors in each of our geographies, under which we are financially responsible for our physician partners’ provision of a defined spectrum of healthcare services to our members, in exchange for a defined PMPM fee for each of our members (which is also referred to as “global capitation”). The healthcare services for which we are responsible under such arrangements generally include all healthcare costs which CMS considers as Part A and B costs, including hospitalization and facility costs, primary and specialty care provider costs, and ancillary services costs. In certain of our payor arrangements, we are also financially responsible for Part D pharmaceutical costs for prescriptions rendered to our members. Through these payor agreements, we help to create access for our physician partners to value-based care reimbursement structures through our Total Care Model, which allow our physician partners to focus on the improvement of the quality of care provided to their patients, and to share in the financial surplus created to the extent premiums received exceed the cost of medical care.
The global capitation fees we are entitled to receive from our health plan payor contracts are typically based on a defined percentage of the corresponding monthly premium payments which the payor receives from CMS for members attributed to our PCPs and covered under such contracts. The premium payments to payors are based on county-level benchmark rates established by CMS and payors’ annual bid of amounts necessary to cover the cost of a standard MA patient, and are influenced by several factors, including, but not limited to, the applicable MA plan’s STAR rating and CMS’ risk-adjustment model, which compensates payors based on the health status (acuity) of each individual patient in the preceding calendar year. For agreements where we are delegated for claims payment, we utilize amounts received under the applicable agreement on a monthly basis to pay such claims for medical services rendered to our members. For agreements where the payor retains responsibility for paying claims on our behalf, as is the case today in the majority of our payor agreements, funding under the applicable agreement is utilized by the payor to pay such claims, and we receive surplus distributions on a monthly or quarterly basis. In these arrangements, the payor maintains the responsibility for entering into contractual agreements with network hospitals, network specialty physicians, and ancillary or other providers. Additionally, certain of our contracts with payors incorporate provisions in which we are eligible to earn additional payments on top of our capitation payments based upon the attainment of defined quality performance criteria correlated to applicable STAR ratings criteria. Premiums received may be subject to future adjustment.
 We have developed local contracts across multiple payors, along with national form contracts with certain key payors, which provide a consistency of non-financial contract terms, data sharing, operational processes and governance structures and support portability of the agilon platform. We typically maintain various contracts with a single national payor in order to reflect varying economic terms across our geographies, and to provide for distinct subsidiary entities of our company and a national payor as parties to these contracts. As of January 1, 2023, we have relationships with 23 health plan payors across 25 geographies. Payors with which we contract include large national health plans as well as smaller local and regional insurers. We believe our ability to offer multiple MA plans and products to our physician partners in each geography creates significant value for our physician partners and the members that they serve. Members are able to select the plan and benefit design that meets their individual needs while our platform enables a seamless experience regardless of plan or product for all patients and physician groups.
The agreements with our payors outline the range of healthcare services for which we are financially responsible and at risk, the services for which we are contracted to perform on the payor’s behalf and the key financial terms. Our contracts with payors generally have terms of one to three years and are typically renewed for one-year periods unless terminated in accordance with the terms of such agreements. When we enter into a new payor contract, we are typically required by the payor to contribute risk-bearing capital to the local operating subsidiary. This typically takes the form of letters of credit or restricted deposits, or the payor may retain a percentage of the capitation payments due under the applicable contract. Risk-bearing capital required by payors varies by payor and geography, but typically averages between 1.0-3.0% of projected annual gross revenue attributable to the corresponding agreement.
Our payor agreements also typically incorporate various termination rights, which are negotiated based on the scope of the market-facing solutions that the payor has adopted and the duration of the contract. Most of our contracts include cure periods during which time we may attempt to resolve any issues that would trigger a payor’s ability to terminate the contract. However, certain of our contracts are also terminable immediately upon the occurrence of certain events. For example, some of our contracts may be terminated immediately by the payor if we lose applicable licenses, go bankrupt, lose our liability insurance or receive an exclusion, suspension or debarment from state or federal government authorities.
The contracts with our payors impose other obligations on us. For example, we typically agree that all services provided under our contract and all employees providing such services will comply with such payor’s policies and procedures. We also typically agree to indemnify our payors against certain third-party claims.
Direct Contracting Model (ACO REACH beginning 2023)
During 2021 and 2022, agilon, in conjunction with some of our physician partners, participated in the Direct Contracting Model (referred to as the Global and Professional Direct Contracting (“GPDC”) Model) in certain geographies, through eight approved DCEs. The Direct Contracting Model was a voluntary payment model option aimed at reducing expenditures and preserving or enhancing quality of care for beneficiaries in traditional Medicare FFS established by the CMS Innovation Center.
Under the Direct Contracting Model, CMS contracted directly with each of the DCEs pursuant to participation agreements, in which such DCE selects risk-sharing and fee payment options. The participation agreements included various terms and conditions each DCE must comply with, including meeting certain operational requirements. Each of the DCEs selected the Global risk-sharing option, in which the DCE assumed accountability for the total cost of care of the FFS beneficiaries aligned to such DCEs. In addition, each of our DCEs had selected the Primary Care Capitation Payment (the “PCC”) option. The participation agreements between our DCEs and CMS expire two years after the “Model Performance Period” established by CMS, which lasts from April 1, 2021 through December 31, 2026. The DCE may terminate its participation agreement with CMS at any time upon advance written notice. CMS has certain additional termination rights, including in connection with the termination of the Direct Contracting Model or non-compliance of the DCE. Additionally, CMS has the right to amend a participation agreement without the consent of the DCE for good cause, or as necessary to comply with applicable federal or state law, regulatory requirements, accreditation standards or licensing guidelines or rules.
In addition, the DCEs operate in partnership pursuant to participating medical group agreements with one or more of our physician partners in certain geographies. Our contracted physician partners provide Medicare services to their aligned beneficiaries, and bill CMS on a FFS basis for such services. In turn, in accordance with the PCC option, CMS compensates each physician partner for a portion of their billed services based on the applicable rate, and the remaining portion is paid to each DCE on a per Medicare beneficiary per month (“PBPM”) basis based on a prospective estimate of such remaining portion of billed services. By 2025, CMS will no longer pay any portion to such physician partner based on FFS compensation rates, and will transition to compensating physician partners through their applicable DCE on a PBPM basis. Each DCE then remits payment out of the PBPM payments from CMS to its contracted physician partners on a monthly or quarterly basis pursuant to the applicable participating medical group agreement, which agreement also includes incentive compensation tied to the DCE’s net profits received for aligned beneficiaries. In addition, certain participating medical group agreements also allow the relevant physician partner to choose an adjustment to the applicable incentive compensation to receive a portion of such compensation in equity of agilon. Our DCEs’ participating medical group agreements provide for mutual indemnification rights, and have an initial term through December 31, 2026, unless earlier terminated.
 The ACO REACH model, which formally launched on January 1, 2023, is largely the same as its predecessor model, GPDC, with the following minor differences: (i) all ACOs are required to develop and implement a robust health equity plan to identify and better serve underserved communities; (ii) 75% control of each ACO's governing body must be held by participating providers or their designated representatives (compared to 25% during the first two performance years of the GPDC model); and (iii) each ACO must have at least two beneficiary representatives on its governing board (at least one Medicare beneficiary and at least one consumer advocate), both of whom must hold voting rights. agilon has implemented these changes for the 2023 performance year with minimal disruption. In addition, the CMS Innovation Center announced that ACO REACH would include technical adjustments to the model’s parameters, including changes to benchmark calculations. The overall effect of these changes on our ACO’s benchmarks has been minimal.

Marketing and Distribution
 In accordance with Medicare marketing guidelines, health plan payors are responsible for marketing directly to patients. Our focus is on outreach to existing community-based physician groups to join our platform, establishing and maintaining our local branding and strategies to support education for our Medicare-eligible members in evaluating their Medicare options.
Through our long-term partnership model, we partner with leading community-based physician groups in our existing geographies and aim to expand our geographic reach by partnering with community-based physician groups in new geographies, across the United States. Our growth strategy is supported by a dedicated business development team that works closely with physician groups, senior management and key stakeholders to identify potential physician groups to partner with and integrate onto our platform and into our network. Additionally, we believe our network of like-minded physician partners also attracts new physicians to join, as access to cross-market know-how and best practices encourages success in a Total Care Model.
Our enterprise marketing team develops branding strategies and identities in our geographies and supports the development of communication and branding materials to support the local growth of our physician partners and their Medicare patient population. This begins with our entry into a new geography. We create a local brand that embodies the value of the Total Care Model for patients as well as the history and culture of our physician partner. Each geography has its own customized brand, which includes “Senior Care Advantage” as part of the naming convention to help reinforce the value of our national network to payors, policy makers and other industry constituents. To empower patients to make informed decisions about their coverage options, educational opportunities and materials are offered throughout the year, including educational physician presentations, monthly “Medicare 101” sessions across every geography, on-line resources, in-office materials that explain the difference between traditional Medicare and MA, and patient communications that highlight Medicare election coverage windows.
Competition
 The healthcare industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We currently face competition in every aspect of our business, including in offering a favorable reimbursement structure for existing physician partners and attracting health plan payors and physician partners who are not contracted with us, from a range of companies that provide care under a variety of models that could attract patients, providers and payors. Our primary competitors include ChenMed, Oak Street Health, Optum and VillageMD, in addition to numerous local provider networks, hospitals and health systems. Moreover, large, well-financed payors have in some cases developed their own managed services tools and may provide these services to their physicians and patients at discounted prices, or may seek to expand their relationships with additional competing physicians or physician networks. Other organizations may also seek to apply specialized services or programs, including providing data analytics or disease-based programs, designed to enable physicians or payors to operate successfully under value-based care arrangements. Although some of our competitors utilize elements of our MA multi-payor, globally capitated risk model deployed with community-based physician groups, including in certain of the geographies we serve, we do not believe any of our competitors offer a model that captures all elements of the agilon model. Our competitors typically vary by geography, and we may also encounter competition in the future from other new entrants. Our growth strategy and our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to continue to access existing geographies, successfully expand into new geographies or maintain or establish new relationships with payors and physician partners.
The principal competitive factors in our business include the nature and caliber of relationships with physicians; patient healthcare quality, outcomes and cost; the strength of relationships with payors; the quality of the physician experience; local geography leadership position; and the strength of the underlying economic model. We believe our first-of-its-kind platform, partnership and network model enables us to compete favorably.
Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trademark laws in the U.S. as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets, including proprietary technology, databases and our brand.
We have registered “agilon” and our logo as trademarks in the U.S. We also have filed other trademark applications that are meaningful to our business in the U.S. across various states and local jurisdictions, including for the use of the local brand created within each of our geographies, and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
We are the registered holder of a variety of domain names that include “agilon” and similar variations.
We have developed proprietary technology and processes that support our operational programs and clinical insights, including our “CORE” technology platform and HCC Manager risk adjustment software application, both of which are proprietary systems that aid in the aggregation and analysis of third-party data we collect. Our internally developed technology is continuously refined to support the needs of our platform and partners. Although we do not currently hold a patent for CORE or HCC Manager, we continually assess the most appropriate methods of protecting our intellectual property and may decide to pursue available protections in the future.
We maintain our intellectual property and confidential business information in a number of ways. For instance, we have a policy of requiring all employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. Our employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us in accordance with applicable law. In addition, we have a policy of requiring individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements. Lastly, our agreements with customers include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions.
We may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights, and assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our efforts to promote a positive employee experience and build
culture are further supported and enhanced by local and national in-person and virtual events, including town halls, in-office celebrations, employee activity committees and most-valuable-player awards, meant to champion our employees and create a sense of community. We conduct annual employee engagement surveys to solicit feedback and help guide annual planning on efforts and initiatives to support our team members. We have also developed a taskforce that seeks to drive focused and targeted diversity and inclusion efforts, including employee focus groups and participation up and down the organization to ensure all voices are heard.
Total Rewards
 We recognize how vital our employees are to our success and strive to offer comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits to meet the varying needs of our colleagues and their families. The benefits and programs include annual and long-term incentives, a 401(k) plan, health and welfare insurance benefits, paid time off, flexible work schedules, and family leave, among many others, depending on eligibility.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DE&I")
 We believe a great workplace fosters an environment where all employees can thrive and grow, and where differences are both encouraged and celebrated. We aim to attract, develop, retain and support a diverse workforce that reflects the many members, physician partners, and communities we serve. Under our DE&I Taskforce, we collaborate with our employees to develop and promote an internal diversity, equity and inclusion strategy that aims to foster a culture of inclusion. Our DE&I programs include development programs for high-potential female leaders (expanding opportunity to all under-represented groups), an unconscious bias curriculum, and DE&I training for our workforce.
Training and Development
 We prioritize and invest in creating opportunities to help employees grow and build their careers through a multitude of training and development programs. Our training and development program promotes the importance of compliance across our business. Our employees demonstrate this commitment through our annual Code of Conduct training. We also provide training and development to all employees, focusing on career development, and professional development, including online courses designed to strengthen technical and hard-skills and enhance leadership development. We support career coaching, mentorship and accelerated leadership development programs to ensure mobility and advancement for our employees. Our employees are also encouraged to participate in mentoring programs with people of various backgrounds and cultures. We view mentoring as an essential development tool for sharing skills and knowledge so we can all succeed. Our commitment to mentoring feeds the successful future of our company.
Health & Safety
 The health, safety, and wellness of our employees are vital to our success. We have a strong commitment to providing a safe working environment. From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took a comprehensive approach to managing occupational health and safety challenges presented by the pandemic, including implementing facial covering requirements for our workplaces, providing sick leave, and implementing additional protocols in accordance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) requirements and guidance and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) guidelines for workplaces. In 2020, we quickly and effectively transitioned a significant subset of our employees to a fully remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. To date, our employees have continued to support our partners with the highest level of service from their home offices without a disruption in our business operations. We have taken this opportunity to maintain a fully remote work environment for the vast majority of our employees as part of our culture.
 As of December 31, 2022, agilon and its subsidiaries had 747 employees, substantially all were full-time. None of our employees are members of a labor union, and we have not experienced a work stoppage. Our employees do not include our physician partners, whom we do not directly employ. We believe we enjoy a good working relationship with our employees.
Healthcare and Other Applicable Regulatory Matters
 The healthcare industry is highly regulated under both state and federal laws and regulations. Our operations and relationships with healthcare plans and providers are subject to extensive and increasing regulation by numerous federal, state, and local government agencies including the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the CMS, the Office of Civil Rights, and various state authorities.
Corporate Practice of Medicine
Some states in which we operate have laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine; such laws generally prohibit business entities with non-physician owners, such as agilon and certain of its subsidiaries, from practicing medicine. States that have corporate practice of medicine laws limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprising licensed individuals; therefore, non-medical professional entities are prohibited from employing or contracting with physicians (unless the entity satisfies a limited exception), exercising control over medical decisions, or engaging in certain arrangements with other physicians, such as fee-splitting. These laws vary widely from state to state and change frequently based on new case law, opinions from state attorneys general and regulations promulgated by medical boards. A majority of states have adopted express corporate practice of medicine prohibitions, and several states that have not explicitly adopted the doctrine have, nonetheless, established regulations that echo its principles. A violation of the corporate practice of medicine prohibition constitutes the unlawful practice of medicine, which is a public offense punishable by fines or criminal penalties. In addition, any physician who participates in a scheme that violates the state’s corporate practice of medicine prohibition may be subject to disciplinary action or potential forfeiture of revenues from payors for services rendered, or may be punished for aiding and abetting a non-medical professional entity in the unlawful practice of medicine. We typically operate by forming RBEs which contract with payors on the one hand and provide professional services through contractual relationships with PCPs on the other hand. While we believe that our practices are in substantial compliance with the corporate practice of medicine laws to which we are subject, if a state determines that we are not in compliance that may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. See “Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks—Laws regarding the laws that regulate the corporate practice of medicine, which laws could restrict the manner in which we are permitted to conduct our business, and the failure to comply with such laws, or any changes to such laws or regulations or similar laws or regulations could subject us to penalties and restructuring, or have a material adverse effect on our consolidation of the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries.”
Fee-Splitting Prohibitions
The laws of some states prohibit physicians from splitting with anyone, other than providers who are part of the same group practice, any professional fee, commission, rebate or other form of compensation for any services not actually and personally rendered. Fee-splitting laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities that have broad discretion in their enforcement. Courts in some states have interpreted fee-splitting statutes as prohibiting all percentage of gross revenue and percentage of net profit fee arrangements, despite the performance of legitimate services. In addition, courts have refused to enforce contracts found to violate state fee-splitting prohibitions. Further, fee-splitting arrangements could implicate other laws applicable to our business, such as anti-kickback and corporate practice of medicine laws and regulations.
While we believe we are in substantial compliance with fee-splitting laws in the states in which we operate, if we are found to be non-compliant, penalties for violating fee-splitting statutes or regulations may include medical license revocation, suspension, probation or other disciplinary action against our affiliated providers.
False Claims Acts
We are subject to numerous federal and state laws that prohibit the presentation of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with the submission and payment of medical claims for reimbursement.
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729—3733, impose civil liability on individuals or entities that submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. The False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly or recklessly: presented, or caused to be
presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government; made, used or caused to be made or used a false statement or a false record to get a claim for payment approved, including a false or fraudulent claim; concealed, or knowingly and improperly avoided or decreased, an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or conspired to commit any of the foregoing. The government may deem entities to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information, billing for services not rendered, billing services at a higher payment rate than appropriate and billing for care that is not considered medically necessary. Healthcare-related fraud continues to be the leading source of False Claims Act settlements and judgments.
 The federal government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs. The federal government, including as a result of the passage of the ACA, and a number of courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of certain other statutes, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) or the federal physician referral law, 42 U.S.C. 1395nn (the “Stark Law”), can also be considered a violation of the False Claims Act. Some government healthcare programs, including, but not limited to, the MA program, use a risk-adjustment model that adjusts premiums paid to contracted payors to reflect the specific characteristics of each enrolled member (including demographics, government program eligibility and health status). Many payors and government healthcare programs have set forth specific documentation rules that must be followed in compliantly selecting allowable codes. We rely on physician partners to follow the CMS documentation rules and code their claim submissions with accurate and substantially documented diagnoses, which we send to the payors, some of whom, in turn, submit the data to government healthcare agencies including CMS. In recent years, the DOJ has brought a number of investigations and actions under the federal False Claims Act against both payors and providers for alleged upcoding or improper coding of diagnosis coding under the risk-adjustment methodology. Further, amendments to the federal False Claims Act and Social Security Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from government payors. On December 14, 2022, CMS released a proposed rule (“2022 Proposed Rule”) that, among other things, revises the existing regulatory negligence standard for when an overpayment is “identified,” following a decision that vacated the “reasonable diligence” standard. The 2022 Proposed Rule would provide that “[a] person has identified an overpayment when the person knowingly receives or retains an overpayment.” The proposal references the definition of “knowingly” under the False Claims Act, which extends to actual knowledge, reckless disregard, and willful blindness.
 A number of states have enacted laws that are similar to the federal False Claims Act. Under Section 6031 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, as amended, if a state enacts a false claims act that is at least as stringent as the federal statute and that also meets certain other requirements, the state will be eligible to receive a greater share of any monetary recovery obtained pursuant to certain actions brought under the state’s false claims act. As a result, more states are expected to enact laws that are similar to the federal False Claims Act in the future along with a corresponding increase in state false claims enforcement efforts. Violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including significant penalties, fines, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight under a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, and/or exclusion or suspension from federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include substantial fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the government. In addition to the provisions of the False Claims Act, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government also can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims to the government for payments. Additionally, private parties may initiate qui tam whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the False Claims Act in the name of the federal government, as well as under the false claims laws of several states, and may share in the proceeds of a successful suit. Generally, federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse a priority.
Federal and State Anti-Kickback Statutes
The AKS, set forth in Section 1128B of the Social Security Act, prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person for items or services reimbursable under federal healthcare programs, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under federal healthcare programs or (iii) the purchase, lease or order or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under federal healthcare
programs. The core of a violation of the AKS is an “inducement” to refer patients for services or items that are reimbursed under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare, Medicaid, or Tricare (which covers military personnel). Kickbacks undermine the integrity of federal healthcare programs by tainting medical decision-making, increasing healthcare costs and negatively impacting competition. The ACA amended the AKS to make it clear that a person need not have actual knowledge of the statute, or specific intent to violate the statute, as a predicate for a violation. Court cases have resulted in the interpretation that a violation may occur where even one purpose of the remuneration is to induce or reward referrals, and the OIG, which has the authority to impose administrative sanctions for violation of the statute, has adopted a similar standard.
There are certain AKS “safe harbors” which, if the respective requirements are met, would afford protection from the AKS. Failure to meet all requirements of an AKS safe harbor does not necessarily mean the arrangement violates the AKS, but it may be subject to scrutiny by legal authorities, in light of the parties’ intent and arrangements. In other words, if an arrangement does not fit within a safe harbor, it does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is per se illegal—only that it is not shielded from regulatory scrutiny. The federal AKS provides criminal penalties for individuals or entities that knowingly and willfully solicit or receive any remuneration. A violation of the AKS is punishable by imprisonment of up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per offense, or both. Violation can also give rise to federal healthcare program exclusion, liability under the False Claims Act and civil penalties, which may include monetary penalties of up to $100,000 per offense, repayments of up to three times the total payments between the parties to the arrangement and suspension from future participation in Medicare and Medicaid.
We have endeavored to structure our business arrangements to fit within applicable federal AKS safe harbors and to otherwise operate in material compliance with the AKS. Federal courts in the U.S., for instance, have recognized that a referring party’s provision of legitimate services to a referral recipient may not constitute prohibited remuneration for AKS purposes when the referral recipient pays fair market value in return for what it receives. Many of our arrangements are structured to provide for compensation that is fair market value for services actually rendered and in a manner that does not reflect the volume or value of referrals generated between the parties. In structuring our relationships with providers, including our physician partners, and other healthcare entities, we are careful to try to ensure wherever possible that we are in compliance with all of the regulatory requirements of such safe harbors and exceptions. In particular, a key managed care safe harbor under the AKS upon which we regularly rely allows for payments to providers for “healthcare services and items,” but does not allow incentive payments for marketing or to encourage member enrollment. We therefore carefully analyze all payment structures to ensure that they constitute “services and items” that fall within this safe harbor or are otherwise in compliance with the AKS.
Additionally, some states have enacted statutes and regulations similar to the AKS, but which may be applicable regardless of the payor source for the patient. These state laws may contain exceptions and safe harbors that are different from and/or more limited than those of federal law and that may vary from state to state.
To help accelerate the U.S. healthcare system’s transition from a FFS to a value-based system, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) launched the “Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care” initiative (“Regulatory Sprint”) in 2018, which aims to change the manner in which the healthcare regulatory framework has traditionally been applied to stakeholder arrangements. In connection with the Regulatory Sprint, the OIG issued final rules amending the AKS by adding new safe harbors and modifying existing safe harbors that protect certain payment practices and business arrangements from sanctions under the AKS in order to remove potential barriers to more effective coordination and management of patient care and delivery of value-based care. Among other changes, the new regulations contain safe harbors for value-based arrangements centering around value-based enterprises, which are enterprises composed of participants collaborating to achieve one or more value-based purposes, including coordinating and managing the care of a target patient population and coordinating and managing the care of a target population. These new final rules provide additional protections to our payment models with providers.
We have also endeavored to structure our participation in the Direct Contracting Model to comply with waivers of the AKS issued by the Secretary of HHS. The conditions of such waivers are to ensure that protected arrangements: (i) are consistent with the quality, care coordination, and cost-reduction goals of the Direct Contracting Model, (ii) are subject to safeguards designed to mitigate the risk of fraud and abuse; and (iii) can be readily monitored and audited.
Stark Law
The Stark Law generally prohibits a physician from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity providing designated health services (“DHS”) if such physician, or a member of the physician’s immediate family, has a financial relationship with the entity, unless a specific exception applies. DHS is defined to mean any of the following enumerated items or services: clinical laboratory services; physical therapy services; occupational therapy services; radiology services, including magnetic resonance imaging, computerized axial tomography scans and ultrasound services; radiation therapy services and supplies; durable medical equipment and supplies; parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment and supplies; prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies; home health services; outpatient prescription drugs; inpatient and outpatient hospital services; and outpatient speech-language pathology services. The types of financial arrangements between the referring physician and an entity providing DHS that trigger the Stark Law are broad, including direct and indirect ownership and investment interests, and compensation arrangements. The Stark Law also prohibits any entity providing DHS and receiving a prohibited referral from presenting, or causing to be presented, a claim or billing for the services arising out of the prohibited referral. Similarly, the Stark Law prohibits an entity from “furnishing” a DHS to another entity in which it has a financial relationship when that entity bills for the service. The Stark Law also prohibits self-referrals within an organization by its own physicians, although broad exceptions exist that cover employed physicians and those referring DHS that are ancillary to the physician’s practice to the physician group. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral; intent to induce referrals is not required. Like the federal AKS, the federal Stark Law contains statutory and regulatory exceptions intended to protect certain types of transactions and arrangements. If the Stark Law is implicated, the financial relationship must fully satisfy a Stark Law exception; if an exception is not satisfied, then the parties to the arrangement could be subject to sanctions. Sanctions for violation of the Stark Law include denial of payment for claims for services provided in violation of the prohibition, refunds of amounts collected in violation of the prohibition, a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral, a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law prohibition, civil assessment of up to three times the amount claimed, and potential exclusion from the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Amounts collected on claims related to prohibited referrals must be reported and refunded generally within sixty (60) days after the date on which the overpayment was identified. Furthermore, Stark Law violations and failure to return overpayments in a timely manner can form the basis for False Claims Act liability, as further discussed herein. Additionally, several states have enacted physician self-referral laws.
Notably, compensation pursuant to a risk-sharing arrangement between a managed care organization or an independent practice association and a physician (either directly or indirectly through a contractor) for services provided to enrollees of a health plan (an MA plan, for example) does not constitute a financial arrangement for Stark purposes. Further, physician incentive plans (“PIPs”) are allowable provided that (i) the compensation is not determined in any manner (withhold, capitation, bonus, or otherwise) that takes into account, directly or indirectly, volume or value of referrals and (ii) the PIP does not induce the reduction of medically necessary care to individual patients and does not place the physician at substantial financial risk for services not provided by the physician.
As part of the Regulatory Sprint, CMS also issued a sweeping set of regulations that introduce significant new value-based terminology and exceptions to the Stark Law. CMS has implemented new exceptions for certain remuneration exchanged between or among eligible participants in value-based arrangements. These exceptions and their various requirements apply based on the level of risk assumed by the arrangement’s participants. These new regulations purport to ease the compliance burden for healthcare providers across the industry while maintaining strong safeguards to protect patients and programs from fraud and abuse. These or other changes may change the parameters of the Stark Law exceptions that we rely upon and impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Section 1876 of the Social Security Act
Section 1876 of the Social Security Act prohibits MA plans and their downstream entities from entering into compensation arrangements with physicians that may directly or indirectly have an effect of reducing or limiting services to individual members. We have sought to structure our compensation arrangements with physicians to ensure compliance with this requirement.
Health Care Fraud Statute
The Health Care Fraud Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1347, prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, which can be either a government or private payor plan. Violation of this statute, even in the absence of actual knowledge of or specific intent to violate the statute, may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment or both. The Health Care False Statement Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1035, prohibits, in any matter involving a federal healthcare program, anyone from knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up, by any trick, scheme or device, a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing that it contains a materially false or fraudulent statement. A violation of this statute may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment, or both.
Civil Monetary Penalties Statute
The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMPL”), 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a, authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments, and exclusions against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to: (i) presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that the individual or entity knows or should know are for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent; (ii) offering remuneration to a federal healthcare program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive healthcare items or services from a particular provider; (iii) arranging contracts with an entity or individual excluded from participation in a federal healthcare program; (iv) violating the federal AKS; (v) making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment for items and services furnished under a federal healthcare program; (vi) making, using, or causing to be made any false statement, omission, or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid, or contract to participate or enroll as a provider of services or a supplier under a federal healthcare program; and (vii) failing to report and return an overpayment owed to the federal government. We could be exposed to a wide range of allegations to which the federal CMPL would apply. We perform monthly checks on our employees, affiliated providers and certain affiliates and vendors using government databases to confirm that these individuals have not been excluded from federal programs. However, should an individual become excluded and we fail to detect it, a federal agency could require us to refund amounts attributable to all claims or services performed or sufficiently linked to an excluded individual. Thus, we cannot foreclose the possibility that we will face allegations subject to the CMPL with the potential for a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Substantial civil monetary penalties may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute and may vary, depending on the underlying violation. In addition, an assessment of not more than three (3) times the total amount claimed for each item or service may also apply, and a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs.
Federal and State Insurance and Managed Care Laws
Regulation of downstream risk-sharing arrangements, including, but not limited to, global risk and other value-based arrangements, varies significantly from state to state. Some states require downstream entities and RBEs to obtain an insurance license, a certificate of authority, or an equivalent authorization, in order to participate in downstream risk-sharing arrangements with payors. In some states, statutes, regulations and/or formal guidance explicitly address whether and in what manner the state regulates the transfer of risk by a payor to a downstream entity. However, the majority of states do not explicitly address the issue, and in such states, regulators may nonetheless interpret statutes and regulations to regulate such activity. If downstream risk-sharing arrangements are not regulated directly in a particular state, the state regulatory agency may nonetheless require oversight by the licensed payor as the party to such a downstream risk-sharing arrangement. Such oversight is accomplished via contract and may include the imposition of reserve requirements, as well as reporting obligations. Further, state regulatory stances regarding downstream risk-sharing arrangements can change rapidly and codified provisions may not keep pace with evolving risk-sharing mechanisms.
Healthcare Reform
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) and the accompanying Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the ACA, were enacted. The ACA includes a variety of healthcare reform provisions and requirements, which continue to be implemented and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers.
However, due to government action over the last several years, a number of changes have been made to the provisions of the ACA since 2010, including reduced funding. Looking forward, the future of the ACA and its underlying programs are subject to continuing and substantial uncertainty, making long-term business planning exceedingly difficult. Because of the continued uncertainty about the implementation of the ACA, including the timing of and potential for further legal challenges, repeal or amendment of that legislation and the future of the health insurance exchanges, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of the ACA on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.
 The CMS Innovation Center continues to test an array of alternative payment models, including the Direct Contracting Model to allow DCEs to negotiate directly with the government to manage traditional Medicare beneficiaries and share in the savings and losses generated from managing such beneficiaries. State regulation of DCEs will likely be variable. For example, certain states may require DCEs to obtain specific licensure to participate in the Direct Contracting Model and assume risk directly from CMS. There likely will continue to be regulatory proposals directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Further, CMS also routinely adjusts the risk adjustment factor which is central to payment under the MA program. The monetary “coefficient” values associated with diseases that we manage in our population are subject to change by CMS. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
In February 2022, the CMS Innovation Center announced that it is redesigning the Direct Contracting model and renaming it the ACO REACH Model. The ACO REACH Model aims to improve quality of care through better care coordination and increased access to accountable care in underserved communities. The CMS Innovation Center concurrently introduced a Request for Applications (RFA) for a new cohort to begin the model on January 1, 2023, and it announced that all current Direct Contracting model participants that meet ACO REACH requirements would be permitted to continue participating in the ACO REACH model as ACOs. The ACO REACH requirements outlined thus far include the development and implementation of a robust health equity plan to identify disparities in care and better serve underserved communities; the requirement that at least 75% control of each ACO's governing body be held by participating providers or their designated representatives (compared to 25% during the first two performance years of the Direct Contracting model); and the requirement that there be at least two beneficiary advocates on the governing board (at least one Medicare beneficiary and at least one consumer advocate), both of whom must hold voting rights. We began our participation in the ACO REACH Model in January 2023, and these new requirements have not had a material impact on our current or future participation in this program, or inhibited our ability to continue and grow our participation in the model. In addition, the CMS Innovation Center announced that ACO REACH would include technical adjustments to the model’s parameters, including changes to benchmark calculations. The overall effect of these changes has been minimal thus far.
 Federal and State Privacy and Security Requirements
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and rules regarding the use, security and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”), personally identifiable information, de-identified data and other categories of confidential or legally protected data that our businesses may handle. Such laws and rules include, without limitation, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45 (“FTC Act”) and state privacy and security laws. Privacy and security laws and regulations often change due to new or amended legislation, regulations or administrative interpretation. We are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to securely process, transmit and store this information. We also utilize third-party service providers for important aspects of the collection, storage and transmission of such sensitive information.
Congress enacted HIPAA, in part, to combat healthcare fraud and to protect the privacy and security of patients’ individually identifiable healthcare information. Among other things, HIPAA requires healthcare providers and their
business associates to maintain the privacy and security of individually identifiable PHI. The HIPAA Security Rule requires both covered entities and business associates to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to PHI, including adherence to HIPAA’s security standards through the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect PHI. Additionally, the Privacy Rule contains requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals’ PHI, including a prohibition on a covered entity or business associate using or disclosing an individual’s PHI unless the use or disclosure is authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the Privacy Rule. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health of 2009 (“HITECH”) dramatically expanded, among other things, (1) the scope of HIPAA to now apply directly to “business associates,” or independent contractors who receive or obtain PHI in connection with providing a service to a covered entity or another business associate, (2) substantive security and privacy obligations, including a new federal security breach notification requirement that unauthorized acquisitions, access, use or disclosure of PHI be reported to, depending on the number of people affected and their location, affected individuals, the Department of Health and Human Services and local media outlets, (3) restrictions on marketing communications, a prohibition on business associates from receiving remuneration in exchange for PHI, and a prohibition on covered entities from receiving remuneration in exchange for PHI without express patient authorization and (4) the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed for HIPAA violations. Pursuant to HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, we are required to report breaches of unsecured PHI to our covered entity clients, such as our physician group partners, within 60 days of discovery of the breach, and notify certain agencies and potentially the media in accordance with clause (2) above. We have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. Any interruption in access to member information, unauthorized access to information, improper disclosure or other loss of information could result in, among other things, federal or state government investigations and liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy of member information, such as HIPAA, potentially resulting in damages and regulatory penalties.
HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic audits of covered entities and business associates for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. HIPAA imposes penalties for certain violations, subject to a cap of $1.5 million for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year. A single data privacy or data security incident can, in the view of HHS, result in violations of multiple standards. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their states’ residents. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in federal court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as a basis for establishing a duty of care in state-law civil suits alleging negligence or recklessness for the misuse of PHI. A finding of liability under HIPAA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In order to ensure compliance, we encrypt and back up data, maintain company-wide security awareness training, enter into business associate agreements with our partners, as well as ensure our partners have implemented physical security and safeguards at the data centers where our data is stored and conduct regular internal and external security audits. Although we employ administrative, physical and technological safeguards to help protect confidential and other sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure, and that of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses, failures or breaches due to third-party action and employee (including contractor) negligence, error or malfeasance.
Additionally, many states also enacted laws that protect the privacy and security of confidential, personal and health information, which may be even more stringent than HIPAA and may add additional compliance costs and legal risks to our operations. Some state privacy and security laws overlap with federal law, some of which are preempted, in part, by federal laws, whereas others are not. States have also passed privacy and security laws and regulations that apply across sectors and go beyond federal law, such as data security laws, secure destruction, Social Security number privacy, online privacy, biometric information privacy, and data breach notification laws. Some of these state laws may impose fines and penalties on violators and may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused.
We are also subject to a provision of the federal 21st Century Cures Act that is intended to facilitate the appropriate exchange of health information. In May 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and CMS issued complementary new rules that are intended to clarify provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act. The rules, intended to enhance interoperability and prevent information blocking, create significant new requirements for healthcare industry participants, including requirements to (i) provide patients with convenient access to health care information, (ii) support electronic exchange of data for transitions of care and (iii) require participation in trust networks to improve
interoperability. The 21st Century Cures Act authorizes civil monetary penalties up to $1 million per information blocking “violation.” It is unclear at this time what the costs of compliance with the new rules will be, and what additional risks there may be to our business. Looking ahead, it is possible that the American Data Privacy and Protection Act (“ADPPA”), a landmark federal privacy bill with significant bipartisan support, may gain traction. Although ADPPA would not apply to health data covered by HIPAA, it would apply to other health data, such as health data controlled by certain entities in the digital health space. Various other federal and state laws may apply that restrict the use and protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable information, as well as employee personal information, including certain state laws modeled to some extent on the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws that do not on their face specifically address data privacy or security, have been applied to data privacy and security matters by a range of government agencies and courts.
Consumer Protection Laws
Healthcare providers are also subject to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), which regulates the manner in which a business may advertise its products and services to consumers by phone, text and fax. The TCPA was enacted by Congress to combat aggressive telemarketing and fax advertising practices believed to invade consumer privacy. The TCPA also regulates the use of automated equipment to deliver calls or text messages to mobile phones without prior express consent. Congress empowered the FCC to interpret the TCPA through rules, regulations and declaratory rulings. A 2015 order from the FCC clarified that calls or text messages that have an express healthcare-related purpose—such as treatment follow-up, appointment confirmations and reminders or pre-operative instructions—are exempt from the TCPA. In these instances, providers are not required to receive prior express consent from patients before reaching out by phone or text. As healthcare companies, such as ourselves, increasingly rely on mobile delivery platforms and other technologies to communicate with patients about appointments, billing and other issues, the potential for legal exposure under the TCPA also increases. Each call or text made in violation of the TCPA can cost up to $1,500 per instance in fines and damages. Because there is no cap on statutory damages, violations can result in millions of dollars in penalties.
Competition and Antitrust Laws
We are subject to numerous statutes that govern competition in our industry, including the Sherman Act, the FTC Act and the Clayton Act. The Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-7, outlaws “every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade,” and any “monopolization, attempted monopolization, or conspiracy or combination to monopolize.” The penalties for violating the Sherman Act can be severe. Most enforcement actions are civil, but individuals and businesses that violate the Sherman Act may be prosecuted criminally by the DOJ. Criminal prosecutions are typically limited to clear violations, such as when competitors fix prices, allocate markets or rig bids. The Sherman Act imposes criminal penalties of up to $100 million for a corporation and $1 million for an individual, along with up to 10 years in prison. Under federal law, the maximum fine may be increased to twice the amount the conspirators gained from the illegal acts or twice the money lost by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is more than $100 million.
The FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 41-58, bans “unfair methods of competition” and “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.” The Supreme Court has said that all violations of the Sherman Act also violate the FTC Act. Thus, although the FTC does not technically enforce the Sherman Act, it can bring cases under the FTC Act against the same kinds of activities that violate the Sherman Act. The FTC Act also reaches other practices that harm competition, but that may not fit neatly into categories of conduct formally prohibited by the Sherman Act. Only the FTC brings cases under the FTC Act.
The Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 12-27, addresses specific practices that the Sherman Act does not clearly prohibit, such as mergers and interlocking directorates (that is, the same person serving as an officer or director of two competing companies). Section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits mergers and acquisitions where the effect “may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.” As amended by the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, 15 U.S.C. § 13, the Clayton Act also bans certain discriminatory prices, services and allowances in dealings between merchants. The Clayton Act was amended again in 1976 by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18a, to require companies planning large mergers or acquisitions to notify the government of their plans in advance. The Clayton Act also authorizes private parties to sue for treble damages when they have been
harmed by conduct that violates either the Sherman or Clayton Act and to obtain a court order prohibiting the anticompetitive practice in the future.
In addition to these federal statutes, most states have antitrust laws that are enforced by state attorneys general or private plaintiffs. Many state statutory provisions are based on federal antitrust law, namely, Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and Sections 3 and 7 of the Clayton Act. Further complicating matters, state lawmakers are increasingly seeking to exercise oversight over healthcare transactions and allow state agencies to analyze potential anticompetitive effects of healthcare consolidation, including smaller transactions that do not meet federal reporting thresholds.
 As the healthcare industry has continued to evolve in response to consumer demand and competition in the marketplace, the effect of the antitrust laws in healthcare is also changing. We have expanded our operations significantly since our inception, organically as well as through acquisitions. Such growth, and our long-term contracts with physician partners, could expose us to risks related to antitrust investigations and litigation. Competition and antitrust law inquiries often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines.
Other Laws and Regulations
Some states in which we operate require licensing or registration for operations related to, among others, utilization review on behalf of payors, including reviewing medical necessity and appropriateness of healthcare services, or processing claims in connection with insurance or managed care products. Such laws vary from state to state, and our operations may be subject to exemption in certain states.
Additionally, our physician partners are subject to numerous federal, state and local licensing laws and regulations, relating to, among other things, professional credentialing and professional ethics. Our physician partners, as well as their nurse practitioners, must satisfy and maintain their individual professional licensing in each state where they practice medicine.
Further, organizations that receive reimbursement from a federal or state government payor are expected by the federal government to have a compliance program. For those organizations that do not receive reimbursement from any federal or state government payors, a compliance program is not mandatory but is considered best practice. As a result, we maintain a program to monitor compliance with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to healthcare entities. We have a compliance department that is charged with implementing and supervising our compliance program, which includes the adoption of (i) a Code of Conduct for our employees and affiliates and (ii) a process that specifies how employees, affiliates and others may report regulatory or ethical concerns to our compliance officer. We believe that our compliance program meets the relevant standards provided by the OIG of the Department of Health and Human Services. An important part of our compliance program consists of conducting periodic audits of various aspects of our operations. We also conduct mandatory educational programs designed to familiarize our employees with the regulatory requirements and specific elements of our compliance program.
We are also impacted by federal and state laws and policies that require providers to enroll in the Medicare program before submitting any claims for services, to promptly report certain changes in its operations to the agencies that administer these programs, and to re-enroll in these programs when changes in direct or indirect ownership occur or in response to revalidation requests from Medicare.
