GENERAL
We were founded in 1963 as an oil and natural gas contract drilling company. Today, besides our drilling operations, we have operations in the exploration and production and mid-stream areas. We operate, manage, and analyze our results of operations through our three principal business segments:
•Oil and Natural Gas – carried out by our subsidiary Unit Petroleum Company. This segment explores, develops, acquires, and produces oil and natural gas properties for our account.
•Contract Drilling – carried out by our subsidiary Unit Drilling Company. This segment contracts to drill onshore oil and natural gas wells for others and our account.
•Mid-Stream – carried out by our subsidiary Superior Pipeline Company, L.L.C., and its subsidiaries (Superior). This segment buys, sells, gathers, processes, and treats natural gas for third parties and our account.
Each company may conduct operations through subsidiaries of its own.
This table provides certain information about us as of February 12, 2019:

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS
See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information regarding each of our segment’s revenues, profits or losses, and total assets.
OIL AND NATURAL GAS
General. All our oil and natural gas properties are in the United States. Our producing oil and natural gas properties, unproved properties, and related assets are in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, and Utah.
When we are the operator of a property, we try to drill wells using a drilling rig owned by our contract drilling segment, and we use our mid-stream segment to gather our gas if it is economical to do so.
This table presents certain information regarding our oil and natural gas operations as of December 31, 2018: 

 | NumberofGrossWells | Numberof NetWells | Numberof GrossWells inProcess | Numberof NetWells inProcess | 2018 AverageNet Daily Production | | 
 | | | | | NaturalGas(Mcf) | Oil(Bbls) | NGLs (Bbls)
Total | 6,322 | 2,337.98 | 49 | 6.00 | 152,398 | 7,874 | 13,494 

As of December 31, 2018, we had no significant water floods, pressure maintenance operations, or any other material related activities in process.
Acquisitions. On April 3, 2017, we closed an acquisition of certain oil and natural gas assets located primarily in Grady and Caddo Counties in western Oklahoma. The final adjusted value of consideration given was $54.3 million. As of January 1, 2017, the effective date of the acquisition, the estimated proved oil and gas reserves of the acquired properties were 3.2 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe). The acquisition added approximately 8,300 net oil and gas leasehold acres to our core Hoxbar area in southwestern Oklahoma including approximately 47 proved developed producing wells. This acquisition included 13 potential horizontal drilling locations not otherwise included in our existing acreage. Of the acreage acquired, approximately 71% was held by production. We also received one gathering system as part of the transaction.
In December 2018, we closed on an acquisition of certain oil and natural gas assets located primarily in Custer County, Oklahoma. The total preliminary adjusted value of consideration was $29.6 million. As of November 1, 2018, the effective date of the acquisition, the estimated proved oil and gas reserves for the acquired properties was 2.6 MMBoe net to us. The acquisition added approximately 8,667 net oil and gas leasehold acres to our Penn Sands area in Oklahoma including approximately 44 wells. The acquisitions included approximately 30 potential horizontal drilling locations which are anticipated to have a high percentage of oil relative to the total production stream. Of the acreage acquired, approximately 82% was held by production.
Dispositions. We had non-core asset sales, net of related expenses, of $22.5 million, $18.6 million, and $67.2 million, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Proceeds from these sales reduced the net book value of the full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized. 
During prior years, we determined the value of some of our unproved oil and gas properties were diminished (in part or whole) based on an impairment evaluation and our anticipated future exploration plans. Those determinations resulted in $7.6 million and $10.5 million in 2016 and 2017, respectively, of costs being added to the total of our capitalized costs being amortized. We incurred a $161.6 million pre-tax ($100.6 million net of tax) non-cash ceiling test write-down of our oil and natural gas properties in 2016 primarily due to the reduction of the 12-month average commodity prices during the first three quarters of the year. We had no ceiling test write-downs for 2017 or 2018.

1.Excludes ad valorem taxes and gross production taxes.
Our Buffalo Wallow field in Hemphill County, Texas, contained 29%, 24%, and 13% of our total proved reserves in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, expressed on an oil-equivalent barrels basis. Our Jazz Wilcox field in South Texas, which includes our Gilly, Segno, and Wildwood prospects and several smaller prospects, contained 14%, 18%, and 26% of our total proved reserves for those same years also expressed on an oil-equivalent barrels basis. There are no other fields that accounted for more than 15% of our proved reserves.
Oil, NGLs, and Natural Gas Reserves. The following table identifies our estimated proved developed and undeveloped oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves: 

 | Year Ended December 31, 2018 | | | 
 | Oil(MBbls) | NGLs (MBbls) | NaturalGas(MMcf) | TotalProvedReserves(MBoe)
Total proved developed | 15,192 | 33,515 | 377,216 | 111,576 
Total proved undeveloped | 7,366 | 14,281 | 158,747 | 48,105 
Total proved | 22,558 | 47,796 | 535,963 | 159,681 

Oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves cannot be measured exactly. Estimates of those reserves require extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and are generally less precise than other estimates made in financial disclosures. We use Ryder Scott Company, L.P., (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum consultants, to audit the reserves prepared by our reservoir engineers. Ryder Scott has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world since 1937. Their summary report is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. The wells or locations for which reserve estimates were audited were taken from our reserve and income projections as of December 31, 2018, and comprised 83% of the total proved developed future net income discounted at 10% and 82% of the total proved discounted future net income (based on the SEC's unescalated pricing policy).
Our Reservoir Engineering department is responsible for reserve determination for the wells in which we have an interest. Their primary objective is to estimate the wells' future reserves and future net value to us. Data is incorporated from multiple
 sources including geological, production engineering, marketing, production, land, and accounting departments. The engineers review this information for accuracy as it is incorporated into the reservoir engineering database. Our internal audit group reviews our internal controls to help provide assurance all the data has been provided. New well reserve estimates are provided to management and the respective operational divisions for additional scrutiny. Major reserve changes on existing wells are reviewed regularly with the operational divisions to confirm completeness and accuracy. As the external audit is being completed by Ryder Scott, the reservoir department reviews all properties for accuracy of forecasting.

Definitions and Other. Proved oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves, as defined in SEC Rule 4-10(a), are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be
 economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations – before the time the contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
The area of the reservoir considered as "proved" includes:
•The area identified by drilling and limited by any fluid contacts, and
•Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with the reservoir and to contain economically producible oil or gas based on available geosciences and engineering data.
Absent data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as incurred in a well penetration unless geosciences, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geosciences, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:
•Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than the reservoir as a whole;
•The operation of an installed program in the reservoir or other evidence using reliable technology establishes reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and
•The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price used is the average of the prices over the 12 months before the ending date of the period covered by the report and is an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based on future conditions.
"Proved developed" oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves are proved reserves expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor to the cost of a new well. It can also be recovered through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
"Proved undeveloped" oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves are proved reserves expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. Under no circumstances can estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless those techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves. As of December 31, 2018, we had 158 gross proved undeveloped wells all of which we plan to develop within five years of initial disclosure at a net estimated cost of approximately $397.4 million. The future estimated development costs to develop our proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves for the years 2019-2023, as disclosed in our December 31, 2018 oil and natural gas reserve report, are shown below:

Year | Number of Gross Wells Planned | Estimated Net Development Cost (In millions)
2019 | 73 | $ | 104.2
2020 | 47 | 135.8 
2021 | 26 | 97.6 
2022 | 10 | 48.8 
2023 | 2 | 11.0 
 | 158 | $ | 397.4

Our proved undeveloped reserves reported at December 31, 2018 did not include reserves we did not expect to develop within five years of initial disclosure of those reserves. Below, we summarize changes to our proved undeveloped reserves during 2018: 

 | Oil (MMBbls) | NGLs (MMBbls) | Natural Gas (Bcf) | Total (MMBoe)
Proved undeveloped reserves, January 1, 2018 | 4.7 | 12.1 | 120.2 | 36.8 
Extensions and discoveries | 3.3 | 4.6 | 59.4 | 17.8 
Converted to developed | (1.6) | (2.3) | (17.3) | (6.8) 
Revisions of previous estimates | 0.4 | (0.5) | (6.2) | (1.1) 
Purchases of reserves | 0.6 | 0.4 | 2.6 | 1.4 
Proved undeveloped reserves, December 31, 2018 | 7.4 | 14.3 | 158.7 | 48.1 

During 2018, we converted 18 proved undeveloped well locations into proved developed wells at a cost of approximately $76.3 million. The increase in the table above to our extensions and discoveries were due to several factors including increased drilling activity, higher commodity prices resulting in an increased budget for future capital expenditures, all contributing to more wells being economical to develop in the next five years.
Our estimated proved reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of the proved reserves at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the changes in quantities, and standardized measure of those reserves for the three years then ended, are shown in the Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in Item 8 of this report.
Contracts. Our oil production is sold at or near our wells under purchase contracts at prevailing prices under arrangements customary in the oil industry. Our natural gas production is sold to intrastate and interstate pipelines and independent marketing firms under contracts with terms generally ranging from one month to a year. Few of these contracts contain provisions for readjustment of price as most are market sensitive.
Customers. During 2018, sales to CVR Refining, LP and Valero Energy Corporation accounted for 14% and 10% of our oil and natural gas revenues, respectively. Besides our mid-stream segment, no other company accounted for over 10% of our oil and natural gas revenues. During 2018, our mid-stream segment purchased $81.4 million of our natural gas and NGLs production and provided gathering and transportation services of $7.3 million. Intercompany revenue from services and purchases of production between our mid-stream segment and our oil and natural gas segment has been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. In 2017 and 2016, we eliminated intercompany revenues of $69.9 million and $51.9 million, respectively, attributable to the intercompany purchase of our production of natural gas and NGLs and gathering and transportation services.
CONTRACT DRILLING
General. Our contract drilling business is conducted through Unit Drilling Company. Through this company we drill onshore oil and natural gas wells for our account and others. Our drilling operations are in Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and North Dakota.
This table identifies certain information about our contract drilling segment:

1.In December 2018, we removed from service 41 drilling rigs, tubulars, hydraulic top drives, mud pumps, and other drilling equipment.
2.Utilization rate is determined by dividing the average number of drilling rigs used by the average number of drilling rigs owned during the year.
3.Represents the total revenues from our contract drilling segment divided by the total days our drilling rigs were used during the year.
Description and Location of Our Drilling Rigs. An on-shore drilling rig is composed of major equipment components like engines, drawworks or hoists, derrick or mast, substructure, mud pumps, blowout preventers, top drives, and drill pipe. Because of the normal wear and tear from operating 24 hours a day, several of the major components, like engines, mud pumps, top drives, and drill pipe, must be replaced or rebuilt periodically. Other major components, like the substructure, mast, and drawworks, can be used for extended periods with proper maintenance. We also own additional equipment used in operating our drilling rigs, including iron roughnecks, automated catwalks, skidding systems, large air compressors, trucks, and other support equipment. Our drilling rigs can be transferred between divisions.
The maximum depth capacities of our various drilling rigs range from 9,500 to 40,000 feet allowing us to cover a wide range of our customers drilling requirements. In 2018, 38 of our 55 drilling rigs were used in drilling services. 
This table shows certain information about our drilling rigs as of February 12, 2019:

 | ContractedRigs | Non-ContractedRigs | TotalRigs | AverageRatedDrillingDepth(ft)
Drilling Rigs | 30 | 26 | 56 | 20,196 

Fluctuating commodity prices directly affect drilling rig utilization rates, both positively and negatively. We saw this during 2018 as commodity prices improved from the fourth quarter of 2017 through the middle of 2018, so did drilling rig utilization. Commodity prices then declined in the fourth quarter of 2018 and rig utilization followed.
At any given time the number of drilling rigs we can work depends on several conditions besides demand, including the availability of qualified labor and the availability of needed drilling supplies and equipment. The impact of these conditions affects the demand for our drilling rigs. Our average utilization rate for 2018, 2017, and 2016 was 34%, 32%, and 19%, respectively.
The following table shows the average number of our drilling rigs working by quarter for the years indicated: 

 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016
First quarter | 31.7 | 25.5 | 20.6
Second quarter | 32.2 | 28.8 | 13.5
Third quarter | 34.2 | 34.6 | 16.0
Fourth quarter | 33.1 | 31.2 | 19.5

Drilling Rig Fleet. The following table summarizes the changes to our drilling rig fleet in 2018. A more complete discussion of changes over the last three years follows the table: 

Drilling rigs available for use on January 1, 2018 | 95 
Drilling rigs removed from service (1) | (41)
Drilling rigs constructed | 1 
Total drilling rigs available for use on December 31, 2018 | 55 

_______________________ 
1.In December 2018, we removed from service 41 drilling rigs, tubulars, hydraulic top drives, mud pumps, and other drilling equipment.
Dispositions, Acquisitions, and Construction. During December 2016, we sold an idle 1,500 horsepower SCR drilling rig to an unaffiliated third party. We also built and placed into service for a third party operator our ninth BOSS drilling rig. 
During 2017, we built our tenth BOSS drilling rig and placed it into service for a third party operator under a long term contract.
During 2018, we built our eleventh BOSS drilling rig and placed it into service for a third party operator under a long term contract.
In December 2018, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell 41 drilling rigs (29 mechanical drilling rigs and 12 SCR diesel-electric drilling rigs) and other equipment. This plan satisfies the criteria of assets held for sale under ASC 360-10-45-9. Over the last five years, only six of our drilling rigs in the fleet have not been utilized. We made a strategic decision to focus on our new BOSS drilling rigs and specific SCR drilling rigs (good candidates for modification) and sell the other drilling rigs that we now choose not to market. We estimated the fair value of the 41 drilling rigs we will no longer market based on the estimated market value from third-party assessments (Level 3 fair value measurement) less cost to sell. Based on these estimates, we recorded a non-cash write-down of approximately $147.9 million, pre-tax ($111.7 million, net of tax).
Drilling Contracts. Our drilling contracts are generally obtained through competitive bidding on a well by well basis. Contract terms and payment rates vary depending on the type of contract used, the duration of the work, the equipment and services supplied, and other matters. We pay certain operating expenses, including the wages of our drilling rig personnel, maintenance expenses, and incidental drilling rig supplies and equipment. The contracts are usually subject to early termination by the customer subject to the payment of a fee. Our contracts also contain provisions regarding indemnification against certain types of claims involving injury to persons, property, and for acts of pollution. The specific terms of these indemnifications are negotiable on a contract by contract basis.
The type of contract used determines our compensation. All of our contracts in 2018, 2017, and 2016 were daywork contracts. Under a daywork contract, we provide the drilling rig with the required personnel and the operator supervises the drilling of the well. Our compensation is based on a negotiated rate to be paid for each day the drilling rig is used. 
The majority of our contracts are on a well-to-well basis, with the rest under term contracts. Term contracts range from six months to three years and the rates can either be fixed throughout the term or allow for periodic adjustments.
Customers. During 2018, QEP Resources, Inc. and Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. were our largest third-party drilling customers accounting for approximately 16% and 10% of our total contract drilling revenues, respectively. Our work for this customer was under multiple contracts and our business was not substantially dependent on a single contract. None of these individual contracts were considered material. No other third-party customer accounted for 10% or more of our contract drilling revenues.
Our contract drilling segment also provides drilling services for our oil and natural gas segment. During 2018, 2017, and 2016, our contract drilling segment drilled 45, 27, and ten wells, respectively, for our oil and natural gas segment, or 8%, 6%, and 3%, respectively, of the total wells drilled by our contract drilling segment. Depending on the timing of the drilling services performed on our properties those services may be deemed, for financial reporting purposes, to be associated with acquiring an ownership interest in the property. Revenues and expenses for these services are eliminated in our statement of operations, with any profit recognized reducing our investment in our oil and natural gas properties. The contracts for these services are issued under similar terms and rates as the contracts signed with unrelated third parties. By providing drilling services for the oil and natural gas segment, we eliminated revenue of $22.5 million and $13.4 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively, from our contract drilling segment and eliminated the associated operating expense of $19.5 million and $11.8 million during 2018 and 
 2017, respectively, yielding $3.0 million and $1.6 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively, as a reduction to the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. We eliminated no revenue or expenses in our contract drilling segment during 2016. 
MID-STREAM
General. Our mid-stream operations are conducted through Superior Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and its subsidiaries. Its operations consist of buying, selling, gathering, processing, and treating natural gas. It operates three natural gas treatment plants, 14 processing plants, 22 active gathering systems, and approximately 1,475 miles of pipeline. Superior and its subsidiaries operate in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. We own 50% of Superior.
This table presents certain information regarding our mid-stream segment for the years indicated: 

 | Year Ended December 31, | | 
 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 
Gas gathered—Mcf/day | 393,613 | 385,209 | 419,217
Gas processed—Mcf/day | 158,189 | 137,625 | 155,461
NGLs sold—gallons/day | 663,367 | 534,140 | 536,494

Dispositions and Acquisitions. This segment had no significant dispositions or acquisitions during 2016 or 2017.
On April 3, 2018, we sold 50% of the ownership interest in our mid-stream segment, Superior. The purchaser is SP Investor Holdings, LLC, a holding company jointly owned by OPTrust and funds managed and/or advised by Partners Group, a global private markets investment manager. We received $300.0 million from this sale. A portion of the proceeds were used to pay down our bank debt and the remainder were used to accelerate the drilling program of our upstream subsidiary, Unit Petroleum Company and build additional BOSS drilling rigs. In connection with the sale of the interest in Superior, we took the necessary actions under the Indenture governing our outstanding senior subordinated notes to secure the ability to close the sale and have Superior released from the Indenture.
Superior will be governed and managed under its Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement and the Master Services and Operating Agreement (MSA) signed by Superior and an affiliate of Unit, as both agreements may be amended occasionally. Further details are in Note 16 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements.
Contracts. Our mid-stream segment provides its customers with a full range of gathering, processing, and treating services. These services are usually provided to each customer under long-term contracts (more than one year), but we have short-term contracts. Our customer agreements include these types of contracts: 
•Fee-Based Contracts. These contracts provide for a set fee for gathering, transporting, compressing, and treating services. Our mid-stream’s revenue is a function of the volume of natural gas and is not directly dependent on the value of natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 67% of our mid-stream segment’s total volumes and 61% of its operating margins (as defined below) were under fee-based contracts.
•Commodity-Based Contracts. These contracts consist of several contract structure types. Under these contract structures, our mid-stream segment purchases the raw well-head natural gas and settles with the producer at a stipulated price while retaining all sales proceeds from third parties or retains a negotiated percentage of the sales proceeds from the residue natural gas and NGLs it gathers and processes, with the remainder being paid to the producer. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 33% of our mid-stream segment’s total volumes and 39% of operating margins (as defined below) were under commodity-based contracts.
For each of the above contracts, operating margin is defined as total operating revenues less operating expenses and does not include depreciation, amortization, and impairment, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, or income taxes.
Customers. During 2018, ONEOK, Inc. accounted for approximately 45% of our mid-stream revenues. We believe that if we lost this customer, there are other customers available to purchase our gas and NGLs. During 2018, 2017, and 2016 our mid-stream segment purchased $81.4 million, $63.2 million, and $42.7 million, respectively, of our oil and natural gas segment's natural gas and NGLs production, and provided gathering and transportation services of $7.3 million, $6.7 million, and $9.2 million, respectively. Intercompany revenue from services and purchases of production between this business segment and our oil and natural gas segment has been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.
VOLATILE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS
The prevailing prices for oil, NGLs, and natural gas significantly affect our revenues, operating results, cash flow, and our ability to grow our operations. Oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices have been volatile, and they will probably continue to be so. For each period indicated, this table shows the highest and lowest average prices our oil and natural gas segment received for its sales of oil, NGLs, and natural gas without considering the effect of derivatives: 

 | Oil Price per Bbl | | | | NGLs Price per Bbl | | | Natural Gas Price per Mcf | |

Prices for oil, NGLs, and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the actual or perceived supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and many additional factors beyond our control, including:
•political conditions in oil producing regions;
•the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to agree on prices and their ability or willingness to maintain production quotas;
•actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations;
•the price of foreign oil imports;
•imports and exports of oil and liquefied natural gas;
•actions of governmental authorities;
•the domestic and foreign supply of oil, NGLs, and natural gas;
•the level of consumer demand;
•United States storage levels of oil, NGLs, and natural gas;
•weather conditions;
•domestic and foreign government regulations;
•the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels;
•volatility in ethane prices causing rejection of ethane as part of the liquids processed stream; and
•worldwide economic conditions.
These factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil, NGLs, and natural gas. You are encouraged to read the Risk Factors discussed in Item 1A of this report for additional risks that can affect our operations.
Our contract drilling operations depend on the level of demand in our operating markets. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices affect demand. Because oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices are volatile, the level of demand for our services is also volatile. 
Our mid-stream operations provide us greater flexibility in delivering our (and third parties) natural gas and NGLs from the wellhead to major natural gas and NGLs pipelines. Margins received for the delivery of these natural gas and NGLs depend on the price for oil, NGLs, and natural gas and the demand for natural gas and NGLs in our area of operations. If the price of NGLs falls without a corresponding decrease in the cost of natural gas, it may become uneconomical to us to extract certain NGLs. The volumes of natural gas and NGLs processed depend highly on the volume and Btu content of the natural gas and NGLs gathered.
COMPETITION
All of our businesses are highly competitive and price sensitive. Competition in the contract drilling business traditionally involves factors such as demand, price, efficiency, the condition of equipment, availability of labor and equipment, reputation, and customer relations.
Our oil and natural gas operations likewise encounter strong competition from other oil and natural gas companies. Many competitors have greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do and have more experience than we do in the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas.
Our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, during times of increased competition on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers, and other professionals. Competition for these professionals can be intense.
Our mid-stream segment competes with purchasers and gatherers of all types and sizes, including those affiliated with various producers, other major pipeline companies, and independent gatherers for the right to purchase natural gas and NGLs, build gathering and processing systems, and deliver the natural gas and NGLs once the gathering and processing systems are established. The principal elements of competition include the rates, terms, and availability of services, reputation, and the flexibility and reliability of service.
OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROGRAMS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Unit Petroleum Company serves as the general partner of 13 oil and gas limited partnerships (the employee partnerships) which were formed to allow certain of our qualified employees and our directors to participate in Unit Petroleum’s oil and gas exploration and production operations. Employee partnerships were formed for each year beginning with 1984 and ending with 2011. We also had three non-employee partnerships, one formed in 1984 and two formed in 1986 (investments by third parties). Effective December 31, 2014, the 1984 partnership was dissolved and effective December 31, 2016, the two 1986 partnerships were dissolved. 
The employee partnerships formed in 1984 through 1999 have been combined into a single consolidated partnership. The employee partnerships each have a set annual percentage (ranging from 1% to 15%) of our interest that the partnership acquires in most of the oil and natural gas wells we drill or acquire for our account during the year in which the partnership was formed. The total interest the participants have in our oil and natural gas wells by participating in these partnerships does not exceed one percent of our interest in the wells.
Under our partnership agreements, the general partner has broad discretionary authority to manage the business and operations of the partnership, including the authority to decide regarding the partnership’s participation in a drilling location or a property acquisition, the partnership’s expenditure of funds, and distributing funds to partners. Because the business activities of the limited partners and the general partner are different, conflicts of interest will exist, and it is impossible to entirely eliminate these conflicts. Additionally, conflicts of interest may arise when we are the operator of an oil and natural gas well and also provide contract drilling services. In these cases, the drilling operations are conducted under drilling contracts containing terms comparable to those contained in our drilling contracts with non-affiliated operators. We believe we fulfill our responsibility to each contracting party and comply fully with the terms of the agreements which regulate these conflicts.
Effective January 1, 2019, we elected to terminate and wind down all of the remaining employee limited partnerships. In accordance with the partnership agreements, we, as the liquidating trustees will value the interests of the limited partners using the formula provided in each partnership agreement and purchase those interests. Presently, we expect the total purchase price 
 for all of the limited partners interests will be approximately $0.6 million. We have no plans to sponsor additional employee limited partnerships.
These partnerships are further described in Notes 2 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
EMPLOYEES
As of February 12, 2019, we had approximately 913 employees in our contract drilling segment, 261 employees in our oil and natural gas segment, 125 employees in our mid-stream segment, and 77 in our general corporate area. None of our employees are members of a union or labor organization nor have our operations ever been interrupted by a strike or work stoppage. We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS
General. Our business depends on the demand for services from the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, and therefore our business can be affected by political developments and changes in laws and regulations that control or curtail drilling for oil and natural gas for economic, environmental, or other policy reasons.
Various state and federal regulations affect the production and sale of oil and natural gas. All states in which we conduct activities impose varying restrictions on the drilling, production, transportation, and sale of oil and natural gas. This discussion of certain laws and regulations affecting our operations should not be relied on as an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting us, due to the multitude of complex federal, state, and local regulations, and their susceptibility to change at any time by later agency actions and court rulings that may affect our operations.
Natural Gas Sales and Transportation. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas. FERC’s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas sales has been substantially modified by the Natural Gas Policy Act under which FERC continued to regulate the maximum selling prices of certain categories of gas sold in “first sales” in interstate and intrastate commerce. Effective January 1, 1993, however, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act (the Decontrol Act) deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas. Because “first sales” include typical wellhead sales by producers, all natural gas produced from our natural gas properties is sold at market prices, subject to the terms of any private contracts which may be in effect. FERC’s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas transportation is not affected by the Decontrol Act.
Our sales of natural gas are affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation. Beginning in 1985, FERC adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas. These changes are intended by FERC to foster competition by, among other things, transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of natural gas to the primary role of gas transporters. All natural gas marketing by the pipelines must divest to a marketing affiliate, which operates separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants. Because of the various omnibus rulemaking proceedings in the late 1980s and the later individual pipeline restructuring proceedings of the early to mid-1990s, interstate pipelines must provide open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation-related services to all producers, natural gas marketing companies, local distribution companies, industrial end users, and other customers seeking service. Through similar orders affecting intrastate pipelines that provide similar interstate services, FERC expanded the impact of open access regulations to certain aspects of intrastate commerce.
FERC has pursued other policy initiatives that affected natural gas marketing. Most notable are (1) the large-scale divestiture of interstate pipeline-owned gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non-affiliated companies; (2) further development of rules governing the relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates; (3) the publication of standards relating to using electronic bulletin boards and electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make available transportation information timely and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis; (4) further review of the role of the secondary market for released pipeline capacity and its relationship to open access service in the primary market; and (5) development of policy and promulgation of orders pertaining to its authorization of market-based rates (rather than traditional cost-of-service based rates) for transportation or transportation-related services on the pipeline’s demonstration of lack of market control in the relevant service market. 
Because of these changes, independent sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and can better conduct business with a larger number of counter parties. These changes generally have improved the access to markets for natural gas while substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace.
 However, we cannot predict what new or different regulations FERC and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect later regulations may have on production and marketing of natural gas from our properties.
Although in the past Congress has been very active in the area of natural gas regulation as discussed above, the more recent trend has been for deregulation and the promotion of competition in the natural gas industry. In addition to “first sales” deregulation, Congress also repealed incremental pricing requirements and natural gas use restraints previously applicable. There continually are legislative proposals pending in the Federal and state legislatures which, if enacted, would significantly affect the petroleum industry. It is impossible to predict what proposals might be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect these proposals might have on the production and marketing of natural gas by us. Similarly, and despite the trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry, whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on the production and marketing of natural gas by us cannot be predicted.
Oil and Natural Gas Liquids Sales and Transportation. Our sales of oil and natural gas liquids currently are not regulated and are at market prices. The prices received from the sale of these products are affected by the cost of transporting these products to market. Much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines. Effective as of January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. These regulations may increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline, although the annual adjustments could cause decreased rates in a given year. These regulations have generally been approved on judicial review. Every five years, FERC examines the relationship between the annual change in the index and the actual cost changes experienced by the oil pipeline industry and makes any necessary adjustment in the index to be used during the ensuing five years. We cannot predict with certainty what effect the periodic review of the index by FERC will have on us.
Exploration and Production Activities. Federal, state, and local agencies also have promulgated extensive rules and regulations applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, production, and related operations. The states we operate in require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and filing reports about operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration of oil and natural gas. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, and regulating spacing, plugging and, abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of some states limit the rate at which oil and natural gas is produced from our properties. The federal and state regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because these rules and regulations are amended or reinterpreted frequently, we cannot predict the future cost or impact of complying with these laws.
Environmental.
General. Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may require acquisition of permits before certain of our operations may be commenced and may restrict the types, quantities, and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment. Planning and implementation of protective measures must prevent accidental discharges. Spills of oil, natural gas liquids, drilling fluids, and other substances may subject us to penalties and cleanup requirements. Handling, storage, and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are subject to regulatory requirements.
The federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act, the federal Clean Air Act, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and their state counterparts, are the primary vehicles for imposition of such requirements and for civil, criminal, and administrative penalties and other sanctions for violation of their requirements. In addition, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and similar state statutes impose strict liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons considered responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such liability, which may be imposed for the conduct of others and for conditions others have caused, includes the cost of remedial action and damages to natural resources.
The EPA in 2015 established publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) effluent guidelines and standards for oil and gas extraction facilities which reflected industry best practices for unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities.
The EPA and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (Army) in 2015 proposed a new expansive definition of the “waters of the United States,” which the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed nationally. On February 28, 2017, an Executive Order was issued and directed that the EPA and Army consider interpreting the term “navigable waters” in a manner
 consistent with Justice Scalia’s opinion in Rapanos v. United States (2006). On March 6, 2017, the EPA and Army announced their intention to review and rescind or revise the 2015 Clean Water Rule and on June 27, 2017 they issued a proposed rule and written recommendations ("Obama rule"). On January 22, 2018, the United States Supreme Court in National Association of Manufacturers v. Department of Defense, et al. vacated the Sixth Circuit’s nationwide stay. As a result, on January 31, 2018, the EPA and Army issued a rule providing that the 2015 definition of “waters of the United States” will not apply until two years following the date this rule is published in the Federal Register. In addition, Army includes wetlands within its definition of “waters of the United States.” However, due to ongoing litigation, the Obama rule only applies to 28 states, and is enjoined with respect to the other 22 states challenging the Obama rule until such time as the litigation is resolved. On December 1, 2018, the EPA and Army released a proposed rule which would restrict the definition of “waters of the United States” to traditional large navigable waters, rivers and lakes and territorial seas used in interstate or foreign commerce as well as the tributaries, navigable lakes and ponds and tributaries that provide perennial or intermittent flow to them, as well as ditches that are “artificial channels” used to carry water and meet the conditions of a tributary or are adjacent to wetlands, impoundments of jurisdictional waters, and wetlands which are adjacent to jurisdictional waters in a “typical year” or which are connected by a channel to “waters of the United States.” In 2016, the United States Supreme Court in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes held that landowners can challenge in court an Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional determination. It is anticipated this decision will provide landowners an important tool in negotiating and resolving conflicts with federal agencies over the extent of wetlands on a property. During 2018, the United States Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits applied the so-called “hydrological connection” theory to extend jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act to cover pollutants that reach surface waters via groundwater. The Sixth Circuit addressed the same issue, but rejected the Fourth and Ninth Circuits’ decisions and held the opposite, consistent with 1994 Fifth Circuit and 2001 Seventh Circuit decisions. In response to an early December 2018 United States Supreme Court invitation to comment on the Fourth and Ninth Circuit’s decisions, the United States Solicitor General asked the United States Supreme Court to resolve the Circuit Courts’ split on whether the Clean Water Act applies when pollutants from a point source reach navigable waters after traveling through the groundwater. Petitions for review of the Fourth and Ninth Circuits’ decision were filed with the United States Supreme Court in October and briefing completed in November 2018.
Endangered Species Act. The federal Endangered Species Act, called the “ESA,” and analogous state laws regulate many activities, including oil and gas development, which could have an adverse effect on species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or their habitats. Designating previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause oil and natural gas exploration and production operators and service companies to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in affected areas, which impacts could adversely reduce drilling activities in affected areas. All three of our business segments could be subject to the effect of one or more species being listed as threatened or endangered within the areas of our operations. Numerous species have been listed or proposed for protected status in areas in which we provide or could undertake operations. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ("FWS") and the National Marine Fisheries ("NMFS") in 2016 issued final revised definitions relating to impacts on critical habitats for potentially endangered species allowing exclusion of certain areas if they will not result in the extinction of the species. In 2017, the Western Governor’s Association issued a Policy Resolution calling on Congress to amend and reauthorize the ESA based upon seven broad goals to make the act more workable and understandable. In December 2017, the Interior Department announced that it is working on possible changes to the ESA with the FWS to revise the regulations for listing endangered and threatened species and for designation of critical habitat. On July 19, 2018, the FWS and NMFS issued their proposals to revise the ESA regulations, to include: (1) reinstating the prior two-step approach to designating critical habitat, first considering designation of occupied habitat and then considering non-occupied habitat only if the existing inhabited area is inadequate to ensure conservation of the species; and (2) removal from the definition of “adverse modification” by deleting the second sentence in the definition which includes impact to land that “preclude or significantly delay development [physical or biological] features” essential to the conservation of the species. However, some of the new proposals may be impacted by the United States Supreme Court’s decision issued in late November 2018. In vacating a United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decision involving an endangered species, in Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the Supreme Court held that (1) a proposed site must be “habitat” for an endangered species before the FWS can designate it as “habitat that is critical” and (2) federal courts should review for an abuse of discretion the FWS’s decision not to exclude a site from designation. In other words, only the actual habitat of an endangered species can be designated critical habitat, meaning that an uninhabited area that otherwise meets the definition of critical habitat should not be so designated. The presence of protected species in areas where we provide contract drilling or mid-stream services or conduct exploration and production operations could impair our ability to timely complete or carry out those services and, consequently, hurt our results of operations and financial position.
Climate Change. Recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly called “greenhouse gases,” or GHGs, may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere. As a result there have been many regulatory developments, proposals or requirements, and legislative initiatives introduced in the United States (and other parts of the World) that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases.
In 2007, the United States Supreme Court in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA, held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an “air pollutant” under the federal Clean Air Act if it represents a health hazard to the public. On December 7, 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) responded to the Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA decision and issued a finding that the current and projected concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations, and that certain GHGs from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of GHG and hence to the threat of climate change. In addition, the EPA issued a final rule, effective in December 2009, requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large (25,000 metric tons or more) GHG emission sources in the U.S., beginning in 2011 for emissions in 2010. During 2010, the EPA proposed revisions to these reporting requirements to apply to all oil and gas production, transmission, processing, and other facilities exceeding certain emission thresholds. On May 12, 2016, the EPA issued three final rules that together will curb emissions of methane, smog-forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and toxic air-pollutants such as benzene from new, reconstructed and modified oil and natural gas sources, while providing greater certainty about Clean Air Act permitting requirements for the industry ("Methane Rule"). First, the EPA issued updates to the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for the oil and natural gas industry to add requirements that the industry reduce emissions of GHGs and to cover additional equipment and activities in the oil and natural gas distribution chain by setting emissions limits for methane and to require owners/operators to find and repair methane and VOC leaks. Second, the EPA issued a source determination rule regarding the EPA’s air permitting rules as they apply to the oil and natural gas industry. The EPA clarified when multiple pieces of equipment and activities must be deemed a single source for determining whether (i) major source Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Nonattainment New Source Review requirements apply regarding preconstruction permitting and (ii) a Title V Operating permit is required. Third, the EPA issued a final rule to implement the Minor New Source Review Program in Indian Country for oil and natural gas production designed to limit emissions of harmful air pollution while making the preconstruction permitting process more streamlined and efficient. These regulations will cause additional costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations and could hurt demand for the crude oil we gather, transport, store or otherwise handle in connection with our services. Although the EPA announced in April 2017 it will reconsider the GHG oil and gas emissions rule and delay its compliance, lawsuits have prevented such an effort. On September 1, 2018, the EPA proposed revisions to its Methane Rule, which the EPA estimates would “significantly reduce regulatory burden, saving the industry tens of millions of dollars in compliance each year.” The EPA proposes to revise (decrease) the monitoring frequencies for fugitive emissions (leaks) at non-low production well sites, low production well sites and compressor stations. The EPA also proposes to allow owners/operators up to 60 days after fugitive emissions are detected to complete repairs, provided that a first attempt at repair has to be made within the first 30 days.
Hydraulic Fracturing. Our oil and natural gas segment routinely applies hydraulic fracturing techniques to many of our oil and natural gas properties, including our unconventional resource plays in the Granite Wash of Texas and Oklahoma, the Marmaton of Oklahoma, the Wilcox of Texas, and the Mississippian of Kansas. On July 25, 2017, the Bureau of Land Management announced a proposal to rescind the 2015 Department of Interior final rule on hydraulic fracturing, a rule that was never in effect due to pending litigation. Multiple bills have been introduced in Congress that would (i) block federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing in favor of state rules, (ii) allow a state to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands within that state, (iii) prevent federal regulation of hydraulic regulation to apply to any land held in trust or restricted status for the benefit of Indians without their express consent, (iv) repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing in the Safe Drinking Water Act, and/or (v) require the disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition, certain states in which we operate, including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming have adopted, and other states and municipalities and other local governmental entities in some states, have and others are considering adopting regulations and ordinances that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure of fracking fluids, waste disposal, and well construction requirements on these operations, and even restrict or ban hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. 
On December 31, 2016, the EPA released its scientific Final Report on Impacts from Hydraulic Fracturing Activities on Drinking Water. The EPA states the report, which was done at the request of Congress, provides scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can affect drinking water resources in the United States under some circumstances. The EPA identifies six conditions under which impacts from hydraulic fracturing activities can be more frequent or severe and existing uncertainties and data gaps. Both the EPA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) have made statements indicating that activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may be causing earthquakes, with the focus being on wastewater disposal wells rather than injection wells. In an August 2015 report sent to the Texas Railroad Commission, the EPA stated it believes there is a significant possibility that North Texas earthquake activity is associated with disposal wells. The USGS has stated that hydraulic fracturing causes small earthquakes, but they are almost always too small to be detected. Regarding disposal wells, the USGS has stated that the injection of wastewater and salt water by deep wells into the subsurface can cause earthquakes that are large enough to be felt and may cause damage. As a result, the USGS and its university partners have deployed seismometers at sites of known or possible injection induced earthquakes in Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Ohio and Texas and that it is also developing methods to assess the earthquake hazard associated with wastewater injection wells. 
Any new laws, regulation, or permitting requirements regarding hydraulic fracturing could lead to operational delay, or increased operating costs or third party or governmental claims, and could result in additional burdens that could delay or limit the drilling services we provide to third parties whose drilling operations could be affected by these regulations or increase our costs of compliance and doing business and delay the development of unconventional gas resources from shale formations which are not commercial without using hydraulic fracturing. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the oil and natural gas we can ultimately produce from our reserves.
Other; Compliance Costs. We cannot predict future legislation or regulations. It is possible that some future laws, regulations, and/or ordinances could increase our compliance costs and/or impose additional operating restrictions on us as well as those of our customers. Such future developments also might curtail the demand for fossil fuels which could hurt the demand for our services, which could hurt our future results of operations. Likewise we cannot predict with any certainty whether any changes to temperature, storm intensity or precipitation patterns because of climate change (or otherwise) will have a material impact on our operations.
Compliance with applicable environmental requirements has not, to date, had a material effect on the cost of our operations, earnings, or competitive position. However, as noted above in our discussion of the regulation of GHGs and hydraulic fracturing, compliance with amended, new or more stringent requirements of existing environmental regulations or requirements may cause us to incur additional costs or subject us to liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
