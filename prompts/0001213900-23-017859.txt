Item 1. Business.
Overview



We are a global logistics integrated solution provider that was founded in the United States in 2001. We primarily focus on providing freight logistics services, which mainly include shipping, warehouse, resources, equipment, and other logistical support to steel companies and e-commerce businesses.



We previously focused on providing customized freight logistic services until 2017 when we began exploring new opportunities to expand our business and generate more revenue. These opportunities ranged from complementary businesses to other new service and product initiatives. In the fiscal year 2022, while we continued to provide our traditional freight business, we expanded our services to include warehousing services provided by our U.S. subsidiary Brilliant Warehouse Service Inc since August 2021. On January 3, 2022, we changed our corporate name to Singularity Future Technology Ltd. to align with our entry into the digital assets business through our U.S. subsidiaries. During 2022, we were engaged in purchases and sales of cryptocurrency mining machines through our U.S. subsidiaries and ceased this line of business in December 2022 following our settlement with SOSNY, as more fully described below under the heading “– Recent Developments – Settlement with SOS Information Technology New York, Inc.”



We are currently engaged in providing freight logistics services including warehouse services, which are operated by our subsidiaries Trans Pacific Shipping Limited and Ningbo Saimeinuo Supply Chain Management Ltd in China and Gorgeous Trading Ltd and Brilliant Warehouse Service Inc in the United States. Our range of services include transportation, warehouse, collection, first-mile delivery, drop shipping, customs clearance, and overseas transit delivery.



Since the publication of the Hindenburg Report (as defined below), we have devoted substantial resources and efforts in the cooperation with the investigation of the Special Committee and U.S. governmental authorities, as well as the settlements with investors and vendor and the defense of lawsuits, which are fully described below. As a result, our business operations have been materially and adversely impacted, including suspension of our business developments in North America. We are currently exploring new business opportunities while continuing to provide freight logistics services, which include shipping and warehouse services.



Recent Developments



Special Committee Investigation



On May 5, 2022, an entity named Hindenburg Research issued a report (the “Hindenburg Report”) regarding the Company alleging, among other things, that the Company’s then Chief Executive Officer, Yang Jie, was a fugitive on the run from Chinese authorities for running an alleged $300 million Ponzi scheme that lured in over 20,000 victims. The report also raised questions regarding the Company’s joint venture to produce crypto mining equipment announced in October 2021, as well as a $200 million order purportedly received by the joint venture in January 2022. Further, the report was critical of the Company’s April 2022 announcement of a $250 million partnership with an entity named Golden Mainland Inc. On May 6, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) formed a special committee of its Board of Directors (the “Special Committee”) to investigate claims of alleged fraud, misrepresentation, and inadequate disclosure related to the Company and certain of its management personnel raised in the Hindenburg Report and other related matters. The Special Committee then retained Blank Rome LLP to serve as independent legal counsel and advise the Committee on the investigation. The Special Committee completed the fact-finding portion of its investigation prior to December 31, 2022. The Special Committee’s preliminary findings corroborate certain of the allegations made in the Hindenburg Report and the investigation has resulted in the terminations and resignations of certain executive officers and directors of the Company, including but not limited to, the following:



On June 16, 2022, Ms. Tuo Pan, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, without proper authorization by the Board, directed that funds be wired to satisfy an invoice for legal services that were rendered or to be rendered to Ms. Pan personally. Ms. Pan was suspended by the Board for cause and without pay effective June 20, 2022. On August 31, 2022, Ms. Tuo Pan was terminated for cause as an employee and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and from any other position at any subsidiary of the Company to which she has been appointed in accordance with the terms of her Employment Agreement dated November 9, 2021 and will not receive any salary or benefits from the Company except those earned through August 31, 2022.

On August 9, 2022, Mr. Yang Jie tendered his resignation from his positions as the Chief Executive Officer and director of the Company to the Board, following the Board’s decision on August 8, 2022, which adopted the Special Committee’s recommendation that Mr. Jie be suspended immediately as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, pending the Special Committee’s further investigation into allegations raised in the report of Hindenburg Report and other related matters.



On August 16, 2022, the Staff and attorneys from Blank Rome LLP, counsel for the Special Committee, held a conference call, during which counsel represented that Yang Jie had provided documentation to the SEC that indicated that the charges against him in China had been dropped, but the Special Committee’s investigation raised questions regarding the authenticity of such documents. The Special Committee has concluded that Mr. Jie was in fact issued a “Red Notice” in China. In terms of remediating this issue, after being suspended by the Special Committee on August 8, 2022, Mr. Yang Jie had resigned from his positions as Chief Executive Officer and as a director of the Company on August 9, 2022.



On January 9, 2023, the Company entered into an Executive Separation Agreement and General Release (the “Separation Agreement”), with Lei Cao, an employee of the Company and a member of the Board, setting forth the terms and conditions related to (1) the termination of Mr. Cao’s employment with the Company and the termination of the employment agreement dated as of November 1, 2021 as well as cancellation and/or termination of certain other agreements relating to Mr. Cao’s employment with the Company; and (2) Mr. Cao’s resignation from the Board, effective as of January 9, 2023.



Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, Mr. Cao submitted a letter of resignation from the Board on January 9, 2023. In addition, he agreed to forfeit and return to the Company the 600,000 shares of common stock of the Company granted to him on August 13, 2021 under the terms of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan of the Company (the “2021 Shares”). Mr. Cao also agreed to cooperate with the Company regarding certain investigations and proceedings set forth in the Separation Agreement, and/or any other matters arising out of or related to Mr. Cao’s relationship with or service to the Company. In consideration, the Company agreed to provide the following benefits to which Mr. Cao was not otherwise entitled: (1) payment of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Mr. Cao up through January 9, 2023 associated with Mr. Cao’s personal legal representation in matters relating to Mr. Cao’s tenure with the Company, the investigations and proceedings set forth in the Separation Agreement, and the negotiation and drafting of the Separation Agreement; (2) the release of claims in Mr. Cao’s favor contained in the Separation Agreement; and (3) payment of Mr. Cao’s reasonable and necessary legal fees to the extent incurred by Mr. Cao as a result of his cooperation as required by the Company under the terms of the Separation Agreement. Additionally, the Separation Agreement contains mutual general releases and waiver of claims from Mr. Cao and the Company.



On February 23, 2023, the Board approved the dissolution of the Special Committee upon conclusion of the committee’s investigation. On the same day, John Levy resigned as a director and member of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating Committee of the Board, effective immediately.



Nasdaq Listing Deficiencies



On May 24, 2022, the Company received a delinquency notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) due to its delay in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. The Company was provided 60 days to submit a plan to regain compliance. On July 25, 2022 and September 14, 2022, the Company submitted its plan to regain compliance and supplementary information related to the plan, respectively (collectively, the “Compliance Plan”). Based on the review of the Compliance Plan as well as telephone conversations with outside counsel to the Company and counsel to the Company’s Special Committee, the Staff has determined that the Company did not provide a definitive plan evidencing its ability to file the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (collectively, the “Reports”) within the 180 calendar day period available to the Staff under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.





2







Specifically, the delisting determination referenced several aspects of the Compliance Plan that raise substantial doubts about the Company’s ability to regain compliance: (i) the unreasonably short timeframe for the Company to file the Reports based on the anticipated timeframe the Special Committee needs to substantially complete its investigation; (ii) the Company’s ability to engage a new independent registered public accounting firm; and (iii) the departure of both the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.



On November 16, 2022, the Company received an additional staff determination notice from Nasdaq, advising that it had not received the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2022, which served as an additional basis for delisting the Company’s securities and that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) will consider the additional deficiency in rendering a determination regarding the Company’s continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company has submitted to the Panel a plan to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements, including the filing of the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2022.



On January 5, 2023, the Company received a deficiency notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that its common stock, no par value, fails to comply with the $1 minimum bid price required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) based upon the closing bid price of the common stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the notice from Nasdaq. The Company has been provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until July 5, 2023, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.



On February 21, 2023, the Company received an additional staff determination notice from Nasdaq, advising that it had not received the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2022, which served as an additional basis for delisting the Company’s securities. The notice stated that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel will consider the additional deficiency in rendering a determination regarding the Company’s continued listing on Nasdaq. The Company has submitted to the Panel a plan to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements and has been granted a grace period to file all the delinquent reports, including the filing of the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2022, on or before February 28, 2023.



Settlement with SOS Information Technology New York, Inc.



SOS Information Technology New York, Inc. (“SOSNY”), a company incorporated under the laws of state of New York and a wholly owned subsidiary of SOS Ltd., filed a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court on December 9, 2022 against Thor Miner, Inc., which is the Company’s joint venture (“Thor Miner,” together with the Company, referred to as the “Corporate Defendants”), Lei Cao, Yang Jie, John F. Levy, Tieliang Liu, Tuo Pan, Shi Qiu, Jing Shan, and Heng Wang (jointly referred to as the “Individual Defendants”) (collectively, the Individual Defendants and the Corporate Defendants are the “Defendants”). SOSNY and Thor Miner entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated January 10, 2022 (the “PSA”) for the purchase of $200,000,000 in crypto mining rigs, which SOSNY claims was breached by the Defendants.



SOSNY and Defendants entered into a certain settlement agreement and general mutual release with an Effective Date of December 28, 2022 (the “Settlement Agreement”). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Thor Miner agreed to pay a sum of $13,000,000 (the “Settlement Payment”) to SOSNY in exchange for SOSNY dismissing the lawsuit with prejudice as to the settling Defendants and without prejudice as to all others. The full Settlement Payment was received by SOSNY on December 28, 2022. SOSNY dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice against Singularity (and other Defendants) on December 28, 2022.



The Company and Thor Miner further covenanted and agreed that if they receive additional funds from HighSharp (Shenzhen Gaorui) Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. (“HighSharp”) related to the PSA, they will promptly transfer such funds to SOSNY in an amount not to exceed $40,560,569 (which is the total amount paid by SOSNY pursuant to the PSA less the price of the machines actually received by SOSNY pursuant to the PSA). The Settlement Payment and any payments subsequently received by SOSNY from HighSharp shall be deducted from the total amount of $40,560,569 previously paid by, and now due and owing to SOSNY. In further consideration of the Settlement Agreement, Thor Miner agreed to execute and provide to SOSNY, within seven (7) business days after SOSNY’s receipt of the Settlement Payment, an assignment of all claims it may have against HighSharp or otherwise to the proceeds of the PSA.

On September 23, 2022, Hexin Global Limited and Viner Total Investments Fund filed a lawsuit against the Company and other defendants in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Hexin lawsuit”).

Each of these plaintiffs asserts causes of action for, among other things, violations of federal securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent inducement, breach of contract, conversion, and unjust enrichment, and seeks monetary damages and specific performance to remove legends from certain securities sold pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement. The Hexin lawsuit claims monetary damages of “at least $6 million,” plus interest, costs, fees, and attorneys’ fees.

On February 7, 2023, two additional plaintiffs moved to be appointed as the lead class plaintiff in this action; those motions remain under the Court’s consideration.

Corporate History and Our Business Segments



From inception in 2001 to our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, our sole business was providing shipping agency services. In general, we provided two types of shipping agency services: loading/discharging services and protective agency services, in which we acted as a general agent to provide value added solutions to our customers. For loading/discharging agency services, we received the total payment from our customers in U.S. dollars and paid the port charges on behalf of our customers in RMB. For protective agency services, we charged a fixed amount as agent fee while customers were responsible for the payment of port costs and expenses. 



In January 2016, we expanded our business to include freight logistics services to provide import security filing services with the U.S. Customs and Department of Homeland Security, on behalf of importers who ship goods into the U.S. and also provided inland transportation services to these importers in the U.S.



In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we also expanded into container trucking services as new business sectors to provide related transportation logistics services to customers in the U.S. and in China.



As an effort to further diversify our business, in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, we developed our bulk cargo container services segment. Bulk cargo container shipment refers to using containers to ship commodities that are traditionally shipped by freight cargo. Freight cargo rates are usually lower than container freight rates; however, the transit time is much longer and has high minimum quantity requirements. We temporarily suspended this service in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 due to market environment factors in 2019, and we have discontinued this service in light of the worldwide impact of the coronavirus pandemic.



In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, we established a wholly owned subsidiary, Ningbo Saimeinuo Supply Chain Management Ltd., which is 100% owned by Sino-Global Shipping New York Inc. (“SG Shipping NY”), a New York corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and primarily engages in transportation management and freight logistics services, including overseas shipping.



Since the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, trade dynamics have made it more expensive for shipping carrier clients to cost-effectively move cargo into U.S. ports, and as a result, we realized lower shipping volumes, which has caused us to shift our focus back to the shipping agency business.



On January 10, 2020, the Company entered into a cooperation agreement with Mr. Shanming Liang, a stockholder of the Company and set up a joint venture with Mr. Liang in New York named LSM Trading Ltd., in which the Company holds a 40% equity interest. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company invested $210,000. The joint venture has not commenced any business operations as of the date of this Report.

On July 7, 2020, the Company effected a l-for-5 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The split did not change the number of authorized shares of common stock or preferred stock, or the par value of common stock or preferred stock. As a result, all the issued and outstanding common stock share amounts included in this filing have been retroactively reduced by a factor of five, and all common stock per share amounts have been increased by a factor of five.



On December 14, 2020, the Company incorporated a new entity named Blumargo IT Solution Ltd. (“Blumargo”) in the U.S. SG Shipping NY held an 80% ownership interest in Blumargo, which was established in partnership with Tianjin Anboweiye Technology Co., to build up hi-tech and information-based logistics services to meet the demand of its customers. On June 30, 2021, SG Shipping NY acquired the additional 20% from Tianjin Anboweiye Technology Co. and increased its ownership to 100%.



From March to June 2021, the Company engaged in cryptocurrency mining in China. On March 2, 2021, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with Hebei Yanghuai Technology Co., Ltd. (“Yanghuai”) for the purchase of 2,783 digital currency mining machines for a total purchase price of approximately $4.6 million.  After the purchase, Yanghuai would manage and operate the servers at its site with no further charge from March 10, 2021 to March 9, 2022, after which time the Company may engage Yanghuai to continue providing service for a fee. The first cash payment of approximately $0.9 million was paid within 15 days after the date of signing the Agreement.



Over the last two months of the Company’s 2021 fiscal year, national and local governments in China started to restrict and ban cryptocurrency mining operations, causing owners of mining machines to cease mining operations. Based on the amended agreement signed by the Company and Yanghuai on September 17, 2021, the Company is not liable to perform under the remainder of the contract and has title to half of the products. The Company recorded impairment for the mining equipment in the last quarter of 2021 in the amount of approximately $0.9 million. the two parties have restructured the Purchase Agreement to reduce the purchase price from RMB 30 million to RMB 6 million and to allocate the purchased mining equipment between the Company and the Seller. The Seller transported digital currency mining machines representing half of the agreed 50,440 terahashes per second (th/s) in computing power (or a total of 25,220 th/s in computing power) to Ningbo, China first, and then shipped to the U.S. 



On April 21, 2021, the Company set up a joint venture in Texas, U.S. under the name of “Brilliant Warehouse Service Inc.” to support its freight logistics services in the U.S., pursuant to a cooperation agreement with Mr. Bangpin Yu. SG Shipping NY has a 51% equity interest in the joint venture. 



In July 2021, the Company registered a new company, Gorgeous Trading Ltd. (“Gorgeous Trading”), which is 100% owned by SG Shipping NY. Gorgeous Trading is mainly engaged in smart warehouse and related business in Texas. 



On August 31, 2021, the Company formed a joint venture, Phi Electric Motor, Inc. in New York, which is 51% owned by SG Shipping NY. Phi Electric Motor, Inc. had no operations as of the date of this Report.



On September 29, 2021, the Company formed a 100% owned subsidiary, SG Shipping & Risk Solution Inc., in New York. On December 23, 2021, SG Shipping & Risk Solution Inc. formed SG Link LLC in New York, of which it is a 100% owner. As of the date of this Report, the two companies have had no operations.



On October 3, 2021, the Company entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with HighSharp to establish a joint venture for collaborative engineering, technical development and commercialization of a bitcoin mining machine under the name Thor Miner Inc., granting Thor Miner exclusive rights covering design production, intellectual property, branding, marketing and sales. On October 11, 2021, Thor Miner was formed in Delaware, which is 51% owned by the Company and 49% owned by HighSharp.

On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into a series of agreements to terminate its variable interest entity (“VIE”) structure and deconsolidated its formerly controlled entity Sino-Global Shipping Agency Ltd. (“Sino-China”). The Company controlled Sino-China through its wholly owned subsidiary Trans Pacific Shipping Limited. The Company made the decision to dissolve the VIE structure and Sino-China because Sino-China has no active operations and the Company wanted to remove any potential risks associated with any VIE structures. In addition, the Company dissolved its subsidiary Sino-Global Shipping LA, Inc.



On April 10, 2022, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Golden Mainland Inc., a Georgia corporation (“Golden Mainland”) to establish a joint venture for building Bitcoin mining sites in Texas, Ohio, and other states.

Our Competition



The market segment that we now operate in, which is freight logistics services including warehouse services, does not have high entry barriers. In terms of our competition in China, there are many companies ranging from small to large that provide freight logistics services, and the state-owned companies in China generate a significant portion of the revenues in the industry. Our primary competitors in China are the China branches of international shipping companies or their exclusive agents in China. These companies include Evergreen Marine Corp., Orient Overseas Container Line, Ocean Network Express which includes Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha. The competition is intense due to the significant excess capacity. These companies have greater service capabilities, a larger customer base and more financial, marketing, network and human resources than we do. Most of them engage in a wide range of businesses and involve many aspects of the industry chain. However, we focus on providing tailored solutions and value-added services to customers in freight logistic services. As a boutique company with limited resources and history, we face intense competition. Our ability to grow in our industry depends on (1) our deep understanding of the complexity of industry issues and challenges and (2) our ability to develop optimal solutions to respond to the identified issues and provide effective problem-solving strategies to our targeted customers.



In terms of our competition in the United States, the freight logistics services industry is well developed, highly fragmented, and competition is fierce nationwide. Our primary competitors in the U.S. are local warehouse services providers and freight forwarding companies in Houston, for example, Bizto LLC, Golden Eagle Guns LLC, and Smart Supply Chain. Competition in the freight logistics services industry is driven by factors such as price, service quality, technology, and geographic reach. Companies that can offer a combination of these factors are often more competitive in the market. Additionally, companies that can adapt to changing customer demands and market trends, such as the shift towards e-commerce, are likely to be more successful in the long term. We aim at providing tailored and valued-added services for our international clients with needs for U.S. domestic logistics services.
