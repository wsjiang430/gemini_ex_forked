Item 1. Business.
General Development of the Business.
UFP Industries, Inc. (“we” or “our”) is a holding company with subsidiaries throughout North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia that supply products primarily manufactured from wood, wood and non-wood composites, and other materials to three markets: retail, packaging, and construction. We are headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan. For more information about UFP Industries, Inc., or our affiliated operations, go to www.ufpi.com.
Information relating to current developments in our business is incorporated by reference from our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 ("2022 Annual Report") under the caption "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Selected portions of the 2022 Annual Report are filed as Exhibit 13 with this Form 10-K Report.
Financial Information About Segments.
ASC 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”) defines operating segments as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
Our business segments consist of UFP Retail Solutions, UFP Packaging and UFP Construction and align with the end markets we serve. Among other things, this structure allows for a more specialized and consistent sales approach among Company operations, more efficient use of resources and capital, and quicker introduction of new products and services. We manage the operations of our individual locations primarily through a market-centered reporting structure under which each location is included in a business unit and business units are included in our Retail, Packaging, and Construction segments. The exception to this market-centered reporting and management structure is our International segment, which comprises our Mexico, Canada, Europe, Asia and Australia operations and sales and buying offices in other parts of the world. Our International segment and Ardellis (our insurance captive) are referred to as “All Other” throughout this report. The Corporate segment includes purchasing, transportation and administrative functions that serve our operating segments. Operating results of Corporate primarily consists of over (under) allocated costs, the operating results of UFP Real Estate, Inc., which owns and leases real estate, and UFP Transportation Ltd., which owns, leases and operates transportation equipment, are also included in Corporate. Inter-company lease and services charges are assessed to our operating segments for the use of these assets and services at fair market value rates.
Narrative Description of Business.
Historically, we owned and operated a number of manufacturing facilities across North America that served our various markets, and we managed those operations primarily on a geographic basis. As part of that structure, the managers of those facilities and geographic business units were responsible for and compensated on the basis of each facility's, unit's, and region's respective financial performance. This structure fostered a strong entrepreneurial and sales culture, as well as significant revenue growth – from 2011 to 2019 our revenues increased from $1.8 billion to $4.4 billion. We believe that the duration of our relationships with many of our customers, which extend over several decades with certain key customers, is a reflection of our strong sales culture and intense focus on providing custom solutions.

Our growth, including the growth in the size and number of our customers, generated increased demand for a deeper understanding of the markets we serve as well as the need to offer more complete solutions, services, and products for existing and prospective customers. As a result, effective January 1, 2020, we restructured the manner in which we manage our business and serve our customers, prompting the formation of three business segments: Retail Solutions, Packaging, and Construction. This restructuring, focused on our markets, is intended to allow us to better serve our customers, recognize and exploit market opportunities, enhance the efficiency of our operations, and improve the deployment of capital. At the same time, we continue to maintain our existing compensation philosophy and practices of rewarding the financial performance of our plants, business units, and segments, based upon pre-bonus operating profits and return on investment, to preserve our strong entrepreneurial and sales culture.
Our business segments are functionally interdependent and are supported by common corporate services, such as accounting and finance, information technology, human resources, legal and compliance, and others. We regularly invest in automation and create best practices to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities across each of the segments. The results and improvements from these investments are shared among the segments. This exchange of improvements and ideas has also prompted better and faster innovation for new products, processes, and product improvements.
Importantly, the restructuring allows us to better evaluate market conditions and opportunities and more effectively allocate capital and resources to the appropriate segments and business units. Also, we believe that the diversification and manner in which we operate our business provides an inherent hedge against the inevitable business cycles that our markets experience and over which we have little control. Accordingly, our goal is to provide more stable earnings and cash flows to our shareholders. Our diversification and operating practices also mitigate the impact of more volatile lumber market conditions experienced by traditional lumber companies.
Retail Solutions segment. Our Retail Solutions segment is comprised of the following business units: ProWood, Sunbelt, Deckorators and UFP-Edge. The Retail Solutions segment is focused on distinct product offerings which are grouped by brands and business units. These groupings may change periodically as opportunities to gain efficiencies or development of bigger scale and synergy products are created.
ProWood and Sunbelt. Our ProWood and Sunbelt business units manufacture and sell treated lumber products, including decking, fencing, lattice and similar products, as well as decorative and functional lawn and garden products. These business units include our branded ProWood line of pressure-treated and fire retardant products used primarily for outdoor decking environments, including associated accessories. It also includes our branded Outdoor Essentials line of lawn and garden products, consisting of wood and vinyl fencing options, garden beds and planters, pergolas, picnic tables, and other landscaping products. These business units also manufacture and sell commodity based lumber primarily to independent, retail lumber yards.
Deckorators. This business unit includes the manufacture of wood plastic composite and our patented mineral based, composite decking and related decking accessories, including non-wood railing systems, balusters, post caps, and similar products, as well as customized, non-wood fencing.
UFP-Edge. This business unit manufactures and sells exterior siding, pattern, trim and facia products. These products include traditional wood, engineered wood and modified wood siding with a variety of finish and profile alternatives as well as primed wood trim boards and facia. It also includes interior pattern and trim products, as well as pre-painted and primed shiplap and project boards.
We are not aware of any competitor that currently manufactures, treats and distributes a full line of both value-added and commodity-based products on a national basis as we do within this segment. We face competition on individual products from several different producers; however, the majority of these competitors tend to be regional in their efforts and/or do not offer the full line of products that are available from us. We believe the breadth of our product offering, scale and geographic dispersion, proximity of our plants to core customers, product innovation initiatives, purchasing and manufacturing expertise, and service capabilities provide competitive advantages in this market. We estimate we produce approximately 28% of all residential treated wood, 5-6% of all composite decking and accessories, and 9% of all wood and vinyl fencing in the United States.

We supply customers in this segment from many of our locations. Our facilities are able to supply mixed truckloads of products that can be delivered to customers with rapid turnaround from receipt of an order. Freight costs are a factor in the ability to competitively service this market, especially with treated wood products because of their heavier weight. The proximity of our regional facilities to the various outlets of these customers is a factor when developing and establishing annual sales programs. This segment services two of our largest customers, The Home Depot and Lowes, which accounted for approximately 15% and 11%, respectively, of our total net sales in fiscal 2022, 16% and 10%, respectively, in 2021, and 24% and 4%, respectively, in 2020.
See Note M "Segment Reporting" of the registrant's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 for our disaggregated net sales by business unit for our Retail Solutions segment.
Packaging segment. Formerly known as our Industrial segment, this segment is comprised of the following business units: Structural Packaging, PalletOne, and Protective Packaging Solutions.
Structural Packaging. This business unit designs, engineers, manufactures and tests custom packaging products primarily made of wood. These products are custom designed and manufactured based upon specific customer needs and requirements. We serve a wide variety of regional, national, and global customers in several end markets (also referred to by us as "runways") such as durable goods, household goods, agricultural, moving and storage, heavy equipment and automotive. We utilize combinations of various materials through industrial engineering and testing to promote the best value and functionality for our customers.
PalletOne. This business unit designs and manufactures pallets primarily made out of wood and heat-treated wood. Our pallets are designed and manufactured in numerous sizes and compositions and are used by our customers for shipping a wide assortment of consumer and industrial products. This business unit also includes a large recycling operation of previously used pallets.
Protective Packaging Solutions. This business unit consists of a wide variety of products and solutions, such as corrugate, foam, labels, strapping and films. These products are primarily sold as additional offerings to our structural packaging products and pallets and are generally sold as a means of providing a more complete solution to our customers' packaging desires and requirements. Over the last five years, we have added additional products and services to this business unit to meet the increasing demand of our customers to provide innovative solutions to their packaging and shipping needs.
Competition in our structural packaging and PalletOne business units is fragmented and includes numerous suppliers of wood components convenient to the customer. We service this segment with our dedicated regional and national sales teams. We believe we currently supply approximately 15% of all domestic customized structural packaging and have a 10% market share of new machine-built wood pallets. Our Protective Packaging business unit includes recent acquisitions: Advantage Label, Titan Corrugated, and All Boxed Up. We plan to continue to acquire companies with capabilities and product expertise that enhance our ability to offer valuable packaging solutions to our customers.
See Note M "Segment Reporting" of the registrant's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 for our disaggregated net sales by business unit for our Packaging segment.
Construction segment. Our construction segment is comprised of the following business units – Factory-Built Housing, Site-Built Construction, Commercial Construction, and Concrete Forming.

4



Factory-Built Housing. This business unit designs and manufactures roof trusses, lumber cut and shaped to the customer's specification, plywood, oriented strand board and dimensional lumber, all intended for use in the construction of manufactured housing. Our customers in this market are producers of mobile, modular and prefabricated homes and, to a lesser extent, recreational vehicles (RV). Our principal competitive advantages include our product knowledge, the strength of our engineering support services, the proximity of our regional facilities to our customers, our purchasing and manufacturing expertise and our ability to provide national sales programs to certain customers. As a result of these advantages, we estimate we produce approximately 45% of all roof trusses used in factory-built housing in the United States. We also distribute products such as siding, electrical, plumbing, and many other specialty products to factory-built housing and RV customers.
Site-Built Construction. This business unit designs and manufactures roof and floor trusses, wall panels, I-joists and lumber packages as well as engineered wood components used to frame residential and light commercial projects. We have recently begun to manufacture and sell alternate materials components such as metal trusses, sheathed and pre-finished light gauge metal wall panels and aluminum decks and rail accessories. Our customers in this market are primarily large-volume, multi-tract builders and smaller volume custom builders. We also supply builders engaged in multi-family and light commercial construction. We currently estimate that approximately 75% of the unit's business is for single-family homes while 25% is for multi-family structures.
Competition consists of a number of national and regional building products dealers who also manufacture components and/or provide framing services, as well as many regional manufacturers of engineered wood components. We believe our primary competitive advantages relate to the engineering and design capabilities of our staff, purchasing and manufacturing expertise, product quality, timeliness of delivery, and financial strength, as well as providing a comprehensive turn-key package, including installation in selected markets. As a result of these strengths, we estimate we produce approximately 6% of all engineered wood components used in housing in the United States. Generally, terms of sale and pricing are determined based on contracts we entered into with our customers. We currently supply customers in these markets from manufacturing facilities located in many different states, primarily located in the non-urban Northeast, mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Texas, and Colorado. We have intentionally avoided markets that have experienced more severe volatility and demand for housing. Also, the states in which we have a presence are currently benefiting from recent population migration trends in the United States. Freight costs are a factor in the ability to competitively service this market due to the space requirements of these products on each truckload. We also provide framing services for builders in certain regional markets in which we erect the wood structure. 
Commercial Construction. Our commercial construction business unit primarily includes the operations of idX Holdings, Inc. ("idX"). idX is a designer, manufacturer and installer of highly customized interior fixtures, casework and millwork used in a variety of retail and commercial structures representing several end markets. This business unit serves customers throughout North America and to a lesser extent, Asia, in runways such as healthcare, hospitality, quick service restaurants, retail, and financial. We believe that we have a market share of approximately 3% of the total domestic and architectural millwork market.
Concrete Forming. This business unit designs, manufactures and supplies wood forms and related products that are used by our customers to set or form concrete for various structures, including large parking garages, stadiums, bridges, water treatment plants, and other large infrastructure projects. Our customers in this business unit include general contractors as well as distributors.
See Note M "Segment Reporting" of the registrant's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 for our disaggregated net sales by business unit for our Construction segment.
UFP Purchasing/Suppliers. We are one of the largest domestic buyers of solid sawn softwood lumber from primary producers (lumber mills). For 2022, we estimate that we purchased approximately 7% of the 53 billion board feet of North America softwood production. Our purchasing team manages and purchases wood fiber for each of our segments. The significance of our volume and variety of lumber dimensions purchased allows us to consume substantially all of what many of our mill suppliers produce. This has allowed us to maintain long-term relationships with many of those suppliers. In turn, this has allowed us to better manage our raw materials inventory (including managed inventory), lower our costs, and mitigate the volatility of lumber prices.

We use primarily southern yellow pine in our pressure-treating operations and site-built component plants in the Southeastern United States. Southern yellow pine is sourced from mills located throughout the states comprising the Sunbelt. Other species we use include "spruce-pine-fir" from various provinces in Canada; hemlock, douglas fir and cedar from the Pacific Northwest; inland species of pine, plantation grown radiata and southern yellow pines from South America; and European spruce. During 2022 our annual purchases of lumber totaled approximately $3.0 billion and consisted of the following species and their respective percent of total lumber purchases: southern yellow pine (60%), spruce-pine-fir (19%), and douglas fir (4%), while the remaining 17% of lumber purchases comprise various other species and imports outside of North America. Additionally, we purchased approximately $911.2 million in plywood in 2022. There are numerous primary producers for all varieties we use, and we are not dependent on any particular source of supply.
Intellectual Property. We own numerous patents and have several patents pending on technologies related to our business. In addition, we own numerous registered trademarks and claim common law trademark rights to several others. As we develop proprietary brands, we may pursue registration or other formal protection. While we believe our patent and trademark rights are valuable, the loss of a patent or any trademark would not be likely to have a material adverse impact on our competitive position.
Backlog. Due to the nature of our retail and industrial businesses, backlog information is not meaningful. The maximum time between receipt of a firm order and shipment does not usually exceed a few days. Therefore, we would not normally have a backlog of unfilled orders in a material amount. The relationships with our major customers are such that we are either the exclusive supplier of certain products and/or certain geographic areas, or the designated source for a specified portion of the customer's requirements. In such cases, either we are able to forecast the customer's requirements, or the customer may provide an estimate of its future needs. In neither case, however, will we receive firm orders until just prior to the anticipated delivery dates for the products in question.
On December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, we estimate that backlog orders associated with our customized interior fixture businesses approximated $136.7 million and $84.6 million, respectively.
On December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, we estimate that backlog orders associated with our site-built construction businesses approximated $91.1 million and $113.5 million, respectively. We expect that the orders above will be primarily filled within the next fiscal year; however, it is possible that some orders could be canceled.
Environmental. Information required for environmental disclosures is incorporated by reference from Note L of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 8 herein.
Seasonality. Information required for seasonality disclosures is incorporated by reference from Item 1A. Risk Factors under the caption “Seasonality and weather conditions could adversely affect us.”
Human Capital Management. On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 15,500 employees. For over 65 years, the success of our company has rested on the skill, motivation and performance of our employees. We treat our people honestly and fairly, creating career paths and training opportunities to develop and expand their scope of responsibilities and financial rewards. This approach to human capital, which is embedded in the Company's culture, has fostered an environment where our employees often commit their respective careers to UFP Industries, Inc.
Environmental, Social, and Governance. Matters of sustainability, health and safety, employee welfare, supply chain management, and community engagement are managed by our executive team, with oversight from our Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Personnel and Compensation Committees. We will share our ESG Report in March of 2023, by publishing on our website, in which we will detail our current state as well as our future outlook. 
Our manufacturing operations have a long history of environmental stewardship through efficiency and energy savings, waste management, and responsible product sourcing. We quantify our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and are committed to disclosing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in 2023.

We are driven by operational excellence throughout the enterprise and by cultivating a unique culture that provides significant opportunity for professional and personal growth. In managing our human capital, we have focused our efforts on employee health and safety, equal opportunity for all, and learning and development. 
At UFP we welcome all who are willing to work hard. We do not discriminate in hiring, promotion, or opportunity – we believe the best performers should be rewarded commensurately. We prefer hiring people with potential and helping them grow and achieve their goals within our company. To provide opportunity to a broader base of our teammates we removed the requirement of a 4-year degree for sales and management positions and give credit for work experience. We use our internal training programs and UFP Business School to help employees gain functional knowledge and hone the skills and competencies that allow them advancement to greater roles and responsibilities. 
We have a long history of supporting talented and hard-working employees go from factory floor to management, sales and operations roles. These transformations require diligence and dedication, and they demonstrate that regardless of background, our teammates at UFP have a chance to make a better life for themselves and their families. We also recognize the need to hire talented individuals from outside the company who bring special expertise and innovative skills to UFP.
